[NASA] THREE-DAY TRAINING COURSE ON PLANETARY PROTECTION

Course: "Planetary Protection: Policies and Practices"
Dates: February 24-26, 2015
Location: Kennedy Space Center, Florida

We cordially invite all interested parties to participate in the 
upcoming course on Planetary Protection Policies and Practices, which 
is designed to familiarize current and future practitioners with 
NASA, ESA, and COSPAR planetary protection programs. The course 
provides an overview of applicable policies, practices and procedures 
necessary to implement a successful planetary protection program, 
emphasizing integration of managerial, administrative, and laboratory 
activities. It is supported by the NASA Planetary Protection Officer.

FIRST ANNOUNCEMENT: 11TH IAA LOW-COST PLANETARY MISSION CONFERENCE 
(LCPM-11)

The International Academy of Astronautics (IAA) LCPM-11 will be held 
on 9-11 June 2015, in Berlin, Germany, at the Archenhold Sternwarte 
located in one of the largest parks in the city. The meeting web site:

http://www.dlr.de/LCPM11 

has just gone live and will be updated regularly. We will convene in 
the Einstein Saal, the venue where Albert Einstein gave his first 
public lecture on the theory of relativity. The co-chairs, Tilman 
Spohn, German Aerospace Center (DLR) Institute of Planetary Research, 
and Gregg Vane, NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) Solar System 
Exploration Directorate, will work with the program committee
and soon announce the preliminary program. Please mark your 
calendars now for this important meeting.

NASA POSTDOCTORAL FELLOWSHIPS

The NASA Postdoctoral Program (NPP) provides opportunities for 
scientists and engineers to conduct research largely of their own 
choosing, yet compatible with the research opportunities posted on 
the NPP Web site.

Selected by a competitive peer-review process, NPP Fellows complete 
one- to three-year Fellowship appointments that advance NASA's 
missions in earth science, heliophysics, planetary science, 
astrophysics, space bioscience, aeronautics and engineering, human 
exploration and space operations, and astrobiology.

A sample research opportunities is:

https://www3.orau.gov/NPDoc/Catalog/18818

Applicants must have a Ph.D. or equivalent degree in hand before 
beginning the fellowship, but may apply while completing the degree 
requirements. U. S. citizens, Lawful Permanent Residents, and 
foreign nationals eligible for J-1 status as a Research Scholar 
may apply.

Stipends start at $53,500 per year, with supplements for high cost-
of-living areas and for certain academic specialties. Financial 
assistance is available for relocation and health insurance, and 
$8,000 per year is provided for professional travel.

Applications are accepted three times each year: March 1, July 1, 
and November 1.

TENURE TRACK FACULTY POSITION IN CHEMISTRY OF PLANETARY ATMOSPHERES, 
UNIVERSITY OF LEEDS

University Academic Fellow in Chemistry of Planetary Atmospheres
School of Chemistry, Faculty of Mathematics and Physical Sciences
University of Leeds, UK

This University Academic Fellowship (UAF) is a tenure track equivalent 
post for future academic leaders which provides an excellent 
opportunity to establish an academic career at a research intensive 
University and play a key role in our ambitious plans for the future. 
You will embark on a structured five year development programme, 
successful completion of which will lead to your appointment as a 
grade 9 Associate Professor. The School of Chemistry has an 
international reputation in observing, modelling and performing 
laboratory experiments to understand the Earthâ€™s atmosphere. We are 
seeking to expand our research and teaching expertise in chemical 
studies related to the atmospheres of other solar-system bodies and 
the atmospheres of extra-solar planets. Our current work in this area 
includes a laboratory and modelling study of Titan's organic photo-
chemistry and the impacts of cosmic dust in the upper atmospheres of 
several planets.

[NASA] PDS - ODYSSEY DATA RELEASE 49 - GRS

Mars Odyssey GRS/HEND data sets covering the data acquisition period 
January 1 to March 31, 2014, have now been released, two weeks after 
the scheduled release date of October 1. The Neutron Spectrometer data 
for this time period have not yet been received at PDS; they will be 
included in the next release, on January 2, 2015.

2ND ANNOUNCEMENT: WORKSHOP ON GROUND & SPACE OBSERVATORIES: 
A JOINT VENTURE TO PLANETARY SCIENCE

Registration has now opened for the ESO/ESA/ALMA/NRAO-NAASC 
workshop on: "Ground and Space Observatories: A Joint Venture to
Planetary Science" 

March 2-5, 2015 
Santiago, Chile 

http://www.eso.org/sci/meetings/2015/Planets2015.html 

The goal of this workshop is to explore synergies between ground and
space-based observatories with planetary missions for exploring the
Solar System and planets, and to foster collaborations between the
different communities by sharing scientific and technical knowledge,
needs, requirements, and techniques.

We are also pleased to announce that Michael Mumma (NASA/GSFC) will 
be giving a keynote at the beginning of the workshop. The remaining 
list of invited speakers will be announced soon on the website of 
the workshop.

The meeting will be held at the ESO office in Santiago, and will be
limited to around 100 participants. The registration fee is 250 euros,
which will cover coffee breaks, lunches at ESO, and a winery tour and
conference dinner on Wednesday, March 4. For students, the registration
fee is 150 euros. We have financial support for a limited number of
students.

Abstract submission deadline: November 24, 2014.

We hope to see you in Santiago!

[NASA] ROSES-14 RELEASE OF A NEW CALL: K2 GUEST OBSERVER - CYCLE 2

This program element solicits proposals for the acquisition and 
analysis of new scientific data from the K2 mission: 

http://keplerscience.arc.nasa.gov/K2

K2 repurposes the space-borne hardware and ground-based operations of 
the Kepler mission for a pointed survey of pre-determined locations 
along the ecliptic plane. The single, visible-wavelength instrument 
onboard K2 provides high-precision photometry capability, with short 
cadence and long cadence modes (1 minute and 30 minute exposures), and 
provides a powerful tool for broadband variability analyses of 
planetary, stellar, extragalactic, and solar system sources.

Only proposers who submit a Step-1 proposal will be eligible to submit 
a Step-2 (full) proposal. Potential proposers are strongly encouraged 
to carefully read the information about the 2-step proposal process 
provided in Section IV(b)(vii) of the ROSES-2014 Summary of 
Solicitation and Section 4 of D.13.

Step-1 proposals due: January 16, 2015
Proposals due: February 27, 2015
