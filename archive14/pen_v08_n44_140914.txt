NOEL HINNERS, 1935-2014

Noel Hinners, a former chief scientist for NASA who helped plan the 
scientific exploration of the moon for the Apollo program and later 
oversaw projects such as the Mars Surveyor Program, has died.

Hinners' brother Bill Hinners said Saturday that Hinners died Friday 
after battling a brain tumor. He was 78.

Hinners began his meteoric space career in 1963 by helping plan the 
lunar exploration and was just 33 when Apollo 11 landed on the moon. 
He worked on the Apollo program until 1972, when he became the space 
agency's director of lunar programs. He later served as the director 
of the National Air and Space Museum in Washington and the director of 
the Goddard Space Flight Center. He retired from NASA as its 
third-ranking executive. (From the Washington Post)

THE 4TH INTERNATIONAL WORKSHOP ON LUNARCUBES

"Opening the Lunar Frontier" - will be held October 7-10, 2014 
in Sunnyvale, CA.

Scientists, engineers, investors and entrepreneurs are invited to 
attend this four day, interactive workshop to learn exactly how these 
tiny satellites are being used to explore space and the enormous 
potential they carry in opening the Lunar Frontier. The first three 
days of LunarCube Workshop 4 (LCW 4) will focus on the science, 
technology, missions and systems involved in using CubeSats, while the 
fourth day will focus on "Entrepreneurship for the Lunar Frontier".

Don't sit on the sidelines. Learn how powerful and cost effective 
SmallSat technology can be in a super friendly, interactive learning 
environment. If you have questions, contact info@lsaworkshops.com.

EARLY MARS POSTDOC AT UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO

Department of the Geophysical Sciences at The University of Chicago 
seeks to hire a postdoctoral researcher to support investigations of 
the early climate of Mars through analysis of Mars topography and 
forward modeling of topographic change. The successful candidate will 
work with Assistant Professor Edwin Kite to assemble, analyze, and 
model crater-modification and crater-infilling datasets. Candidates 
should have a background in Planetary Science, Earth Science, or 
Astrophysics, and have experience working with large datasets. 
Experience with Mars is helpful but is not required. Start date is 
flexible. The successful candidate will also have the opportunity to 
develop a program of independent research aligned with the objectives 
of the group as exemplified by the projects listed at: 

http://geosci.uchicago.edu/~kite/proposals/ 

as well as to mentor undergraduate students.

The University of Chicago hosts a vibrant planets and exoplanets
research program, with particular emphasis on potentially habitable
planets:

-and-exoplanets

Application materials should be received by December 20 for full
consideration. Applicants should send a CV, a brief description of
research interests and experience, and the names of three referees as
a single PDF file to kite@uchicago.edu. Please direct informal
inquiries about this post to Edwin Kite (kite@uchicago.edu).

NASA POSTDOCTORAL FELLOWSHIPS

The NASA Postdoctoral Program (NPP) provides opportunities for 
scientists and engineers to conduct research largely of their own 
choosing, yet compatible with the research opportunities posted on the 
NPP Web site.

Selected by a competitive peer-review process, NPP Fellows complete 
one- to three-year Fellowship appointments that advance NASA's missions 
in earth science, heliophysics, planetary science, astrophysics, space 
bioscience, aeronautics and engineering, human exploration and space 
operations, and astrobiology.

An example of one of the research opportunities in planetary science 
is:

https://www3.orau.gov/NPDoc/Catalog/17613

Applicants must have a Ph.D. or equivalent degree in hand before 
beginning the fellowship, but may apply while completing the degree 
requirements. U. S. citizens, Lawful Permanent Residents, and foreign 
nationals eligible for J-1 status as a Research Scholar may apply.

Stipends start at $53,500 per year, with supplements for high 
cost-of-living areas and for certain academic specialties. Financial 
assistance is available for relocation and health insurance, and $8,000 
per year is provided for professional travel.

Applications are accepted three times each year: March 1, July 1, and 
November 1.

KEY 8TH MARS CONFERENCE PRESENTATIONS NOW AVAILABLE

The Eighth International Conference on Mars at Caltech last July saw 
over 650 "Martians" from 21 countries gathered to discuss the status of 
our exploration of the Red Planet. Three types of summary presentations 
from the conference have been posted on the conference web site: 

http://www.hou.usra.edu/meetings/8thmars2014/presentations/

1. The introductory talks given by the invited speakers of each 
   conference session.
2. Overviews of five upcoming Mars missions. 
3. The Synthesis slides developed during the course of the meeting by 
   the Integration teams, and presented in the concluding session of 
   the Conference.

For #1 and #2 above, 2-page abstracts can be found on the conference 
web site; additionally, full presentations are posted with the 
permission of the speakers. These reference materials provide a good 
snapshot of the state-of-the-art for Mars science as of July 2014. 

We invite you to delve into these resources, and to share this link 
with your colleagues. And we hope you can join us at Ninth Mars, which 
is tentatively scheduled for 2018!
