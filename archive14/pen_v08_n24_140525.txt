BOSTON AAS EVENING SPLINTER MEETING: SCIENCE WITH THE ASTRO-1 SPACE 
TELESCOPE

When: Tuesday, June 3, at 8PM EDT
Where: St. George CD, Westin Copley Place

The BoldlyGo Institute is planning to execute privately funded, 
cutting-edge Discovery-class and Probe-class space science missions 
during the next decade and beyond. One such mission is ASTRO-1, a 2-m 
class space telescope working at UVIS wavelengths to be launched in the 
post-HST era with advanced imaging and spectroscopic capabilities for 
studying galaxy and stellar populations, exoplanetary systems, Solar 
System objects, star formation, the ISM/IGM, time domain astrophysics, 
large-scale structure, and much more. It will be placed into a Lagrange 
point or heliocentric orbit to maximize observing efficiency and to 
allow it to be paired with an external starshade. Join us to learn how 
you can become involved and to help BoldlyGo Institute launch the era 
of NewSpace Science!

NASA POSTDOCTORAL FELLOWSHIPS
 
The NASA Postdoctoral Program (NPP) provides opportunities for 
scientists and engineers to conduct research largely of their own 
choosing, yet compatible with the research opportunities posted on 
the NPP Web site.
 
Selected by a competitive peer-review process, NPP Fellows complete 
one- to three-year Fellowship appointments that advance NASAâ€™s 
missions in earth science, heliophysics, planetary science, 
astrophysics, space bioscience, aeronautics and engineering, human 
exploration and space operations, and astrobiology.
 
An example of one of the research opportunities in planetary science 
is:
 
https://www3.orau.gov/NPDoc/Catalog/18115
 
Applicants must have a Ph.D. or equivalent degree in hand before 
beginning the fellowship, but may apply while completing the degree 
requirements. U. S. citizens, Lawful Permanent Residents, and foreign 
nationals eligible for J-1 status as a Research Scholar may apply.
 
Stipends start at $53,500 per year, with supplements for high cost-of-
living areas and for certain academic specialties. Financial assistance 
is available for relocation and health insurance, and $8,000 per year 
is provided for professional travel.

Applications are accepted three times each year: March 1, July 1, and 
November 1.

JOVIAN MAGNETIC FIELD AND MAGNETOSPHERE POST-DOC RESEARCHER

Applications are now being accepted for a Postdoctoral Research 
Associate, funded through the University of Maryland College Park 
(UMCP) and the Center for Research and Exploration in Space Science 
and Technology (CRESST), to work in the Planetary Magnetospheres 
Laboratory of the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) in the area 
of Jupiter's magnetic field and magnetosphere, using data from the 
Juno (New Frontier) mission. Additional details are available at: 

http://www.astro.umd.edu/employment/#Juno

Candidates for this position should have a Ph.D. in a relevant 
scientific discipline with prior experience conducting scientific 
research. Experience with magnetometer instrumentation and data, 
disciplined programming skills (primarily Fortran and IDL), and 
scientific writing experience are desired.

The University of Maryland is an equal opportunity employer.  All 
applications received by Sept. 26, 2014 will receive full 
consideration.

SPACE POLICY INTERNSHIPS AT THE NRC'S SPACE STUDIES BOARD

Lloyd V. Berkner Space Policy Internships are offered twice annually 
in Washington, D.C., by the National Research Council's Space Studies 
Board. The summer 2014 program is restricted to undergraduates and 
available slots already have been filled. Vacancies still exist in 
the autumn 2014 program, which is open to both undergraduate and 
graduate students. Applications for the autumn program will be 
accepted until June 20, 2014. Successful candidates will be contacted 
by July 17, 2014.  Additional information about the program, including 
application procedure, can be found at:
