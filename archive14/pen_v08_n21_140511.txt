"GEOSPACE REVISITED" THIRD ANNOUNCEMENT AND CALL FOR PAPERS

Geospace Revisited: A Cluster/MAARBLE/Van Allen Probes Conference
Rhodes (Greece), 15-20 September 2014

http://geospacerev.space.noa.gr/

This conference aims at revisiting long-standing issues of geospace 
dynamic phenomena. New data from space missions like Cluster, THEMIS 
and the more recent Van Allen Probes, along with measurements from 
ground-based magnetometer arrays around the globe, processed with new 
methods and combined with theory and simulations are expected to shed 
light on the complex interplay of particles, fields and waves in 
geospace, and in particular the inner magnetosphere (radiation belts 
and ring current). It will be held at the Rodos Palace Hotel: 

http://www.rodos-palace.gr/

Abstract submission is now open until 15 June 2014.

Please note that one has to first register at:

Geomorphology. We warmly welcome abstracts from all branches of 
planetary - and terrestrial - geomorphology. BGS2014 (Sept 12-14, at 
the University of Tennessee-Knoxville) will include a field trip to 
the Appalachian Mts and a workshop on accessing planetary datasets.  

Please see:

http://web.eps.utk.edu/SYMPOSIUM/index.php 

for more information, to register or to submit an abstract 
(before Aug 1). Abstracts will be searchable through the SAO/ADS.

TWO NEW RESOURCE GUIDES FOR THOSE WHO TEACH OR EXPLAIN ASTRONOMY

"Unheard Voices," a set of resource guides about the astronomy of many 
cultures and about the contributions of women to astronomy, is now 
available on the Multiverse web site at:

http://multiverse.ssl.berkeley.edu/Learning-Resources/
Educator-Resource-Guides

The two new resource guides are designed specifically for instructors 
and students in introductory college science courses (such as 
Astro 101), but can be used by anyone who is teaching, explaining, or 
learning astronomy or earth and space science. Sponsored by the 
Heliophysics Forum of the Space Missions Directorate at NASA, the 
guides include written, on-line, and audio-visual materials, many of 
which can be used directly in the classroom, for student papers, or 
personal enrichment.

"Unheard Voices 1: The Astronomy of Many Cultures" features the 
contributions to astronomy of African, Asian, Hispanic, South Pacific, 
Islamic, and Native American cultures, together with a section on 
reports and articles for achieving greater diversity in science.  
(15 pages)

"Unheard Voices 2: Women in Astronomy" features sections on: the 
history of women in astronomy in general, materials on selected women 
astronomers of the past, issues facing women in astronomy today, and 
materials on selected contemporary women astronomers. (13 pages)

ROSETTA/MIDAS POSTDOC POSITION

A three year postdoctoral position is available at the Space Research 
Institute of the Austrian Academy of Science, Graz, Austria, within 
the frame of the ASAP10 project "The MIDAS AFM - modelling and 
calibration of a cometary atomic force microscope".

The successful applicant will join the core MIDAS team which is 
responsible for planning and executing operations of the instrument. 
As well as participating in the ongoing science planning for MIDAS, 
the candidate would combine numerical modelling and analysis of 
scientific data and telemetry to better understand the instrument 
behavior with respect to temperature, vibration and other factors. 
The Flight Spare and Qualification Model instruments are available 
for ground based testing and analysis. Calibration and data 
archiving activities will become important in the latter half of the 
project and it is expected that as operations become more routine, 
time would be available for scientific analysis of the data.

The appointment should start in June 2014 and runs for 36 months; 
the application deadline is 16th May 2014. Both of these can be 
(slightly!) flexible, so please get in touch if you are interested. 
Interested candidates should send their application including a 
short CV to the project leader Dr. Mark Bentley 
(mark.bentley@oeaw.ac.at).

MARS MAGNETIC FIELDS AND UPPER ATMOSPHERE POSTDOCTORAL RESEARCHERS
(NASA-GSFC/CRESST/UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND)

Applications are now being accepted for two Postdoctoral Research
Associates, funded through the University of Maryland College Park 
(UMCP) and the Center for Research and Exploration in Space Science 
and Technology (CRESST), to work in the Planetary Magnetospheres 
Laboratory of the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) in the area 
of Mars magnetic fields and upper atmosphere investigations using data 
from the MAVEN mission. Additional details are available at:

http://www.astro.umd.edu/employment/

Candidates for either position should have a Ph.D. in a relevant
discipline with prior experience conducting scientific research 
related to the Maven science objectives or the types of instruments 
included in the MAVEN science payload. IDL skills and experience in 
acquisition and analysis of data from space flight instruments are 
highly desirable.

The University of Maryland is an equal opportunity employer. All
applications received by May 23, 2014 will receive full consideration.

NASA POSTDOCTORAL FELLOWSHIPS

The NASA Postdoctoral Program (NPP) provides opportunities for 
scientists and engineers to conduct research largely of their own 
choosing, yet compatible with the research opportunities posted on 
the NPP Web site.
 
Selected by a competitive peer-review process, NPP Fellows complete 
one- to three-year Fellowship appointments that advance NASA's 
missions in earth science, heliophysics, planetary science, 
astrophysics, space bioscience, aeronautics and engineering, human 
exploration and space operations, and astrobiology.

A sample research opportunity is:

https://www3.orau.gov/NPDoc/Catalog/18360  

Applicants must have a Ph.D. or equivalent degree in hand before 
beginning the fellowship, but may apply while completing the degree 
requirements. U. S. citizens, Lawful Permanent Residents, and foreign 
nationals eligible for J-1 status as a Research Scholar may apply.

Stipends start at $53,500 per year, with supplements for high cost-
of-living areas and for certain academic specialties. Financial 
assistance is available for relocation and health insurance, and 
$8,000 per year is provided for professional travel.

Applications are accepted three times each year: March 1, July 1, 
and November 1.

SPECIAL REGIONS SAG REPORT: PRESENTATION AT MEPAG MEETING NEXT WEEK

To Members of the Mars Exploration Community,

One of the major presentations at the MEPAG meeting next week will be 
the draft analysis prepared by the Special Regions SAG. This committee 
has been working for approximately the last 5 months to update our 
technical understanding of when and where planetary protection special 
regions might occur on Mars. The SAG has produced a draft report for 
community review, discussion, and feedback. A set of PPT-formatted 
files summarizing their preliminary findings has now been posted on 
the MEPAG website at the following location: 

http://mepag.jpl.nasa.gov/meetings.cfm?expand=m29 

The SAG committee would welcome any feedback on this interim material 
before it proceeds to preparation of a text-formatted final report.

these topics with this symposium!

We welcome the presentations on the following topics:
* Results from Hayabusa sample analysis
* New insights from solar system material analysis
* Spectroscopy and planetary surface processes
* Perspectives of solar system evolution by theoretical, observational 
  and experimental studies
* Technique and methodology of sample analysis
* Other related studies

[NASA] ROSES-14: REMOVING PLANETARY MAJOR EQUIPMENT FROM PDART

ROSES-14 Amendment 19 removes the Planetary Major Equipment option 
from Appendix C.7, Planetary Data Archiving, Restoration, and Tools 
Program (PDART)

The Planetary Data Archiving, Restoration, and Tools (PDART) Program 
solicits proposals to generate higher-order data products, archive 
and restore data sets or products, create or consolidate reference 
databases, digitize data, and develop or validate software tools.

The objective of this program element is to increase the amount and 
quality of archived data and data products available for planetary 
science research and exploration and to produce tools that would 
enable or enhance future scientific investigations. 

This amendment removes the Planetary Major Equipment option from 
the Planetary Data Archiving, Restoration, and Tools call, C.7. The 
due dates remain unchanged, Step-1 proposals are due July 14, 2014, 
and Step-2 proposals are due September 12, 2014.

Amendment: NNH14ZDA001N
