SUMMER COURSE "LIFE ON EARTH AND BEYOND - THE HISTORY AND PHILOSOPHY 
OF THE ORIGIN OF LIFE"

Island of Ven, 4 - 6 May 2015

The aim of the course is to give participants an overview of the 
historical, philosophical and ethical questions arising in this field. 
It is co-organized by the Nordic Network of Astrobiology and the EU 
COST Action "Origins and Evolution of Life on Earth and in the 
Universe". The course is open for students and scientists in 
humanities, natural, social and political sciences. Some of the 
following course themes are: 

- Definition of life in a historical and philosophical context
- Biochemical evolution
- The tree of biological evolution
- Search for life outside Earth
- Philosophical, ethical and political questions arising with the quest 
  for life on other celestial bodies

A multitude of highly merited researchers have agreed to teach at the 
course.  For details see: 

http://www.nordicastrobiology.net/Ven2015/

The deadline for application is 15 January 2015 23:59:00 UTC.

20-20-20 AIRSHIPS NASA CENTENNIAL CHALLENGE RFI

A challenge is being developed to incentivize airships, lighter than 
air maneuverable vehicles, as a possible platform for astronomy and 
Earth Science as part of the NASA Centennial Challenge Program 
(www.centennialchallenges.nasa.gov). Recently a request for information 
(RFI) about this Challenge has been released.
 
The RFI is posted here: 

http://go.usa.gov/7hfS
 
If the proposed Airships 20-20-20 Challenge is selected to proceed, 
there will be a 2 stage challenge, first to build an airship that 
flies with a small (20kg) payload for 20 hours at 20km, and in the 
second stage a 200kg payload for 200 hours at 20km. 
 
One of the criteria NASA will use in deciding whether to proceed with 
the Challenge will be interest among the science community and 
potential end users in industry. This includes interest both in 
participating in the Challenge and in seeing stratospheric airships 
as a viable platform. Section 6 of the RFI lists some questions that 
are of particular interest to scientists who might use this platform 
in the future.
 
Comments must be submitted no later than 5 p.m. Eastern Time on 
December 1, 2014 to Mr. Sam Ortega at: 
HQ-STMD-CentennialChallenges@mail.nasa.gov. 
Use 202020 Challenge on the Subject line.

SECOND LANDING SITE WORKSHOP FOR THE MARS 2020 ROVER 
 
You are invited to participate in the second landing site workshop for 
the Mars 2020 Rover. The workshop will be held in the Pasadena, CA, 
area on August 4-6, 2015 (venue TBD) and will focus on further 
evaluation of candidate sites introduced at the first workshop as well 
as new candidate sites. Additional information will be posted on the 
Mars 2020 landing site website:

http://marsnext.jpl.nasa.gov
  
The candidate landing sites emerging from the second workshop will then 
be considered in more detail by the 2020 Project, Mars Program, and the 
Science Community. New sites may be proposed and discussed at the 
workshop, with the expectation that such new sites will be based in 
part on discoveries related to new data from MRO. Future workshops 
(beyond 2015) would further narrow the list of sites under 
consideration to a recommended landing site zone and (eventually) 
precise landing ellipse.
  
All members of the scientific community are encouraged to participate 
in this activity, as robust input from the science community is 
critical to identifying the optimal landing site for the 2020 rover.

Paper Submission Opportunity I

The year 2014 marks the tenth year of operations of the NASA/ESA 
Cassini orbiter at Saturn, a period which has seen a tremendous 
increase in our knowledge of the planet’s ring system. As a result, 
previous theoretical models have been challenged or revised, and many 
new questions raised. In August 2014, the Fourth Planetary Rings 
Workshop was held in Boulder, CO, sponsored by the Cassini Rings 
Working Group. This special issue brings together papers presented at 
the meeting, but is also open to other contributions describing new 
observational or theoretical work on this topic.
Topics of interest include:

- New observations or analyses of data for Saturn’s rings from 
  Cassini, or ground-based observations.
- New results on the ring systems of other bodies, including 
  Jupiter, Uranus, and Neptune.
- Theoretical analyses or numerical modeling of any aspect of 
  planetary rings systems.

Submission Format:
Submitted papers must be written in English and describe original 
research which is neither published nor currently under review by other 
journals.  Author guidelines for preparation of manuscripts can be 
found at:

Paper Submission Opportunity II

As Titan approaches northern summer solstice in 2017, seasonal 
variations in solar insolation are driving dynamic changes to its 
surface and atmosphere. A primary objective of the Cassini Solstice 
Mission is to study these changes and monitor the evolution of Titan’s 
hydrocarbon-based hydrologic cycle. Titan’s exotic environment 
ensures that even rudimentary measurements of atmospheric/surface 
interactions, such as wind-wave generation or aeolian dune development, 
provide valuable data to anchor physical models.

Titan’s seas are being illuminated for the first time during the 
Cassini mission. This special issue invites papers that describe 
observations, theoretical models, and laboratory experiments that 
relate to the processes that modify Titan’s surface and drive its 
atmosphere.

Topics of interest include:
- New results documenting surface and atmospheric processes on Titan 
  from both the Cassini mission and telescopic observations.
- Theoretical modeling predicting activity on Titan’s surface and 
  within its atmosphere.
- Laboratory investigations into the underlying processes related to 
  activity on Titan.
