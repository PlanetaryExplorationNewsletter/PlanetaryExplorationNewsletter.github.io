EDITORIAL: THE FUTURE OF ARM

Richard P. Binzel
Professor of Planetary Science
Massachusetts Institute of Technology

The Asteroid Retrieval Mission (ARM) continued to raise concern last 
week at both the Small Bodies Assessment Group (SBAG) and NASA Advisory 
Council (NAC) meetings. Several accounts are available at:

For balance, the challenges and potential exploration advancements of 
ARM are in the SBAG presentations at:

http://www.lpi.usra.edu/sbag/meetings/jul2014/agenda.shtml

SBAG will be issuing its draft findings soon for public comment. These 
findings will have particular impact on planetary exploration as House 
Resolution 4412 specifically calls for SBAG's assessment of ARM as it 
considers whether to legislate ongoing funding. Neither the cost to 
NASA as an agency nor the cost to planetary science has been 
determined.

I hope every member of the community with an opinion about ARM and its 
potential impact on planetary exploration will exercise their right to
convey it either through the SBAG process or by otherwise reaching out 
to a member of the SBAG Steering Committee: 

http://www.lpi.usra.edu/sbag/committee/

Some people may have felt discouraged from publicly voicing their 
opinions. Government employees, or anyone feeling constrained, should 
use private email accounts and phone lines. We are all entitled to 
express our viewpoints.

AGU SESSION - THE RITE OF SPRING: THE CHANGING SEASONS ON TITAN

Intense scrutiny by the Cassini Saturn Orbiter, combined with extensive 
ground based observing campaigns, has established Titan's seasonal 
weather pattern over more than a third of a Saturn orbital period. Many 
of the changes seen in the atmosphere are associated with changes on 
the surface. These changes are the product of atmospheric processes 
such as evaporation, rainfall and/or infiltration and fluvial activity 
most probably in combination with dynamic processes ongoing in Titan's 
interior. The relative contribution of each of these processes to 
Titan's state at a given point in time is gradually being understood. 
The session will present recent spacecraft and ground-based results and 
test the veracity of the current models.

AGU SESSION U018 - UPSTAIRS DOWNSTAIRS: CONSEQUENCES OF INTERNAL 
EVOLUTION FOR THE HABITABILITY OF PLANETARY SURFACES

The chemistry and physics of planetary interiors shapes and is shaped 
by conditions at their surfaces. The nature and extent of these 
interactions are not well understood. For example, in Earth history, 
the transition from a reduced to an oxidizing surface environment 
after 2.4 Ga, which paved the way for complex life, may have been 
modulated by changes in the redox state of mantle-derived gases. On 
Earth-like exoplanets, variations in planetary mass and composition 
affect the prospects for life, and for its detectability, in ways that 
have barely been considered. This session seeks to bring together 
geochemists, geophysicists, geobiologists, and others who are building 
knowledge about the complex relationships between the surface 
habitability and internal evolution of Earth and Earth-like worlds.

AGU SESSION V007 - ACCRETIONARY AND PLANETARY DIFFERENTIATION PROCESSES 
AS RECORDED IN EARLY EARTH AND PLANETARY MATERIALS
 
This session (V007 ID#1785) invites contributions based on geophysical 
models and geochemical records in terrestrial and planetary materials 
that will increase our understanding of early Earth and planetary 
evolution. We encourage contributions on topics such as: constraints 
on the nature of building blocks of terrestrial planets; timing and 
nature of early differentiation of the silicate Earth; consequences of 
Moon formation and late accretion for the development of the major 
terrestrial and lunar reservoirs; processes and timescales for the 
generation and survival of mantle heterogeneities; and implications of 
the composition of planetary materials for models of the chemical 
evolution of the Earth.

Everyone is permitted an additional E/PO abstract that does not count 
against your science abstract limit. Consider submitting to the four 
highlighted sessions below:

* Educator Professional Development Programs Promoting Authentic 
Scientific Research. Presentations are welcome from educators and 
scientists, and those who design, facilitate, evaluate or fund such 
programs.

Success for Teaching Students. We invite scientists, engineers, and 
E/PO professionals to share tools, resources, and examples of 
successful projects that supports students' understandings aligned 
with the Next Generation Science Standards.

* Scientist Engagement in Education and Public Outreach: Sharing 
Effective Tools, Resources, and Stories of Success. We invite 
presenters to share tools, resources and stories of success that

PLANETARY ANALOGUES TOWN HALL MEETING AT EPSC 2014, CASCAIS, PORTUGAL

An Analogs Town Hall is planned for Tuesday, 9 September from 9:00 to 
12:30 in the Mars Room. This is intended for members of the analogs 
community - principal investigators, scientists, engineers, mission 
managers - who wish to discuss recent analog activities over the past 
five years on a global scale, and propose new concepts for research 
projects and missions in support of future Solar System exploration. 
This will be a forum for discussion between the participants and 
invited speakers regarding recent and ongoing activities conducted by 
the speaker's home space agency. These include but are not restricted 
to: space exploration analog project goals, results, and lessons 
learned; how analog project results are communicated; how analog 
missions could be expanded in future to more closely match space 
missions; and how all these activities could become more visible to the 
global space exploration community.

NASA POSTDOCTORAL FELLOWSHIPS

The NASA Postdoctoral Program (NPP) provides opportunities for 
scientists and engineers to conduct research largely of their own 
choosing, yet compatible with the research opportunities posted on 
the NPP Web site.

Selected by a competitive peer-review process, NPP Fellows complete 
one- to three-year Fellowship appointments that advance NASA's missions 
in earth science, heliophysics, planetary science, astrophysics, space 
bioscience, aeronautics and engineering, human exploration and space 
operations, and astrobiology.

An example of one of the research opportunities in planetary science 
is:

https://www3.orau.gov/NPDoc/Catalog/18395

Applicants must have a Ph.D. or equivalent degree in hand before 
beginning the fellowship, but may apply while completing the degree 
requirements. U.S. citizens, Lawful Permanent Residents, and foreign 
nationals eligible for J-1 status as a Research Scholar may apply.

Stipends start at $53,500 per year, with supplements for high 
cost-of-living areas and for certain academic specialties. Financial 
assistance is available for relocation and health insurance, and 
$8,000 per year is provided for professional travel.

Applications are accepted three times each year: March 1, July 1, 
and November 1.

SPITZER SPACE TELESCOPE CYCLE-11 CALL FOR PROPOSALS

http://ssc.spitzer.caltech.edu/warmmission/propkit/cp/cp11.pdf

Large & Exploration Science Letters of Intent Due:
Thursday, 28 August 2014

Proposal Deadline:
Wednesday, 29 October 2014, 4:00 PM PDT

Cycle-11 programs will execute in the February 2015 - September 2016 
timeframe. We expect to select 6,700 - 9,200 hours of scheduling 
priority 1 programs and 1,000 hours of priority 2 snapshot programs.

Priority in the selection of Cycle-11 will be given to programs that
highlight

- Astro2010 science themes
- Planetary science programs observing targets in our Solar System.
- Investigations that concentrate on developing the scientific 
  landscape that JWST will explore, or will help maximize the JWST 
  scientific return.

In this cycle proposers are especially encouraged to consider 
compelling planetary science campaigns (long-term/multiple 
observations) that focus on the changing nature of solar system 
objects over time. Many of these objects are possible future mission 
targets as outlined in the most recent planetary decadal survey. 
Proposers should identify how these observations contribute to the 
body of scientific knowledge needed to help refine objectives for 
future missions and aid in the understanding of the origin or 
evolution of the targeted body.
