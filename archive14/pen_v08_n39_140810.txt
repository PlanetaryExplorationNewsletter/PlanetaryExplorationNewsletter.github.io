[NASA] CORRECTION FOR DUE DATE - SOLAR IRRADIANCE SCIENCE

The proposal due date for ROSES-2014 A.16, Solar Irradiance Science 
Team is Monday, November 3, 2014.
 
Although the NSPIRES web pages displayed the correct due date for 
proposals to ROSES-2014 A.16, the Solar Irradiance Science Team 
(SIST), the NSPIRES E-mail announcing release of the call had the 
wrong due date. Please note that the proposal due date for ROSES-2014 
A.16, Solar Irradiance Science Team is Monday, November 3, 2014.

Questions concerning A.16, SIST should be directed to David B. 
Considine at david.b.considine@nasa.gov or 202-358-2277.

[NASA] CLARIFICATION OF C.20 DAWN AT CERES GUEST INVESTIGATOR 
PROGRAM

The text of C.20 the Dawn at Ceres Guest Investigator Program was 
clarified on August 6, 2014 to provide explicit instructions for 
foreign investigators in Section 2.1 and to clarify the requirement in 
Section 2.2 that all data presented in the proposal must be in the 
public domain. The proposal due dates remain unchanged. Step-1 
proposals are due Thursday, 08/14/2014 and Step-2 proposals are due 
10/09/2014.
 
Questions regarding C.20 or this clarification may be directed to 
Michael Kelley at michael.s.kelley@nasa.gov and Michael New at 
michael.h.new@nasa.gov.

[NASA] PDS - LUNAR RECONNAISSANCE ORBITHER MINI-RF BISTATIC RADAR
DATA RELEASE 2

The NASA Planetary Data System announces the second release of Mini-RF 
Bistatic Radar observations from the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) 
mission, covering data acquired on August 7, 2012, October 2, 2012, and 
October 30, 2012 (orbits 14303, 14977, and 15317). To access the above 
data, please visit the following link:

http://pds.nasa.gov/subscription_service/SS-20140805.html

PDS offers two services for searching the LRO archives:

1. The Planetary Image Atlas at the Imaging Node allows selection of 
LRO data by specific search criteria:   

http://pds-imaging.jpl.nasa.gov/search/lro/

2. The Lunar Orbital Data Explorer at the Geosciences Node allows 
searching and downloading of LRO data and other lunar orbital data 
sets (Clementine and Lunar Prospector):

"ASTRONOMY AMBASSADORS" OUTREACH WORKSHOP AT THE TUCSON DPS MEETING

Introduction to Outreach for Early Career Planetary Scientists:
Sunday, 9 November, JW Marriot Starr Pass, Tucson
  
We invite graduate students, post-docs, and early-career faculty or 
research scientists to a day-long workshop providing training and 
resources for effective outreach to K-12 teachers and students, 
families, and the public. The workshop will take place on the Sunday 
preceding the annual Division for Planetary Sciences meeting. 
Participants will be introduced to discussion and questioning 
strategies, ways to avoid technical jargon, specific hands-on
activities usable in a variety of settings, and ways of finding 
outreach partners in their own communities. They will also learn about 
and receive a set of written and electronic resources, including The 
Universe at Your Fingertips 2.0 (featuring 133 classroom tested 
astronomy activities) and The MOOSE (“Menu of Outreach Opportunities 
for Science Education” covering existing astronomy outreach programs, 
etc.)

The number of participants is limited. To apply, register for the DPS 
meeting and complete the application: 

http://aas.org/content/dps-46-astronomy-ambassadors-workshop
-application

Applications are due by August 27. We especially encourage 
applications from groups that are under-represented in science and 
those who are new to outreach. See:

THE ASTROBIOLOGY SCIENCE CONFERENCE 2015

The Astrobiology Science Conference 2015 will be held at the Hilton 
Chicago in downtown Chicago, Illinois, on June 15–19, 2015. See:

http://www.hou.usra.edu/meetings/abscicon2015/

AbSciCon2015 is the next in a series of conferences organized by the 
astrobiology community. The conference will convene scientists from all 
over the world who work in the interdisciplinary field of astrobiology 
— the study of the origin, evolution, distribution, and future of life 
in the universe — to report on research findings and plan future 
endeavors. The theme for AbSciCon2015 is "Habitability, Habitable 
Worlds, and Life." 
 
Astrobiology is an inherently interdisciplinary endeavor. Given the 
wide variety of disciplinary tools and topics to be presented at the 
conference, the success of AbSciCon2015 will be built upon the 
community's involvement in the organization of topical sessions. 
Community members are urged to be proactive in proposing sessions, 
merging similar session topics, and organizing abstracts into selected 
sessions. The Call for Session Topics and Organizers will open 
September 2, 2014:

http://www.hou.usra.edu/meetings/abscicon2015/program/topics/

The deadline to submit Session Topics is October 22, 2014. Contact 
meetinginfo@hou.usra.edu for more information.

one- to three-year Fellowship appointments that advance NASA's missions 
in earth science, heliophysics, planetary science, astrophysics, space 
bioscience, aeronautics and engineering, human exploration and space 
operations, and astrobiology.
 
An example of one of the research opportunities in planetary science 
is:
 
https://www3.orau.gov/NPDoc/Catalog/17605
