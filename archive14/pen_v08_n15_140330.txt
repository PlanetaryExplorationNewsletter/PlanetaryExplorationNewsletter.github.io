UPDATED RESOURCE GUIDE TO SCIENCE FICTION WITH GOOD ASTRONOMY ON THE 
ASP WEBSITE

A revised and updated resource guide to science fiction stories with 
good astronomy and physics is now available at the educational 
website of the non-profit Astronomical Society of the Pacific: 

http://www.astrosociety.org/education/resources/scifi.html

This edition of the guide includes over 270 stories organized into 
more than 40 topical categories. For the first time, it gives the 
URLs for a number of stories that are available free on the Web. 
All the listed stories could be used for class supplements or 
recommending to interested audiences.

STUDENT OPPORTUNITY: DEADLINE FOR APPLICATIONS FOR BARRINGER FAMILY 
FUND FOR METEORITE IMPACT RESEARCH
 
A reminder:
 
Applications for the Barringer Family Fund for Meteorite Impact 
Research are due April 4, 2014.
 
The Barringer Family Fund for Meteorite Impact Research will provide 
a small number (3 to 5) of competitive grants each year in the range 
of $2,500 to $5,000 USD for support of field research at known or 
suspected impact sites worldwide. Grant funds may be used to assist 
with travel and subsistence costs, as well as laboratory and 
computer analysis of research samples and findings. Masters, 
doctoral, and post-doctoral students enrolled in formal university 
programs are eligible. Other details about the award as well as an 
application form for interested students can be found at:

POST-DOCTORAL AND POST-GRADUATE OPPORTUNITIES IN SWITZERLAND

As part of its long-term strategic interest in exoplanet science, 
the government of Switzerland has awarded funding to a network of 
universities and research groups to create a Swiss-wide research 
framework known as "PlanetS". The new programme has a large number 
of Post-Doctoral and Post-Graduate positions available at several 
institutes from 1 June 2014 in both exoplanet and Solar System 
research.

A draft of the advertisement is now on-line at:

PLANETARY HABITABILITY AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO

New research group starting Jan 2015 - Opportunities

http://geosci.uchicago.edu/~kite/opportunities/

Research will be directed towards understanding the processes that
sustain habitable planets. Areas of particular interest are: 

Early Mars - geologic proxies for paleoclimate (geology, stratigraphy,
paleohydrology, geomorphology), climate modeling; rocky exoplanets;
and Europa and Enceladus.

Funding has been secured to hire a planetary GIS / data specialist,
one or more postdocs, and graduate students. For more information,
please email Edwin Kite (PI), kite@uchicago.edu.

More details about the planetary GIS / data specialist position are
posted at:

https://jobopportunities.uchicago.edu 

(Requisition Number: 094770)
Prospective graduate students should apply through the Department 
of Geophysical Sciences at the University of Chicago.

Existing planetary science research at the University of Chicago
includes the Abbot group (climate theory), the Bean group (exoplanet
observations), the Campbell group (planetary interiors), the Ciesla
group (formation and early evolution of planetary systems), the
Dauphas group (origins/cosmochemistry), the Davis group (stardust),
the Fabrycky group (orbital dynamics, planet formation and dynamical
evolution), the Grossman group (cosmochemistry), the Konigl group
(exoplanets), and the Pierrehumbert group (physics of planetary
climate).

[NASA] DUE DATE CLARIFICATION FOR EXOBIOLOGY AND MATISSE

In February most of the Planetary Science ROSES calls had bold notices 
added to the top reminding proposers that proposals would be submitted 
via the two step process. Sadly, two of these contained errors. 
The bold notice statement at the top of C.5 Exobiology and C.13,
MatISSE gave erroneous due dates, although Tables 2 and 3 were 
always correct. The dates given in the bold notices at the top of 
C.5 and C.13 have been corrected to match the due dates given in 
Tables 2 and 3.

2014 NASA PLANETARY SCIENCE SUMMER SCHOOL APPLICATIONS OPEN

NASA is accepting applications from science and engineering post-docs, 
recent PhDs, and doctoral students for its 26th Annual Planetary 
Science Summer School, which will be held in three separate sessions 
in summer 2014 (June 16-20, July 14-18, and August 11-15) at the Jet 
Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif.  

During the program and pre-session webinars, student teams will carry 
out the equivalent of an early mission concept study, prepare a 
proposal authorization review presentation, present it to a review 
board, and receive feedback. By the end of the session, students will 
have a clearer understanding of the life cycle of a space mission; 
relationships between mission design, cost, and schedule; and the 
tradeoffs necessary to stay within cost and schedule while preserving 
the quality of science. The 2014 sessions will address planetary 
exploration missions needing power system trade-offs, including the 
use of solar electric vs. Multi-mission Radioisotope Thermoelectric 
Generators (MMRTG). The session in August will have a targeted focus 
on spacecraft power systems.

Applications are due April 1, 2014. Partial financial support is 
available for a limited number of individuals. Further information 
is available at:

POSTDOCTORAL FELLOW AT NAVAL RESEARCH LABORATORY

A postdoctoral fellowship position supported by the RIS4E team of 
NASA's Solar System Exploration Virtual Institute is available now 
at the Naval Research Laboratory in Washington, DC, for the study 
of the mineralogy and petrology of meteorites and returned samples. 
The successful candidate will use transmission electron microscopy 
(TEM) and electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) for mineralogical 
studies, including oxidation state analysis. The postdoc will 
coordinate the TEM studies with synchrotron-based studies conducted by 
team members at the partnering RIS4E institutions, for the analysis of 
analog materials, meteorites and returned lunar, Stardust and/or 
Hayabusa samples. Expertise in transmission electron microscopy is 
required, and familiarity with EELS and advanced sample preparation 
methods is preferred. Instrumentation at NRL for these studies 
includes a Nion UltraSTEM 200 (to be delivered June 2014), and a JEOL 
2200FS. The salary for this position is set at the NRL/NRC/ASEE 
fellow rate of $74,872. Interested candidates may send inquiries to 
rhonda.stroud@nrl.navy.mil. Please include a CV and publication list. 
Due to security regulations at NRL, this position requires US 
citizenship or permanent residency.

NASA POSTDOCTORAL FELLOWSHIPS

The NASA Postdoctoral Program (NPP) provides opportunities for 
scientists and engineers to conduct research largely of their own 
choosing, yet compatible with the research opportunities posted on 
the NPP Web site.

Selected by a competitive peer-review process, NPP Fellows complete 
one- to three-year Fellowship appointments that advance NASA's missions 
in earth science, heliophysics, planetary science, astrophysics, space 
bioscience, aeronautics and engineering, human exploration and space 
operations, and astrobiology.

A sample research opportunity is:

https://www3.orau.gov/NPDoc/Catalog/17721

Applicants must have a Ph.D. or equivalent degree in hand before 
beginning the fellowship, but may apply while completing the degree 
requirements. U. S. citizens, Lawful Permanent Residents, and foreign 
nationals eligible for J-1 status as a Research Scholar may apply.

Stipends start at $53,500 per year, with supplements for high cost-
of-living areas and for certain academic specialties. Financial 
assistance is available for relocation and health insurance, and 
$8,000 per year is provided for professional travel.

Applications are accepted three times each year: March 1, July 1, 
and November 1.
