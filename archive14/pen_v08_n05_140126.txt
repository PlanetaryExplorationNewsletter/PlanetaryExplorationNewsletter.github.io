WORKSHOP ON THE HABITABILITY OF ICY WORLDS

February 5-7, 2014, Pasadena, Calif.

The Workshop on the Habitability of Icy Worlds is fast approaching. 
The primary objective of this workshop will be to focus on the 
astrobiological potential of icy worlds in the outer solar system-
including Europa, Ganymede, Enceladus, Titan and beyond-with 
discussion on future research directions and spacecraft missions 
that can best assess that potential. The workshop agenda is divided 
into thematic sessions on: water and exotic solvents; chemical 
energy for life; organics and their detection; ocean physics and 
chemistry; icy world activity and habitability over time; and 
continuing and future outer solar system exploration. Full details 
of the science program can be found at:

CALL FOR ABSTRACTS FOR THE SELENE SYMPOSIUM 2014 HELD IN JAPAN 
MARCH 4 AND 5

International Symposium of Lunar Science and Exploration using data 
from Multi-Instruments

Significant progress in lunar science and technology has been made 
in the last decade by orbiter missions including SELENE (Kaguya). 
It is time to start new analyses, for instance using data from 
multi-instruments and/or lunar samples.

For this purpose, we held an international symposium of lunar science, 
the SELENE SYMPOSIUM 2013, at Institute of Space and Astronautical 
Science (ISAS), Sagamihara, Japan, last January. The Symposium 
was very fruitful with more than 90 participants from 7 countries.

Here, we are pleased to announce the 2nd symposium, the SELENE 
SYMPOSIUM 2014, in Japan, again. The meeting place will be at National 
Astronomical Observatory of Japan (NAOJ), Mitaka city, Tokyo. All 
scientists and engineers around the world who are interested in lunar 
science are invited to come together for beneficial discussions on the 
new views of the origin and evolution of the Moon. Presentation topics 
will be widely opened.

NASA POSTDOCTORAL FELLOWSHIPS

The NASA Postdoctoral Program (NPP) provides opportunities for 
scientists and engineers to conduct research largely of their own 
choosing, yet compatible with the research opportunities posted on 
the NPP Web site.

Selected by a competitive peer-review process, NPP Fellows complete 
one- to three-year Fellowship appointments that advance NASA's 
missions in earth science, heliophysics, planetary science, 
astrophysics, space bioscience, aeronautics and engineering, human 
exploration and space operations, and astrobiology.

An sample research opportunity is:

https://www3.orau.gov/NPDoc/Catalog/18709

Applicants must have a Ph.D. or equivalent degree in hand before 
beginning the fellowship, but may apply while completing the degree 
requirements. U. S. citizens, Lawful Permanent Residents, and foreign 
nationals eligible for J-1 status as a Research Scholar may apply.

Stipends start at $53,500 per year, with supplements for high cost-
of-living areas and for certain academic specialties. Financial 
assistance is available for relocation and health insurance, and 
$8,000 per year is provided for professional travel.

CALL FOR PAPERS: AOGS PS03 - OUTER SOLAR SYSTEM SATELLITES WITH AN 
ATMOSPHERE

http://www.asiaoceania.org/aogs2014/mars2/confSessionView.asp?sID=105

This session welcomes papers about the outer planets satellites with
atmospheres, with special emphasis on observations (both from space 
and from the ground), modeling, and theoretical interpretation, with 
emphasis on the moons that are geologically active, show time variable 
properties, and have a tenuous or thick gaseous environments or plumes 
(Titan, Enceladus, Io, Europa, Ganymede, Callisto, Triton). We would 
also like to have presentations on the habitability potential of such 
environments. In addition, abstracts on satellite interactions with 
their neutral environments, supporting laboratory investigations and 
concepts for future spacecraft missions and investigations are also 
relevant to this session. Other work on icy satellites can be included 
in another PS Session.

http://www.asiaoceania.org/aogs2014/mars2/convenerSessionView.
asp?sID=110

It's time to celebrate the scientific returns and achievements of 
the Cassini international mission to Titan and the Saturnian system. 
Additionally, the New Horizons spacecraft will reach Pluto in July 
2015. The JUNO spacecraft is on its way to Jupiter. New plans are 
being developed for a 2020's Uranus Orbiter with Probe mission. The 
JUICE mission is in up-swing for launch in 2025. Following the 
successful lunar missions of Japan, China and India, planetary 
scientists in Asia may soon join forces with international colleagues 
in exploring the outer solar system. Thus it is timely to review 
significant scientific achievements in the areas of planetary and 
satellite atmospheres, magnetospheres, icy moons and the rings, 
including prior and anticipated observations of other outer planets 
and moons, and theoretical modeling of planetary phenomena. Because 
of tremendous advances made in the study of extrasolar giant planets, 
we solicit also abstracts on related topics - with a view to promote 
interdisciplinary dialogs among scientists and astrophysicists.

JWST SOLAR SYSTEM FOCUS GROUPS

The JWST Solar System Working Group is looking for participants in 
Focus Groups to develop case studies for observations with JWST and 
help guide the project on specific needs or capabilities necessary 
for enabling their science. The project is actively developing and 
implementing the observatory capabilities and will finalize these in 
the next few years. Focus Group findings will be reported in the 
form of a white paper and/or publication and will:

(1) describe specific scientific questions 
(2) provide observation scenarios and data products needed 
(3) evaluate JWST instruments and observatory performance 
(sensitivity, field of view, etc) and 
(4) provide the project with key concerns regarding capabilities 
that may not be currently offered.  

Subgroups and contacts so far include: 
Asteroids (A. Rivkin, JHU/APL)
NEOs (C. Thomas, NASA GSFC/ORAU) 
Comets (C. Woodward, U. Minnesota)
