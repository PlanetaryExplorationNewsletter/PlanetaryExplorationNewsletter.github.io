[NASA] EMERGING WORLDS DUE DATE DELAYED TO JUNE 4, 2014

The due date for Step-2 proposals to C.2 Emerging Worlds has been 
delayed to Wednesday, June 4, 2014, because of the San Diego County 
wildfires.
 
The Emerging Worlds program solicits research proposals to conduct 
scientific investigations related to understanding the formation and 
early evolution of our Solar System. It covers the physics and 
chemistry of events and materials that are relevant to the formation 
of planets, satellites, and minor bodies, including dust, and to the 
early history of these bodies.
 
Questions concerning C.2 Emerging Worlds may be directed to:

REVIEWERS FOR PLANETARY PROPOSALS CAN NOW BE RECOMMENDED

A website has been set up at:

http://science.nasa.gov/researchers/suggested-reviewers
/roses-planetary-science-proposals/

where you can recommend unconflicted reviewers for your proposals.
This was successfully piloted by NASA Heliophysics and is now being 
extended to the NASA Planetary Science Division research programs.

On this page, you identify yourself, the ROSES program to which you 
are applying, and your proposal submission number. You may then submit 
the names and email addresses of unconflicted individuals who are 
subject matter experts in areas covered by your proposal.

There is also a box for additional comments in which you can note the 
names of individuals whom you feel should not be allowed to review your 
proposal. Rationales can also be included.

This information is then forwarded to the appropriate program officer
for their use in creating review panels and identifying potential 
external reviewers.

There is no guarantee that your input will be followed. However, such 
input is extremely useful for program officers as they construct review 
panels and identify external reviewers for programs.

It is strongly suggested that everyone make use of this opportunity.

Please send any comments/suggestions on this site to:
