[NASA] DELAY OF STEP-2 PROPOSAL DUE DATE FOR DAWN AT CERES GUEST INVESTIGATOR
PROGRAM

ROSES-14 Amendment 34

To allow proposers adequate time to prepare their full Step-2 proposals 
after hearing the decision about their Step-1 proposals, the due date 
for Step-2 proposals for this program is now October 27, 2014.

This Amendment to the NASA Research Announcement "Research 
Opportunities in Space and Earth Sciences (ROSES)-2014" (NNH14ZDA001N) 
is posted on the NASA research opportunity homepage at: 

http://nspires.nasaprs.com/ 

and will appear on the RSS feed at: 

http://nasascience.nasa.gov/researchers/sara/grant-solicitations/
roses-2014

Only offerors who submitted a Step-1 proposal are now eligible to 
submit a Step-2 (full) proposal. Potential proposers are strongly 
encouraged to carefully read Section 2.3 of C.20 and the "Instructions 
for Submitting a Step-2 Proposal" under "Other Documents" on the 
NSPIRES web page for this program.

Questions concerning this program element or this Amendment may be 
directed to: Michael New at  michael.h.new@nasa.gov.

[NASA] EXPLORER SOLICITATIONS ARE RELEASED

Notice of Intent to Propose Due: October 15, 2014
Proposals Due: December 18, 2014
 
NASA has released the Announcement of Opportunity for each of the 3 
following missions:

1. NNH14ZDA013O (Small Explorer AO)
2. NNH12ZDA006O-APEXMO2  (Amendment 9 to the SALMON-2 AO: 
   Astrophysics Explorer Mission of Opportunity Solicitation)
3. NNH14ZDA001N-APEX USPI  (Amendment 33 to the ROSES-14 NRA: 
   Astrophysics Explorer U.S. Participating Investigators)

The full text of the solicitations and all appendices will be 
available electronically at: 

http://nspires.nasaprs.com/
 
Pre-proposal conferences will be held in early October 2014. For
details see:

http://explorers.larc.nasa.gov/APSMEX 
 
NASA expects to select up to three Astrophysics Small Explorer 
missions for Phase A studies, and down-select one to proceed into 
Phase B and subsequent mission phases. NASA expects to select up to 
three Astrophysics Explorer Missions of Opportunity for Phase A 
studies, and down-select one or two to proceed into Phase B and 
subsequent mission phases. If multiple selectable Missions of 
Opportunity are proposed with combined costs within the available 
funding, NASA may down-select more than one Mission of Opportunity 
investigation. NASA expects to select up to two USPI investigations.
  
Comments and questions may be addressed in writing or by E-mail to:

Dr. Wilton T. Sanders, NASA Headquarters

[NASA] PDS - LADEE LDEX EXTENDED MISSION DATA RELEASE

The Planetary Data System (PDS) is pleased to announce the 
availability of the LADEE Lunar Dust Experiment (LDEX) reduced and 
calibrated data from the extended mission. The data from the nominal 
mission was previously released, so now all reduced and calibrated 
LDEX data from the full mission are available from the PDS. These 
data are certified for use in proposals.

To access the LADEE LDEX data, please visit the following link:

NASA POSTDOCTORAL FELLOWSHIPS
 
The NASA Postdoctoral Program (NPP) provides opportunities for 
scientists and engineers to conduct research largely of their own 
choosing, yet compatible with the research opportunities posted on 
the NPP Web site.
 
Selected by a competitive peer-review process, NPP Fellows complete 
one- to three-year Fellowship appointments that advance NASA’s 
missions in earth science, heliophysics, planetary science, 
astrophysics, space bioscience, aeronautics and engineering, human 
exploration and space operations, and astrobiology.
 
An example of one of the research opportunities in planetary science 
is:
 
https://www3.orau.gov/NPDoc/Catalog/17701  
 
Applicants must have a Ph.D. or equivalent degree in hand before 
beginning the fellowship, but may apply while completing the degree 
requirements. U. S. citizens, Lawful Permanent Residents, and 
foreign nationals eligible for J-1 status as a Research Scholar may 
apply.
 
Stipends start at $53,500 per year, with supplements for high cost-
of-living areas and for certain academic specialties. Financial 
assistance is available for relocation and health insurance, and 
$8,000 per year is provided for professional travel.

Applications are accepted three times each year: March 1, July 1, 
and November 1.
