ICARUS SPECIAL ISSUE: 2013 SATURN AURORAL CAMPAIGN

In April and May 2013 the Cassini spacecraft, the Hubble Space 
Telescope, and a number of ground-based telescopes undertook an 
unprecedented observing campaign to study the aurora of Saturn, 
forming the most comprehensive set of remote and in-situ observations 
of this spectacular interaction between the planet's atmosphere, 
magnetosphere, and solar wind. Auroral emissions were recorded in the 
ultraviolet, visible, infrared, and radio, and a host of in-situ 
Cassini instruments measured the magnetic field and plasma environment 
inside the magnetosphere of Saturn, enabling unique synergistic studies 
of every region of the magnetosphere and planetary atmosphere that form 
part of this process. We'd like to publish the results of this campaign 
in a special issue of Icarus. 

Topics of interest include:

+ Characterizing the mechanisms that drive auroral processes at Saturn. 
+ Comparing simultaneous auroral emission from the northern and 
  southern polar regions.
+ Comparisons between ultraviolet, visible, and infrared auroral 
  emissions, enabling direct comparisons between ionospheric and 
  magnetospheric emissions. 
+ Monitoring long term trends in auroral intensity in both hemispheres 
  to isolate seasonal and intrinsic (magnetic field) dependences.

Geologic Processes in Early Planetary History
Department of Geological Sciences, Brown University
 
The Department of Geological Sciences (http://www.geo.brown.edu/), 
Brown University, invites applications for a Tenured/Tenure-Track 
Professor faculty position in Geologic Processes in Early Planetary 
History. Recent and ongoing missions to the Moon, Mars, Mercury, outer 
planet satellites and asteroids have produced unprecedented high 
spatial and spectral resolution data on the nature of ancient planetary 
crusts and the geological, geodynamic, accretion, differentiation, 
chemical, biological and atmospheric processes that modify them. These 
are providing new avenues for research on early planetary history. 
Candidates with interests in these broad areas are encouraged to apply. 
Candidates should complement our current planetary science strengths in 
crustal evolution, volcanism, impact cratering, and remote sensing and 
departmental focus areas of Earth system history, tectonophysics, and 
Earth materials and processes. This will be an open rank search 
(Assistant, Associate, or Full Professor) and will be available as soon 
as July 1, 2014 but will remain open until filled. Review and 
evaluation of applications will begin on March 15, 2014. 

Applicants should forward a letter of interest, current CV, statements 
of research and teaching interests, and the names of three references 
to:

VISITING FACULTY POSITION
 
Mount Holyoke College invites applications for a one-year, full- or 
half-time visiting faculty position beginning September 2014 in 
Astronomy. Duration of appointment may be extended. Teaching 
responsibilities will include up to five courses in some combination 
of introductory astronomy, planetary science, and an additional 
upper-level course in a topic to be determined. Along with nearby 
Amherst, Hampshire, and Smith Colleges, and the University of 
Massachusetts at Amherst, MHC is an active member of the Five College 
Astronomy Department. The successful candidate must be dedicated to 
undergraduate education and enjoy working with students. Candidates 
must hold a Ph.D. in astronomy, planetary science, physics, or a 
closely-related field.

[NASA] FINAL TEXT FOR SOLAR SYSTEM WORKINGS AO
 
The Solar System Workings (SSW) program element supports research into 
atmospheric, climatological, dynamical, geologic, geophysical, and 
geochemical processes occurring on planetary bodies, satellites, and 
other minor bodies (including rings) in the Solar System. This call 
seeks to address the physical and chemical processes that affect the 
surfaces, interiors, atmospheres, exospheres, and magnetospheres of 
planetary bodies. A wide range of investigations will be covered, 
including theoretical studies, analytical and numerical modeling, 
sample-based studies of extraterrestrial materials, field work, 
laboratory studies, and data synthesis relevant to the physical and 
chemical processes affecting planetary systems.
 
This amendment presents the final text for SSW, which replaces the 
prior text in its entirety. Proposals to this program will be taken 
by a two-step process, in which the Notice of Intent is replaced by a 
required Step-1 proposal submitted by an organization Authorized 
Organizational Representative. Only proposers who submit a Step-1 
proposal are eligible to submit a Step-2 (full) proposal. See Section 3 
for details. Step-1 proposals are due May 23, 2014, and Step-2 
proposals are due July 25, 2014.

scientists and engineers to conduct research largely of their own 
choosing, yet compatible with the research opportunities posted on the 
NPP Web site.
 
Selected by a competitive peer-review process, NPP Fellows complete 
one- to three-year Fellowship appointments that advance NASA's missions 
in earth science, heliophysics, planetary science, astrophysics, space 
bioscience, aeronautics and engineering, human exploration and space 
operations, and astrobiology.
 
An example of one of the research opportunities in planetary science 
is:
 
https://www3.orau.gov/NPDoc/Catalog/17717
 
Applicants must have a Ph.D. or equivalent degree in hand before 
beginning the fellowship, but may apply while completing the degree 
requirements. U. S. citizens, Lawful Permanent Residents, and foreign 
nationals eligible for J-1 status as a Research Scholar may apply.
 
Stipends start at $53,500 per year, with supplements for high 
cost-of-living areas and for certain academic specialties. Financial 
assistance is available for relocation and health insurance, and 
$8,000 per year is provided for professional travel.

CLAY MINERALS SOCIETY MEETING SPECIAL SESSION: MARTIAN CLAYS

May 17-21

Conveners: Bethany Ehlmann (Caltech & JPL), Doug Ming (JSC)

Between Opportunity, Curiosity, meteorites, and continuing orbital 
data, it's been an exciting year for clay minerals on Mars. This year's 
convening of the Clay Mineral Society on the Texas A&M campus thus 
includes a special session for unraveling what it all means: "Clay 
Mineralogy & Geochemistry on Mars". Martian clay mineral abstracts are 
due by February 28th.

INTERPLANETARY SMALL SATELLITE CONFERENCE
 
Call for abstracts
 
Caltech will host the Interplanetary Small Satellite Conference on 
April 28-29, 2014, Pasadena, CA
 
The 2014 Interplanetary Small Satellite Conference is designed for 
small spacecraft experts from industry, government, and academia. Small 
satellites are typically defined as less than 500 kg, however we 
strongly encourage papers that focus on satellites on the scale of less 
than 50 kg. The conference promotes interdisciplinary understanding of 
exploration by small spacecraft and interplanetary systems, including 
novel science and technology, and their applications to educational, 
government, and commercial endeavors.
 
The attendees will include members from the science and engineering 
communities interested in space exploration missions and technologies. 
The goal is for attendees to share their knowledge and experience, as 
well as identify challenges for interplanetary small satellite systems. 
There will be plenty of opportunities to network and develop lasting 
relationships, benefiting participants, their organizations, and the 
science and engineering communities at large.
 
Conference details and abstract submission instructions can be found 
here:

Sincerely,
 
Alessandra Babuscia on behalf of the organizing committee

MARS CRITICAL DATA PRODUCTS PROGRAM (ROUND IX) 

Initial Landing Site Characterization for the Mars 2020 Rover Mission
 
The Mars Exploration Program has issued, in January 2014, a Request for 
Proposal for round IX of the Mars Critical Data Products program. This 
RFP provides support for initial landing site surface, atmosphere, and 
gravity characterization for the Mars 2020 rover mission. The intent is 
to convert mission data and numerical simulations into products focused 
on specific landing site targets (to be provided by the program) that 
will be useful for reducing the risk to the Mars 2020 rover mission. 
Proposals are due on Wednesday, March 5, 2014.

Ellen Stofan, James Garvin, Michael Meyer, Doug McCuistion, Penelope 
Boston, Marc Kaufman, Buzz Aldrin, Joel Levine, Miles O'Brien, Rebecca 
Keiser, Victoria Friedensen, and many more.
