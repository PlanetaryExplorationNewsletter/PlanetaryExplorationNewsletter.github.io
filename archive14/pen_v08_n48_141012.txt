[NASA] ANTICIPATED MAJOR CHANGES BETWEEN THE DRAFT AND FINAL DISCOVERY 
2014 ANNOUNCEMENTS OF OPPORTUNITY
 
On July 2, 2014, NASA’s Science Mission Directorate (SMD) released a 
Draft Announcement of Opportunity (AO) for Discovery Program missions.
SMD is now issuing information on anticipated major changes between 
the Draft and Final AOs.
 
Clarification details can be found in the full announcement document 
posted at:

http://discovery.larc.nasa.gov/

Topics include: 

Inclusion of a Classified Heritage Appendix
Use of the Advanced Multi-Mission Operations System
Engineering Science Investigation on Entry, Descent, and Landing
Clarification of the Exclusion of "Mission Operations" from the 
   Pi-Managed Cost Cap
Clarification of Rules Regarding Allocation of Returned Samples to 
   Non-U.S. Partners
Clarification of the Evaluation of the Risk of NASA-Developed 
   Technologies
Clarification of the Conjunction Assessment Risk Analysis Requirement
Clarification of the Requirement for Independent Verification and 
   Validation (IV&V) of Flight Software
Addition of a Requirement to Provide an Electronic Version of the 
   Project Schedule

NASA has not approved the issuance of the Final Discovery AO and this 
notification does not obligate NASA to issue the AO and solicit 
proposals.

[NASA] DRAFT COOPERATIVE AGREEMENT NOTICE (CAN) FOR SMD SCIENCE 
EDUCATION TO BE RELEASED

The NASA Science Mission Directorate (SMD) will release a draft 
Cooperative Agreement Notice (CAN) soliciting team-based proposals for 
science education by the end of October at:

http://tinyurl.com/npm4tzy 

Comments on this draft text are due to the point of contact below no 
later than 30 days after release of the draft text. The final CAN will 
be issued early in calendar year 2015.

The goal of the NASA SMD Science Education CAN is to meet the 
following NASA SMD Science Education Objectives: Enabling STEM 
education, improving U.S. science literacy; advancing National 
education goals; and leveraging science education through partnerships. 
NASA intends to select one or more focused, science discipline-based 
team(s). 

Neither the issuance of this Announcement nor the draft CAN obligates
NASA to issue the final CAN or solicit proposals. The final CAN may 
contain provisions that differ from the draft CAN, in which case those 
provisions in the final CAN would take precedence.

All comments and questions should be directed to the Point of Contact:

INVITATION FOR PDS REVIEWERS FOR THE OSIRIS-REX MISSION

The PDS is inviting reviewers for the Origins Spectral Interpretation 
Resource Identification Security Regolith Explorer (OSIRIS-REx) 
asteroid sample return mission. The PDS is establishing several review 
panels for the data products that will be produced during the OSIRIS-
REx mission. We need reviewers for the optical cameras, spectrometers, 
and laser altimeter. Initial reviews will begin soon for product and 
pipeline design, with flight data reviews following after launch and 
before the spacecraft reaches the asteroid in 2019. This is a 
valuable opportunity for those interested in learning about and 
working with OSIRIS-Rex data products.

"WISE AT 5" CONFERENCE

We are pleased to announce a conference on "WISE at 5: Legacy and 
Prospects" to be held February 10-12, 2015, at the Beckman Institute 
Auditorium of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena.

The conference will celebrate what has been done with WISE, what is 
being done with NEOWISE, and what will be done in the future.

NASA's Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) was launched into 
orbit 5 years ago, and surveyed the entire mid-infrared sky in 2010. 
The satellite resumed surveying as NEOWISE in December 2013, and by 
the time of the conference will be on its fifth pass over the sky. 
Over 1,000 refereed papers based on the data have now been published, 
with results ranging from the discovery of the first Earth Trojan 
asteroid, to challenging the standard paradigm for quasar unification.

For further information, see the conference website:

LARGE MARTIAN LANDFORMS WEBSITE

An extensive, organized collection of more than 1100 photos of Martian 
landforms is now available for education and research. The collection 
was created by Roger Weller at Cochise College in Sierra Vista, 
Arizona. Many of the photos not only highlight scientific details of 
the landforms but also include impressive, oblique scenic views.

The website can be accessed at:

http://skywalker.cochise.edu/wellerr/mars/list.htm

or just Google: "cochise mars landforms".

This collection of Martian photos is a portion of a much larger 
collection of geological information:

NASA POSTDOCTORAL FELLOWSHIPS

The NASA Postdoctoral Program (NPP) provides opportunities for 
scientists and engineers to conduct research largely of their own 
choosing, yet compatible with the research opportunities posted on 
the NPP Web site.

Selected by a competitive peer-review process, NPP Fellows complete 
one- to three-year Fellowship appointments that advance NASA's missions 
in earth science, heliophysics, planetary science, astrophysics, space 
bioscience, aeronautics and engineering, human exploration and space 
operations, and astrobiology.

An example of one of the research opportunities in planetary science 
is:

https://www3.orau.gov/NPDoc/Catalog/18115

Applicants must have a Ph.D. or equivalent degree in hand before 
beginning the fellowship, but may apply while completing the degree 
requirements. U. S. citizens, Lawful Permanent Residents, and foreign 
nationals eligible for J-1 status as a Research Scholar may apply.

Stipends start at $53,500 per year, with supplements for high 
cost-of-living areas and for certain academic specialties. Financial 
assistance is available for relocation and health insurance, and 
$8,000 per year is provided for professional travel.

Applications are accepted three times each year: March 1, July 1, and 
November 1.
