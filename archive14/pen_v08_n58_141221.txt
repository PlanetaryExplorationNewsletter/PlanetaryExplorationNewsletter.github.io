PLANETARY GEOMORPHOLOGY AT EGU ABSTRACT DEADLINE APPROACHING FAST!

The Planetary Geomorphology session (GM10.1/PS9.5, EGU 2015 Vienna 
Austria 12 - 17 April) welcomes abstracts concerning landforms and 
the processes that shape them on all solar system bodies. Earth 
analogue studies, flume/simulation work and novel approaches using 
remote sensing data are especially encouraged. This session has always 
provided a stimulating forum for cross-disciplinary discussion and we 
hope you'll join us once again to bring geomorphology and planetary 
science closer together.

The final deadline for abstracts is 7th January 2015.

EGU 2015 SESSION PS2.3: MARS SCIENCE AND EXPLORATION

Dear Colleagues,  

The abstract submission for the EGU General Assembly to be held 12-17 
April 2015, in Vienna, Austria, is open until January 7. We would like 
to invite you to submit abstracts to our Mars session: 

http://meetingorganizer.copernicus.org/EGU2015/session/17354 

This session will address the latest results on the interior, surface, 
atmosphere and ionosphere of Mars from recent and ongoing Mars 
missions. In particular, the session is primarily targeted at: 

(1) presentations on scientific investigations as well as theoretical 
models concerning the deep interior and subsurface structure and 
composition; the surface geology; the atmospheric composition, 
dynamics and climate; the ionospheric environment and its interaction 
with the solar wind; Phobos, water evolution, astrobiology and 
habitability of Mars; 

(2) discussions on scientific goals, long-term plans and proposed 
experiments for future robotic and human missions to Mars, as well 
as results obtained from ground-based measurements. Both broad 
solicited talks and contributed presentations will be included in 
the program.

Following the passing of Professors Gerhard Neukum and Collin 
Pillinger in 2014, we decided to dedicate the session to them.

Hope to see you in Vienna!  
With best regards,
Damien Loizeau, Olivier Witasse

EGU 2015 SESSION PS3.2: HUYGENS PROBE 10TH ANNIVERSARY SESSION

Session Summary: On January 14, 2005, the European Space Agency's 
Huygens probe arrived at and landed on Saturn's Largest moon Titan. 
Huygens was an important element of the international Cassini mission 
to Saturn which continues until 2017. The data from the Huygens science 
investigations, developed under true international partnerships, 
continues to be used to this day to improve our understanding of Titan, 
the Saturn system and the other giant planets, and the solar system. 
Ten years later we remember the development of the Huygens mission, 
and we reflect on the impact of Huygens' remarkable achievements on 
solar system science.

This session will highlight the Huygens mission, the major discoveries 
of Huygens, and will consider the significance these discoveries in 
the broader perspective of Saturn, the giant planets, and the solar 
system.

Clicking on the PS3.2 Abstract Submission link will allow you to log 
in to the Copernicus Office Meeting Organizer. You may submit the text 
of your contribution as plain text, LaTeX, or MS Word content.

The abstract deadline for EGU 2015 is in three weeks, 
07 January 2015, 13:00 CET.

IUGG 2015 SESSION VS26: VOLCANIC LANDSCAPE ACROSS THE SOLAR 
SYSTEM - FROM FIELD TO REMOTE SENSING ANALYSES

Volcanic processes are efficient mechanisms to reshape planetary 
surfaces and provide valuable information about planetary interiors 
and landscape evolution. The study of geological, and in particular 
volcanic, processes across the Solar System is at the crossroad of 
many scientific disciplines using in-situ sampling and analysis, 
remotely sensed data, or experimental and numerical modelling. Our 
symposium aims to compile all facets of volcanism and associated 
interactions with other geological processes (e.g., impacts, tectonics) 
observed in our Solar System. By providing a forum for a broad range of 
terrestrial and extraterrestrial volcanic landforms and their 
underlying formational processes, these observations and 
interpretations will be investigated and (re)viewed in the light of 
our current understanding of related processes on Earth. Comparative 
studies on volcanic processes on Earth using multi-instrumental, 
remotely sensed, experimental, computational, or field data are 
particularly welcome.

26th IUGG General Assembly, Prague, Czech Republic
June 22-July, 2 2015
Abstract submission deadline is January 31, 2015.

[NASA] K2 GUEST OBSERVER - CYCLE 2 UPDATE

This program solicits proposals for the acquisition and analysis of 
new data from the K2 mission:

http://keplerscience.arc.nasa.gov/K2

K2 repurposes the space-borne hardware and ground-based operations of 
the Kepler mission for a pointed survey of predetermined locations 
along the ecliptic plane. The single, visible-wavelength instrument 
onboard K2 provides high-precision photometry capability, with short 
cadence and long cadence modes (1 minute and 30 minute exposures).

Only proposers who submit a Step-1 proposal will be eligible to 
submit a Step-2 (full) proposal. Potential proposers are strongly 
encouraged to carefully read the information about the two-step 
proposal process provided in Section 4 of D.13.

Step-1 proposals to D.13 K2 Guest Observer - Cycle 2 will not take 
a separately uploaded PDF "proposal" document. Instead, text in 
the "Proposal Summary" box on the cover pages will be the 
description of the Step-1 proposal. 

The due dates remain unchanged.
Step-1 proposals are due January 16, 2015
Step-2 proposals are due February 27, 2015

SAVE THE DATE - VENUS CONFERENCE 4-8 APRIL 2016, OXFORD UK

We announce an International Venus Conference to be held in April 2016. 

The conference will invite presentations on all aspects of Venus 
science, from the interior to the exosphere. Comparative planetology 
talks (highlighting parallels with other planets in our solar system 
or with exoplanets), and presentations related to future missions
or investigations, are welcome. The programme will comprise invited 
and contributed talks, as well as posters. 

The abstract deadline is tentatively set for 8 Jan 2016.

Following on from earlier conferences held in La Thuile (2007, 2008), 
Aussois (2010) and Catania (2013), the Venus 2016 meeting will be 
held in Magdalen College, in the centre of Oxford, UK. Conference 
participants will be able to stay in rooms in Magdalen college or 
in nearby colleges and hotels - details will be posted on the 
conference website:

www.venus2016.uk

Thanks to our sponsors, the registration fee will be subsidised and 
financial support for early-career scientists will be available.

An "indication of interest" link will shortly be added to the 
website to ensure that you are kept informed with future conference 
announcements, but in the meantime please mark the conference dates 
on your calendar.

WORKSHOP ON THE POTENTIAL FOR FINDING LIFE IN A EUROPA PLUME

Current Europa missions under study by NASA are focused on answering 
the question "Is Europa habitable?" However, the potential presence 
of water plumes on the satellite could present an opportunity to 
pursue the question "Is there life on Europa?" Answering this question 
is far more challenging because measurements currently possible may 
provide only ambiguous results from a mission that either orbits or 
flies by Europa at relatively high velocity. To that end, NASA's 
Planetary Science Division is convening a workshop February 18, 2015 
at NASA Ames Research Center to consider strategies to investigate 
Europa's putative plumes for evidence of life.

A second announcement with further details and abstract submission 
instructions will be forthcoming by early January 2015. Although 
participation in person is encouraged, provision will be made for 
remote participation.

The workshop will be followed on Feb. 19-20 by a meeting of the Outer 
Planets Assessment Group that will also be held at the Ames Research 
Center.

ATLAS OF METEORITES

Cambridge University Press is pleased to announce the publication of 
"Atlas of Meteorites" by Monica Grady, Giovanni Pratesi, and Vanni 
Moggi Cecchi. The fruit of many years of labor, the Atlas is a 
complete visual reference for meteorite classification, combining high 
resolution optical microscope images with detailed descriptions. 
Hundreds of full-color microscope images of thin sections of 
meteorites highlight their textural and compositional differences. 
It provides a systematic account of meteorites and their most 
important classification parameters, making it an essential resource 
for meteorite researchers.
