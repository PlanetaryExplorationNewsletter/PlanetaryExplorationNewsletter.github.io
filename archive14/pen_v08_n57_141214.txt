EGU 2015 CALL FOR ABSTRACTS: SESSION PS2.5

Dear Colleagues,  
The abstract submission for the EGU General Assembly to be held 12-17 
April 2015, in Vienna, Austria, is open. We would like to invite you 
to submit abstracts to our session PS2.5 on Atmospheres of Terrestrial 
Planets: 

http://meetingorganizer.copernicus.org/EGU2015/session/17355  

This session focuses on the atmospheres of terrestrial planets from 
the boundary layer up to the thermosphere. With the multiple missions 
focused on Mars, Venus and Titan, the research on planetary 
atmospheres and their evolution is blooming with new results and 
advances. We welcome you to share your work with the community as 
contributions discussing any aspect of the neutral atmospheres of 
terrestrial planets and Titan. Contributions dealing with terrestrial-
like extrasolar planets are also welcomed. The abstract submission 
deadline is 07 January 2015. 

Please do not hesitate to distribute this email to other scientists 
who might be interested in submitting an abstract, or to contact us 
in case you have questions.  

Hope to see you in Vienna!  
With best regards, 
The conveners 
Anni Määttänen, Emmanuel Marcq, Francisco González-Galindo

NASA POSTDOCTORAL FELLOWSHIPS
 
The NASA Postdoctoral Program (NPP) provides opportunities for 
scientists and engineers to conduct research largely of their own 
choosing, yet compatible with the research opportunities posted on the 
NPP Web site.
 
Selected by a competitive peer-review process, NPP Fellows complete 
one- to three-year Fellowship appointments that advance NASA’s missions 
in earth science, heliophysics, planetary science, astrophysics, space 
bioscience, aeronautics and engineering, human exploration and space 
operations, and astrobiology.
 
An example of one of the research opportunities in planetary science 
is:
 
https://www3.orau.gov/NPDoc/Catalog/18818   
 
Applicants must have a Ph.D. or equivalent degree in hand before 
beginning the fellowship, but may apply while completing the degree 
requirements. U. S. citizens, Lawful Permanent Residents, and foreign 
nationals eligible for J-1 status as a Research Scholar may apply.
 
Stipends start at $53,500 per year, with supplements for high cost-of-
living areas and for certain academic specialties. Financial assistance 
is available for relocation and health insurance, and $8,000 per year 
is provided for professional travel.
 
Applications are accepted three times each year: March 1, July 1, and
November 1.

ROSES-14 CALL: SMALL, INNOVATIVE MISSIONS FOR PLANETARY EXPLORATION 
(SIMPLEX)

The Small, Innovative Missions for Planetary Exploration (SIMPLEx) call 
supports the formulation and development of science investigations that 
require a spaceflight mission that can be accomplished using small 
spacecraft. All proposed investigations must be responsive to the goals 
of the Planetary Science Division as described in the2014 Science 
Mission Directorate Science Plan available at: 

http://science1.nasa.gov/about us/science strategy/

Proposed investigations may target any body in the Solar System except 
for the Earth and Sun, in order to advance the objectives outlined in 
the Science Plan. Investigations of extra solar planets are not 
solicited in this NRA.
 
Step-1 proposals are due January 13, 2015, and Step-2 proposals are 
due March 13, 2015.

JOB OPPORTUNITY: STSCI RESEARCH AND INSTRUMENT ANALYSTS

The Space Telescope Science Institute has openings for Research and
Instrument Analysts (RIA) in our Instruments Division. RIAs will
assist Instrument Scientists in the reduction and analysis of Hubble
Space Telescope calibration data. Analysts will also assist in the
development and testing of the scientific instruments and optical
systems for the James Webb Space Telescope. They will provide user
support to HST General Observers and Archival Researchers in various
aspects of observation planning and data reduction. Additionally,
analysts may become involved in cutting-edge astronomical research by
providing support for scientific programs of staff scientists. Such
support can involve calibrating data, photometry, spectroscopy, image
drizzling, coding, and laboratory work in astronomical 
instrumentation.

Successful applicants typically have a Bachelor's, Master's or a
recent PhD degree in Astronomy, Physics, Astrophysics, Planetary
Science, or related fields. The starting position (RIA I, II, Senior)
and salary are commensurate with education and experience. Experience
with astronomical research, instrumentation or optics, scientific
computing, data analysis, and IRAF or other astronomical software
packages, is also desired. Additional mathematical, statistical, and
programming skills (e.g. IDL, python) are a plus.

Applications due: January 31, 2015
