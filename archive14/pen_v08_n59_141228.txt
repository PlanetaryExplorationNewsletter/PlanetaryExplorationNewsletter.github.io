BLOOMBERG DISTINGUISHED PROFESSORSHIP, JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY

A Bloomberg Distinguished Professorship in the broad area of exoplanets 
and extra-solar planetary science is available at the Johns Hopkins 
University. This position is one of 50 new Bloomberg Distinguished 
Professorships designated for outstanding scholars who carry out 
interdisciplinary research and teaching in areas identified for 
significant growth at the University. The position will include joint 
tenure in the Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences and the 
Department of Physics and Astronomy of the Johns Hopkins Krieger School 
of Arts and Sciences, and will be at the rank of tenured Associate 
Professor or Full Professor. The holder of this Bloomberg Distinguished 
Professorship will participate in research and teaching in both of the 
above departments. Opportunities exist for collaborations with the 
Space Telescope Science Institute and the Space Department of the Johns 
Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory. Applicants should possess 
distinguished records of achievement in research in the area of 
exoplanets, as well as commitment to the teaching of undergraduate and 
graduate students compatible with appointment to tenure. Applicants 
should have the ability to provide major scientific and technical 
leadership at JHU and a demonstrated commitment to cross-disciplinary 
collaborations. Apply at:

NASA POSTDOCTORAL FELLOWSHIPS

The NASA Postdoctoral Program (NPP) provides opportunities for 
scientists and engineers to conduct research largely of their own 
choosing, yet compatible with the research opportunities posted on 
the NPP Web site.

Selected by a competitive peer-review process, NPP Fellows complete 
one- to three-year Fellowship appointments that advance NASA's missions 
in Earth science, heliophysics, astrophysics, planetary science, 
astrobiology, space bioscience, aeronautics and engineering, human 
exploration and operations, and space technology.

An example of one of the research opportunities in planetary science 
is:

https://www3.orau.gov/NPDoc/Catalog/18314    

Applicants must have a Ph.D. or equivalent degree in hand before 
beginning the fellowship, but may apply while completing the degree 
requirements. U.S. citizens, Lawful Permanent Residents, and foreign 
nationals eligible for J-1 status as a Research Scholar may apply.

Stipends start at $53,500 per year, with supplements for high 
cost-of-living areas and for certain academic specialties. Financial 
assistance is available for relocation and health insurance, and 
$8,000 per year is provided for professional travel.

Applications are accepted three times each year: March 1, July 1, 
and November 1.
