DAWN RELATED ROSES SOLICITATION ANNOUNCEMENT

The Dawn Focused Research and Analysis Program (DFRAP) will not be 
solicited. Instead, the scope of the Discovery Data Analysis Program 
(DDAP), has been expanded to include the Dawn mission data. 
The Planetary Science Division intends to issue a call for the Dawn 
Guest Investigator Program through ROSES-2014. 

Those contemplating fundamental research associated with Ceres that 
would not be appropriate for DDAP should consider Solar System 
Workings (SSW). HOWEVER, THE SSW STEP-1 PROPOSAL DUE DATE IS THIS 
FRIDAY, MAY 23, 2014. 

Step-2 SSW proposals are due July 25, 2014. DDAP due dates remain 
unchanged. DDAP Step-1 proposals are due July 14, 2014, and Step-2 
proposals are due September 12, 2014.

While SSW was always open to eligible work on Ceres, PSD management 
understands that some who may have been planning to propose Ceres 
fundamental research to DFRAP (only) now have to redirect to SSW at 
short notice. PSD regrets the inconvenience and will work with them as 
needed. 

If you are concerned about hitting the Step-1 deadline or unsure if 
your work is eligible to DDAP or SSW, contact Mary Voytek and Christina 
Richey ASAP, and they can work with you to ensure you get your Step-2 
in to SSW in a timely manner. As promised by Jim Green earlier this 
year, anyone who submit a scientifically-meritorious proposal will be 
reviewed this year in PSD.
