[NASA] REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) FOR MATERIALSLAB WORKSHOP: NEW 
WORKSHOP DATES

NASA has rescheduled the MaterialsLAB Workshop from the original 
January dates to April 15-16, 2014. The workshop is being held to 
advise NASA on future research directions for the microgravity 
materials science program. The two-day event will bring together 
scientists and engineers from academia, industry, and other government 
agencies to assist NASA in identifying key engineering drivers and 
research priorities for the next generation of materials science 
experiments to be developed for the International Space Station.
 
The full RFI and submission instructions can be found at:

Topical areas for the workshop break-out sessions include: Metals, 
Semiconductors, Polymers, Biomaterials, Nanomaterials, Glasses, 
Granular Materials, Ceramics, Organics, and Composites.

[NASA] MARS CRITICAL DATA PRODUCTS PROGRAM (ROUND IX) - INITIAL LANDING
SITE CHARACTERIZATION FOR THE MARS 2020 ROVER MISSION

The Mars Exploration Program has issued, in January 2014, a Request for 
Proposal (RFP) for Round IX of the Mars Critical Data Products program. 
This RFP provides support for initial landing site surface, atmosphere, 
and gravity characterization for the Mars 2020 rover mission. The 
intent is to convert mission data and numerical simulations into 
products focused on specific landing site targets (to be provided by 
the program) that will be useful for reducing the risk to the Mars 2020 
rover mission. 

Proposals are due on Wednesday, March 5, 2014.
 
Details of the RFPs are posted at: 

https://acquisition.jpl.nasa.gov/rfp/WH-2691-120313.htm

NASA POSTDOCTORAL FELLOWSHIPS
 
The NASA Postdoctoral Program (NPP) provides opportunities for 
scientists and engineers to conduct research largely of their own 
choosing, yet compatible with the research opportunities posted on the 
NPP Web site.
 
Selected by a competitive peer-review process, NPP Fellows complete 
one- to three-year Fellowship appointments that advance NASA's 
missions in earth science, heliophysics, planetary science, 
astrophysics, space bioscience, aeronautics and engineering, human 
exploration and space operations, and astrobiology.
 
An example of one of the research opportunities in planetary science 
is:
 
https://www3.orau.gov/NPDoc/Catalog/18696         
 
Applicants must have a Ph.D. or equivalent degree in hand before 
beginning the fellowship, but may apply while completing the degree 
requirements. U. S. citizens, Lawful Permanent Residents, and 
foreign nationals eligible for J-1 status as a Research Scholar may 
apply.
 
Stipends start at $53,500 per year, with supplements for high 
cost-of-living areas and for certain academic specialties. Financial 
assistance is available for relocation and health insurance, and 
$8,000 per year is provided for professional travel.

Applications are accepted three times each year: March 1, July 1, and 
November 1.

[NASA] CANCELLATION OF THE LUNAR ADVANCED SCIENCE AND EXPLORATION CALL

The Lunar Advanced Science and Exploration Research (LASER) program 
funds basic and applied lunar science. The objective of the LASER 
program was to conduct a suite of lunar science investigations spanning 
the continuum from basic science to applied exploration science. 
Proposals having significant components of both basic and applied lunar 
science that further our understanding of the Moon and how to conduct 
science there are sought and highly encouraged.
 
When ROSES 2013 was released a year ago it included the LASER call with 
had a due date in spring 2014. Since the Planetary Science Division has 
reorganized its research program this call is redundant with new calls 
that will be released this year. See:

http://www.lpi.usra.edu/PSD-RandA/

Proposers to LASER should look for ROSES 2014 Appendix C.8, the Lunar 
Data Analysis Program (LDAP) program, as well as ROSES 2014 Appendices 
C.2, Emerging Worlds; C.3, The Solar System Workings program; and C.7, 
Planetary Data Archiving, Restoration, and Tools.

AOGS SPECIAL SESSION PS04: C/ISON AND OTHER COMETS OF 2013

The year 2013 saw many interesting comets, from C/PanSTARRS, C/Lemmon, 
2P/Encke to the globally observed sungrazer, C/ISON, and discovery of 
C/Lovejoy. With the ROSETTA mission on its way to its target 67P/CG, 
the field of cometary sciences is providing a rich field for observers, 
modellers, and experimentalists to expand the field. We invite invited 
and contributed presentations that address any aspect of these comets 
of 2013 and other cometary studies. We anticipate a half-day to a full 
day session.

Abstract Deadline: 11 February 2014

AOGS SPECIAL SESSION PS05: POLARIMETRY OF SOLAR SYSTEM, EXOPLANETS,
BROWN DWARFS AND DISKS

Polarimetry is currently enjoying a rejuvenation in various 
astronomical applications. As a complementary technique to imaging and 
spectroscopy, polarization allows the investigation of scattering 
properties of variety of media ranging from planetary atmospheres, 
comets, small bodies (planetary satellites, asteroids, Kuiper Belt 
objects, etc.) to detection and characterization of exoplanets, brown 
dwarfs, star and planet forming regions; characterization of magnetic 
fields and search for optically active molecules in a search for 
habitability elsewhere than our earth. We invite contributions from 
observers, modellers, laboratory measurements, instrument designers 
and missions. We anticipate half to one day of presentations including 
oral and poster contributions.

NASA SOLAR SYSTEM EXPLORATION RESEARCH VIRTUAL INSTITUTE'S EXPLORATION
SCIENCE FORUM

First Announcement

The Solar System Exploration Research Institute (SSERVI) is pleased to 
announce the 1st annual NASA Exploration Science Forum (ESF), to be 
held in person July 21-23, 2014 at NASA Ames Research Center, Moffett 
Field, CA. This year's forum will feature scientific discussions of 
exploration targets of interest (the Moon, near-Earth asteroids, and 
the moons of Mars). Science sessions will focus on recent mission 
results and in-depth analyses of science and exploration studies. 
Dedicated side-conferences for graduate students and young 
professionals (a graduate student conference and Next Generation Lunar 
Scientists and Engineers, NGLSE) will coincide with the ESF. Public 
engagement discussions will be interwoven among science topics as well. 
Additionally, a 1.5-day meeting discussing science and exploration in 
the Global Exploration Roadmap (GER) will immediately follow the ESF, 
where the scientific community is welcome to attend. 
 
Abstracts will be accepted February 18 through midnight PDT April 26, 
2014 at:

http://sservi.nasa.gov/NESF2014/

The next announcement (February 2014) will discuss Exploration Science 
Forum logistics and details on the GER meeting.  
  
We look forward to another exciting meeting focusing on the 
intersection of science and exploration!

CALL FOR ABSTRACTS FOR THE INTERNATIONAL WORKSHOP ON INSTRUMENTATION
FOR PLANETARY MISSIONS

NASA/GSFC will host  the International Workshop on Instrumentation 
for Planetary Missions November 4-7, 2014,  Greenbelt, Maryland 
(Washington DC, USA).
 
The objective of the Workshop is to have a broad canvas of 
instrumentation and technology available to upcoming 'Decadal Survey' 
missions and those further out. It is also meant to be a forum of 
collaboration, exchange and discussions where science questions, and 
the technology needed to address them, are discussed.
