PH.D. PROGRAM APPLICATION AT INTERNATIONAL RESEARCH SCHOOL OF
PLANETARY SCIENCES (IRSPS), PESCARA, ITALY - CORRECTION

There will be opportunities for potential Ph.D. candidates seeking
training, education, and research in Planetary Geology at the
International Research School of Planetary Sciences (IRSPS,
http://www.irsps.unich.it/) in the Ph.D. course of "Earth Systems and
Built Environments" of Universita d'Annunzio, Pescara, Italy
(http://www.unich.it/). Candidates interested in geological research
of Mars and terrestrial analogs in particular are encouraged to apply.
The selected Ph.D. students are expected to begin their programs from
the beginning of 2015. Ph.D. candidate positions with salary paid for
the duration of the Ph.D. program (3 years) would be available to some
highly-evaluated candidates. Evaluation interview for candidacy for
students residing outside the country would be conducted through
telecon. The deadline for the application is September 9th (13:00 PM,
Italian Time) and it must be sent by registered mail, or by hand or by
private courier to the address indicated in the call. For other
details, please refer to:

[NASA] ROSES-14: DELAY OF STEP-1 PROPOSAL DUE DATE FOR DAWN AT CERES
GUEST INVESTIGATOR PROGRAM

The goals of the in the Dawn at Ceres Guest Investigator Program are 
to: 

a) enhance the scientific return from the Dawn mission by broadening 
participation in the mission and 

b) augment the existing Dawn science team to include new members 
conducting investigations that broaden and/or complement the funded 
Principal Investigator (PI) and Co-Investigator (Co-I)-led 
investigations, thus maximizing the contribution of Dawn to the future
exploration and scientific understanding of the Solar System. Because 
the intention is to enhance and broaden the scientific return, 
investigations submitted by Dawn PIs and Co-Is will not be considered. 
Individuals previously selected as Dawn at Vesta Participating 
Scientists may propose new investigations to this solicitation.

Only proposers who submit a Step-1 proposal will be eligible to 
submit a Step-2 (full) proposal.

Step-1 proposals are now due August 21, 2014. 
Step-2 proposals are due October 9, 2014 (unchanged).

NASA POSTDOCTORAL FELLOWSHIPS

The NASA Postdoctoral Program (NPP) provides opportunities for 
scientists and engineers to conduct research largely of their own 
choosing, yet compatible with the research opportunities posted on 
the NPP Web site.

Selected by a competitive peer-review process, NPP Fellows complete 
one- to three-year Fellowship appointments that advance NASA's 
missions in earth science, heliophysics, planetary science, 
astrophysics, space bioscience, aeronautics and engineering, human 
exploration and space operations, and astrobiology.

A sample opportunity is:

https://www3.orau.gov/NPDoc/Catalog/17702

Applicants must have a Ph.D. or equivalent degree in hand before 
beginning the fellowship, but may apply while completing the degree 
requirements. U. S. citizens, Lawful Permanent Residents, and foreign 
nationals eligible for J-1 status as a Research Scholar may apply.

Stipends start at $53,500 per year, with supplements for high cost-of-
living areas and for certain academic specialties. Financial 
assistance is available for relocation and health insurance, and 
$8,000 per year is provided for professional travel.

Applications are accepted three times each year: March 1, July 1, and 
November 1.

MAVEN POSTDOCTORAL RESEARCHER IN MARS MAGNETIC FIELDS

(NASA-GSFC/CRESST/University of Maryland)

Applications are now being accepted for a Postdoctoral Research 
Associate, funded through the University of Maryland College Park 
(UMCP) and the Center for Research and Exploration in Space Science 
and Technology (CRESST), to work in the Planetary Magnetospheres 
Laboratory of the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) 
investigating Mars magnetic fields using data from the MAVEN (Mars 
Atmosphere and Volatile EvolutioN) mission. 

Additional details are available at:

http://www.astro.umd.edu/employment/

The appointment will be initially for one year, with the possibility 
of renewal in subsequent years. Candidates should have a Ph.D. in a 
relevant discipline with experience conducting scientific research 
related to the MAVEN science objectives or the types of instruments 
included in the MAVEN science payload. Disciplined IDL and Fortran 
programming skills, demonstrated scientific writing ability, and 
experience in acquisition and analysis of data (especially 
magnetometer data) from space flight instruments are highly desirable.

The University of Maryland is an equal opportunity employer. All 
applications received by September 1, 2014 will receive full 
consideration.

POSTDOC OPPORTUNITY: LRO DIVINER

The Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) Diviner science team at
Caltech's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) invites applications for a
postdoctoral scholar position utilizing Diviner data to address topics
in one of the following areas of lunar science: regolith formation and
evolution, surface composition and geology, impact processes, and
volatile stability and transport. In addition to a PhD in a related
field, a strong background in remote sensing and data analysis is
desired. The Diviner science team at JPL uses a wide variety of
methods from data analysis to numerical models and laboratory
experiments to interpret and validate Diviner data. The successful
candidate will be appointed as a California Institute of Technology
postdoctoral scholar, based at JPL, with a 1-year term renewable for
up to three years, depending on available funding. For more
information and to apply, please send a CV and brief description of
research interests Dr. Paul O. Hayne (Paul.O.Hayne@jpl.nasa.gov)

[NASA] PDS - MARS RECONNAISSANCE ORBITER SHARAD RADARGRAM RELEASE 2

The Planetary Data System (PDS) announces the second release of Mars 
Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO) Shallow Radar (SHARAD) radargram data 
processed by the U.S. members of the SHARAD team. This release 
includes data acquired from December 15, 2007 through September 8,
2010. This data set differs from the original SHARAD reduced data set 
(MRO-M-SHARAD-4-RDR-V1.0) in that a different set of processing 
parameters was used, the details of which are described in the document 
RGRAM_PROCESSING.PDF, in the DOCUMENT directory of the archive.

Future releases of this data set are planned to occur approximately 
monthly until the data coverage has caught up with the scheduled 
quarterly releases of MRO data.

ESA POSTDOCTORAL FELLOWSHIPS IN SPACE SCIENCE

The European Space Agency awards several postdoctoral fellowships each
year. The aim of these fellowships is to provide young scientists, 
holding a PhD or the equivalent degree, with the means of performing 
space science research in fields related to the ESA Science and 
Robotic Exploration Programmes. Areas of research include planetary 
science, astronomy and astrophysics, solar and solar-terrestrial 
science, plasma physics and fundamental physics. The fellowships have 
a duration of two years and are tenable at the European Space Research 
and Technology Centre (ESTEC) in Noordwijk, Netherlands, or at the 
European Space Astronomy Centre (ESAC) in Villafranca del Castillo, 
near Madrid, Spain.

Applications are now solicited for fellowships in space science to 
begin in the fall of 2015. Preference will be given to applications 
submitted by candidates within five years of receiving their PhD. 
Candidates not holding a PhD yet are encouraged to apply, but they 
must provide evidence of receiving their degree before starting the 
fellowship.

The deadline for applications is 1 October 2014.
