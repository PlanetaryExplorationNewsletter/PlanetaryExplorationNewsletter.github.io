CALL FOR SPECIAL ISSUE IN PLANETARY AND SPACE SCIENCE ON "SOLAR WIND 
INTERACTION WITH THE TERRESTRIAL PLANETS"

We invite you to participate in a special issue of the Planetary and 
Space Science journal, entitled "Solar Wind Interaction with the 
Terrestrial Planets". Topics will include all aspects of planetary 
plasma physics and interactions in the inner Solar System, e.g.:

(a) magnetospheres, ionospheres, auroras
(b) the solar wind interaction with planets (Mercury, Venus, Earth,
    Mars) and their moons, or with asteroids/comets
(c) plasma interactions with exospheres, dust and surfaces
(d) intercomparisons of planetary environments

Contributions are welcome that address previous, present, 
forthcoming and planned observations from space, as well as ground-
based observations, theoretical modelling or simulations. Laboratory 
studies on planetary analogues aiming to simulate the surface-plasma 
interaction will be considered as well.

The deadline for submission in the 1st of July 2014, leading to a
publication in end of 2014. Regular papers are expected, and the 
usual refereeing process will be applied for publication in PSS. 
Please inform us if a shifted deadline would be more convenient for 
you.

Please indicate your interest in contributing to the special issue, 
together with a preliminary title of the intended paper by March 17.
An approximate abstract, if available, would also be appreciated.

[NASA] ROSES-14 ELIGIBLE TRLS CHANGED FOR PICASSO

The PICASSO Program supports the development of spacecraft-based 
instrument systems that show promise for use in future planetary 
missions. The goal of the program is to conduct planetary and 
astrobiology science instrument feasibility studies, concept formation, 
proof of concept instruments, and advanced component technology 
development to the point where they may be proposed in response to the 
Maturation of Instruments for Solar System Exploration (MatISSE) 
Program, C.13 of ROSES. Therefore, the proposed instrument system or 
advanced components must address specific scientific objectives of 
likely future planetary science missions.
 
The PICASSO Program is intended to enable timely and efficient 
technology infusion into the MatISSE Program and eventually into 
flight missions. As such, the entry technology readiness level (TRL) 
that PICASSO supports is 1-3. Proposals where the entry TRL is 4 or 
higher are not appropriate for the PICASSO, but should be submitted 
to C.13, the MatISSE program.
 
The due dates remain unchanged. 
Step-1 proposals due September 15, 2014.
Step-2 proposals due November 14, 2014.

[NASA] ROSES-14 NOIS NOT A TWO-STEP PROCESS FOR PPR

Planetary protection involves preventing biological contamination on 
both outbound and sample return missions to other planetary bodies. 
Numerous areas of research in astrobiology/exobiology are improving 
our understanding of the potential for survival of Earth microbes 
in extraterrestrial environments, relevant to preventing contamination 
of other bodies by organisms carried on spacecraft. Research is 
required to improve NASA's understanding of the potential for both 
forward and backward contamination, how to minimize it, and to set 
standards in these areas for spacecraft preparation and operating 
procedures. Improvements in technologies and methods for evaluating 
the potential for life in returned samples are also of interest. Many 
of these research areas derive directly from recent National Research 
Council (NRC) recommendations on planetary protection for solar 
system exploration missions.
 
This program will not use the two-step proposal submission process, 
but instead invites optional Notices of Intent (NOIs) by 
April 7, 2014, and proposals are due June 6, 2014.

MAVEN MARS UPPER-ATMOSPHERE AND SOLAR-WIND INTERACTIONS POST-DOC

The Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics (LASP) at the 
University of Colorado Boulder invites applications for a Post-Doctoral 
Research Associate to work on data from the MAVEN mission. The MAVEN 
(Mars Atmosphere and Volatile Evolution) spacecraft arrives at Mars in 
September, and will study the upper atmosphere and ionosphere, 
interactions with the Sun and the solar wind, and the loss of 
atmospheric atoms and molecules to space. The person hired will spend 
approximately up to half of their time on science operations planning 
activities, and the rest of their time integrating data analysis and/or 
theoretical modeling in an area relevant to the mission or in related 
interdisciplinary areas. 

The MAVEN primary mission will last one Earth year from the start of 
science mapping in November, with an expectation that there may be an 
extended mission. The appointment will be initially for one year, with 
the possibility of renewal for subsequent years or through the end of 
the project. Applicants may be at the entry-level post-doc level or may 
be more senior.
