DEADLINE EXTENSION FOR PSS "SOLAR WIND INTERACTIONS WITH THE 
TERRESTRIAL PLANETS"

The deadline for submissions to the special issue "Solar wind 
Interaction with the Terrestrial Planets" in the Planetary and Space 
Science journal is now September 1, 2014. Covered topics include all 
aspects of planetary plasma physics and interactions in the inner 
Solar System, e.g.:

(a) Magnetospheres, ionospheres, auroras
(b) The solar wind interaction with planets (Mercury, Venus, Earth,
    Mars) and their moons, or with asteroids/comets
(c) Plasma interactions with exospheres, dust and surfaces
(d) Intercomparisons of planetary environments

Contributions are welcome that address previous, present, forthcoming 
and planned observations from space, as well as ground-based 
observations, theoretical modelling or simulations. Laboratory studies 
on planetary analogues aiming to simulate the surface-plasma 
interaction are considered as well.

PSS author guidelines are at:

NASA POSTDOCTORAL FELLOWSHIPS

The NASA Postdoctoral Program (NPP) provides opportunities for 
scientists and engineers to conduct research largely of their own 
choosing, yet compatible with the research opportunities posted on the 
NPP Web site.

Selected by a competitive peer-review process, NPP Fellows complete 
one- to three-year Fellowship appointments that advance NASA's missions 
in earth science, heliophysics, planetary science, astrophysics, space 
bioscience, aeronautics and engineering, human exploration and space 
operations, and astrobiology.

An example of one of the research opportunities in planetary science 
is:

https://www3.orau.gov/NPDoc/Catalog/17710

Applicants must have a Ph.D. or equivalent degree in hand before 
beginning the fellowship, but may apply while completing the degree 
requirements. U.S. citizens, Lawful Permanent Residents, and 
foreign nationals eligible for J-1 status as a Research Scholar may 
apply.

Stipends start at $53,500 per year, with supplements for high 
cost-of-living areas and for certain academic specialties. Financial 
assistance is available for relocation and health insurance, and 
$8,000 per year is provided for professional travel.

Applications are accepted three times each year: March 1, July 1, and 
November 1.

[NASA] FINAL TEXT AND A NEW NAME: K2 GUEST OBSERVER - CYCLE 1

This program element solicits proposals for the acquisition and 
analysis of new scientific data from the K2 mission: 

http://keplerscience.arc.nasa.gov/K2 

K2 repurposes the space-borne hardware and ground-based operations of 
the Kepler mission (http://keplerscience.arc.nasa.gov) for a pointed 
survey of pre-determined locations along the ecliptic plane. The 
single, visible-wavelength instrument onboard K2 provides 
high-precision photometry capability, with short cadence and long 
cadence modes (1 minute and 30 minute exposures), and provides a 
powerful tool for broadband variability analyses of planetary, 
stellar, extragalactic and solar system sources.

Proposals to this program will be taken by a two-step process in which 
the Notice of Intent is replaced by a mandatory Step-1 proposal that 
must be submitted by an Authorized Organizational Representative. 

Step-1 proposals are due August 8, 2014 and proposals are due 
September 23, 2014.

NEXT GENERATION LUNAR SCIENTISTS AND ENGINEERS EVENT AT 
NASA EXPLORATION SCIENCE FORUM

Join the Next Generation Lunar Scientists and Engineers (NGLSE) group 
on Wednesday, July 23, for a discussion about mission involvement 
â€“ What roles are available to you at various levels in your career? 
What skills should you develop in order to communicate and work 
together effectively with your peers? 

A panel of experts representing various mission roles will share their 
suggestions and lessons learned. The discussion will take place 
immediately after the Forum at Ames Research Center on Wednesday, 
July 23, from 5:15-6:30 pm in the Main Room in Building 152 (the same 
room as the Exploration Science Forum). The panel discussion will also 
be webcast for those that cannot attend in person (link will be 
available soon).

An informal networking event will take place after the panel discussion 
at a location to be determined.

Cheers,
Noah and Lora

EARLY CAREER PARTICIPANT SUPPORT AVAILABLE FOR NASA OUTER PLANETS
ASSESSMENT GROUP MEETING

NASA's Outer Planets Assessment Group will provide travel grants for 
a limited number of interested Early Career participants to attend the 
OPAG meeting July 23-24 in Bethesda, MD. OPAG plays a key role in 
sculpting the planetary science community's input into NASA activities 
for outer planets science and exploration. Thus it is critical for 
Early Career scientists to attend these meetings both to learn how 
NASA and Planetary Science programs operate and to represent the 
community that will work on OPAG-relevant projects in the coming 
decade. Interested graduate students, postdocs, and other Early Career 
scientists (within 5 years of PhD/MS/BS) should submit a one page 
letter of interest and a CV to curt.niebur@nasa.gov by July 3, 2014. 
Recipients will be notified by July 7. For more information, email 
Curt Niebur (curt.niebur@nasa.gov).

AGU SESSION ANNOUNCEMENT: MERCURY - RESULTS FROM MESSENGER'S 
LOW-ALTITUDE MAPPING CAMPAIGN

We are pleased to announce a special session on Mercury at the 2014 
AGU Fall Meeting in San Francisco, CA, December 15-19, 2014.

NASA's MESSENGER mission, now nearing the fourth and final year of 
orbital operations at Mercury, is well into a low-altitude campaign 
that is returning images and measurements of the planetary surface 
and near-surface that are unprecedented in their resolution. This 
session will highlight the latest results from MESSENGER observations 
and their implications for Mercury's geological evolution, the 
interaction of the planet's exosphere and magnetosphere with the solar 
wind and interplanetary magnetic field, and the planet's geophysical 
and geochemical characteristics. We also welcome contributed papers on 
future mission opportunities, complementary ground-based observations, 
laboratory measurements, and theoretical developments relevant to 
planetary processes at Mercury.

Please consider submitting an abstract for this session. For more 
information, visit: 

https://agu.confex.com/agu/fm14/webprogrampreliminary
/Session2116.html

The submission deadline is August 6, 2014.

Conveners:

Paul Byrne (Lunar and Planetary Institute)
Larry Nittler (Carnegie Institution of Washington)
Sean Solomon (Columbia University)

We look forward to seeing you in San Francisco.

GSA SESSION ANNOUNCEMENT: DYNAMIC PLANETARY GEOLOGY REVEALED BY 
LONG-TERM OBSERVATIONS

The focus of this session is time-variable geology observed on other 
worlds. A decade of Cassini observations in the Saturn system and 17 
years of continuous Mars imaging have facilitated observations of 
active processes. At Mars, documented changes range from crater 
formation to aeolian activity to a variety of seasonal processes and 
slope flows. On Titan, shifting seasons have led to varying lake 
levels and surface changes following convective storms, while the 
distribution of lakes and overlapping dune field patterns reflect 
variability on longer timescales. Jupiter's moon Io is continually 
resurfaced by volcanism, and plumes have now been found on icy 
satellites orbiting 3 of the 4 giant planets. In addition, the Rosetta 
spacecraft arrives this year at comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko and will 
look for signs of activity there. 

We encourage abstracts on observations and/or modeling of 
time-variable features from the Moon to the outer solar system, and 
investigating processes ranging from impact, aeolian, mass-wasting, 
and lacustrine to phase changes and volatile transport over various 
timescales. "Unsuccessful" change detection surveys that provide new 
limits on activity rates are also welcome.

The abstract deadline is July 29.
