[NASA] DRAFT AOS FOR SMALL ASTROPHYSICS EXPLORER MISSIONS AND 
ASTROPHYSICS EXPLORER MISSIONS OF OPPORTUNITY

Comments Due: August 4, 2014

Two draft solicitations for community review and comment have been 
released: the Draft 2014 Small Astrophysics Explorer (SMEX) 
Announcement of Opportunity (AO) and the Draft 2014 Astrophysics 
Explorer Missions of Opportunity (MO) Program Element Appendix (PEA) 
for the Second Stand Alone Missions of Opportunity Notice (SALMON-2) 
AO. The full text of both draft solicitations are available at: 

http://nspires.nasaprs.com/

The Astrophysics Explorers Program conducts Principal Investigator 
(PI)-led space science investigations relevant to SMD's astrophysics 
programs. Explorer investigations must address NASA's goals to discover 
the origin, structure, evolution, and destiny of the Universe and 
search for Earth-like planets.

The comment period for the Draft 2014 SMEX AO and the Draft 2014 
Astrophysics Explorer MO PEA ends on August 4, 2014.

Comments on both drafts may be addressed in writing or by E-mail to 
the Astrophysics Explorer Program Scientist: Dr. Wilton T. Sanders,

[NASA] PDS - MARS RECONNAISSANCE ORBITER SHARAD RADARGRAM RELEASE 1

The Planetary Data System (PDS) announces the first release of Mars
Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO) Shallow Radar (SHARAD) radargram data 
processed by the U.S. members of the SHARAD team. This release includes 
data acquired from December 6, 2006 through December 15, 2007. This 
data set differs from the original SHARAD reduced data set 
(MRO-M-SHARAD-4-RDR-V1.0) in that a different set of processing 
parameters was used, the details of which are described in the document 
RGRAM_PROCESSING.PDF, in the DOCUMENT directory of the archive.

Future releases of this data set are planned to occur approximately
monthly until the data coverage has caught up with the scheduled 
quarterly releases of MRO data.

To access the above data, please visit:

[NASA] FINAL TEXT FOR EUROPA INSTRUMENT INVESTIGATION RELEASED

The final text for complete PI-led instrument investigations for a 
Europa mission as Appendix O of the Second Stand Alone Missions of 
Opportunity Notice (SALMON-2) via Amendment 8. The term "complete" 
encompasses investigation phases from project initiation, through 
instrument development and science operations, to scientific analysis 
of space based data. It is anticipated that approximately 20 proposals 
will be selected for seven-month, $1.25M (FY 2015) concept studies and 
development. At the conclusion of these studies, NASA may select 
approximately eight of the instrument investigations to complete 
Phase A and subsequent mission phases.

AGU SESSION PS1850 - DYNAMICS OF THE IO-JUPITER SYSTEM (P & SPA 
CO-SPONSORED)

Abstract submission deadline: August 6, 2014

A large coordinated observing campaign in late 2013 and early 2014 has 
probed the Io-Jupiter system at multiple wavelengths using more than a 
dozen ground- and space-based facilities, including the EUV 
spectroscope Hisaki, HST, Chandra, Apache Point, Keck and IRTF. These 
concurrent observations examined Io's volcanic activity, atmosphere and 
plasma torus variability, as well as Jupiter's atmosphere, synchrotron 
emission and auroral dynamics. This session aims to interconnect these 
observations in order to explore the interactions between Io, Jupiter, 
the magnetosphere and the surrounding solar wind. Integrating the 
products of these diverse measurements will help develop a better 
understanding of how mass and energy are transferred through the system 
on different timescales. We invite observers from this campaign to 
report their results and also welcome presentations of relevant models 
and additional data sets.

Conveners:
Sarah Badman (Lancaster University)
Ashley Davies (NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory)
Carl Schmidt (University of Virginia)

Invited Speakers & Preliminary Titles:
Julie Rathbun: Variability of Io's volcanic activity
Kazuo Yoshioka: The Io plasma torus observed by the Hisaki mission
Tomoki Kimura: Multi-wavelength observations of Jupiter's aurora 
coordinated with Hisaki

AGU SESSION PS2526 - EVOLUTIONS, INTERACTIONS AND ORIGINS OF OUTER 
PLANET SATELLITES

Abstract submission deadline: August 6, 2014

This session explores current and past planetary processes that lead 
to unique present day conditions on outer planet satellites. The 
session will consist of invited and contributed talks that highlight 
geological and geophysical modeling and interpretation of both 
remotely-sensed and in-situ data. Presentations on interaction of 
planetary field and plasma with the surfaces and interiors of the 
moons and theoretical models of the origin and evolution of surfaces 
and interiors of the moons are also welcome. Contributions that 
investigate processes on multiple moons to uncover underlying trends 
are especially welcome.

Organized by Krishan Khurana & Amanda Hendrix

AGU SESSION PS2819 - IN AND OUT OF JOVE: GIANT PLANET INTERIORS, 
ATMOSPHERES, AURORAE, AND IONOSPHERES

Abstract submission deadline: August 6, 2014

We solicit new research findings about the ionospheres, atmospheres 
and deep interiors of Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. A special 
focus of our session is on the processes that reflect the interior 
rotation rate of Saturn. The sources of data to be covered in our 
session include the continuing observation by the Cassini spacecraft, 
now in its 10th year in orbit around Saturn. We also cover results of 
the recent Saturn Aurora Campaigns that coordinated observations by 
Cassini, the Hubble Space Telescope, and ground-based observatories. 
For Jupiter, we solicit long-term monitoring using ground- and 
space-based telescopes, and studies in anticipation of the Juno 
spacecraft's arrival in August 2016. Observations of Uranus and Neptune 
are also within in our session's scope. In addition, we solicit 
modeling and theoretical presentations that address these observational 
findings.

AGU SESSION PS3107 - THE MARTIAN CRUST: SYNERGISM OF METEORITES AND 
MISSIONS

Abstract submission deadline: August 6, 2014

Northwest Africa 7034 (and pairings) is the first martian meteorite 
with chemical compositions matching the average martian crust 
determined from mission data. This new unique meteorite is a 
water-rich breccia of Noachian age materials that is providing us an 
unprecedented view of the martian crust. This comes at a time when the 
most advanced Mars rover, Curiosity, is also gathering substantial in 
situ data on martian crustal components. Additionally, more advanced 
techniques are shining new light on our understanding of other martian 
meteorites, while long running missions such as MER continue collecting 
data. We are now poised to greatly expand our knowledge of the martian 
crust and surface processes by combining these new and expanding 
datasets from Earth based samples and Mars based missions. This session 
welcomes abstracts containing new insights regarding the martian crust, 
its history and surface processes, that were determined using data from 
missions and/or meteorite studies.

GSA SESSION - TECTONICS AND VOLCANISM IN THE SOLAR SYSTEM

Abstract submission deadline: July 29, 2014

Volcanism, tectonism, faulting and associated interactions have been 
observed across the solar system and have been shown to have profoundly 
shaped the surfaces of planets, moons and even asteroids. 
Interpretations of these landforms and their formational processes 
will be presented as compared to related processes on Earth. We 
encourage abstract submissions related to the description, mapping, 
modeling and subsequent analysis of tectonic and volcanic structures 
on rocky bodies, including planets, moons and asteroids.
