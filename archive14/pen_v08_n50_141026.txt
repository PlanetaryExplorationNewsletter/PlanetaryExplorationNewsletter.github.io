GERHARD NEUKUM (1944-2014)

Prof. Gerhard Neukum passed away on 21 September 2014. He was one of 
the most prominent planetary researchers in Germany and one of the 
world's recognized experts in the field, focusing on the chronology 
of Solar System bodies.

He was born in 1944 in the Sudetenland, earned his Ph.D. in physics 
on lunar craters at the University of Heidelberg, and received his HDR 
in geophysics and planetary sciences at the University Louis and 
Maximilian in Munich in 1983, where he was appointed extraordinary 
professor in 1989. Since 1997, he occupied the position of professor 
of geosciences at the Free University of Berlin. He also headed the 
Institute of Planetology DLR between 1993 and 2002.

He was instrumental in the birth of ESA's Mars Express Mission, 
instigating the development of the high-resolution stereo camera (HRSC) 
and leading the team of scientists that analyzes the results of this 
experiment. Neukum was also a member of the imaging team of the joint 
ESA-NASA Cassini-Huygens mission, was also involved in the ESA Rosetta 
mission which will land on the comet Churyumov-Gerasimenko in November 
2014 and in NASA's Dawn mission to study the asteroid Vesta and the 
dwarf planet Ceres.

GERRY NEUGEBAUER (1932-2014)

Gerry Neugebauer, an astrophysicist and pioneer of infrared astronomy,
died on Sept. 26 in Arizona. He was a former chairman of the division 
of physics, mathematics and astronomy at the California Institute of 
Technology and director of the Palomar Observatory.

Gerhart Otto Neugebauer was born in Gottingen, Germany, on Sept. 3, 
1932. He later changed his first name to Gerry. He graduated from 
Cornell with a degree in physics and earned a Ph.D. in physics from 
Caltech. From 1960 to 1963, Dr. Neugebauer served in the Army, which 
assigned him to the Jet Propulsion Laboratory where he designed the 
infrared equipment for the Mariner 2 mission to Venus in 1962, and 
then joined Caltech's physics faculty. In 1983, he was the scientific 
director of the Infrared Astronomical Satellite (IRAS), finding more 
than a half-million infrared sources, many of them galaxies and rings 
of debris and dust around stars that were an early clue that planets 
exist beyond Earth's solar system.

Neugebauer was a member of the National Academy of Sciences, and
received the Space Science Award of the American Institute of 
Aeronautics and Astronautics, and the Herschel Medal of the Royal 
Astronomical Society in Britain.

EARTH-LIFE SCIENCE INSTITUTE (ELSI) 3RD INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM

The Earth-Life Science Institute (ELSI) will be holding its 
3rd International Symposium on January 13-15, 2015, in Tokyo, Japan.

The main theme of ELSI's 3rd International Symposium is the fundamental 
question: "Is there life in the Universe, outside Earth?" We still 
don't know the answer, but there is a good chance that the answer will 
be found within our lifetime. Robotic exploration within the solar 
system, as well as observations of planets circling other stars, may 
soon give us more tentative hints, and possibly even convincing 
evidence, of extraterrestrial forms of life. During the 3-day 
symposium, we will address three questions, respectively: 

1) which planets seem fit as potential cradles of life; 
2) what can we say about the likely properties of more universal 
   forms of life, different from the one specific example we know on 
   Earth; and 
3) how can we best try to find signs of life elsewhere.

[NASA] PDS - MARS RECONNAISSANCE ORBITER SHARAD RADARGRAM RELEASE 3

The Planetary Data System (PDS) announces the third release of Mars 
Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO) Shallow Radar (SHARAD) radargram data 
processed by the U.S. members of the SHARAD team. This release includes 
data acquired from September 9, 2010 through May 22, 2013 (orbits 19301 
through 31965). Also included are some data from earlier orbits that 
were missing from previous releases (orbits 7899 through 10703). This 
data set differs from the original SHARAD reduced data set 
(MRO-M-SHARAD-4-RDR-V1.0) in that a different set of processing 
parameters was used, the details of which are described in the document 
RGRAM_PROCESSING.PDF, in the DOCUMENT directory of the archive.

Future releases of this data set are planned to occur approximately 
monthly until the data coverage has caught up with the scheduled 
quarterly releases of MRO data.

To access the above data, please visit:

2ND ANNOUNCEMENT: JWST WORKSHOP AT DPS MEETING

We invite you to participate in a workshop being held at the DPS 
meeting in Tucson, AZ next month to provide community input on 
potential solar system science with JWST. The workshop is being held 
on Sunday, 9 November from 1:00 pm- 4:00 pm (MST), prior to the opening 
reception. Remote participation is also available via WebEx. Details 
can be found at: 

http://www.stsci.edu/jwst/science/solar-system

In order to fully realize the potential of JWST for Solar System 
observations, we have recently organized 10 focus groups including: 
Asteroids, Comets, Giant Planets, Mars, Near Earth Objects, 
Occultations, Rings, Satellites, Titan, and Trans-Neptunian Objects, 
to explore various science use cases in more detail. This workshop 
will consist of: 1) Presentations of findings from the focus groups, 
and 2) Discussion with the broader community to identify gaps in the 
focus-group science use cases and in envisioned observatory 
capabilities. These outputs from the workshop will be used to inform 
ongoing development and pre-launch operational studies. Unique science 
cases are also available as flyers for various Solar System targets 
found here: 

http://www.stsci.edu/jwst/doc-archive/flyers

Your input is essential and we hope you will consider attending this 
workshop next month.

PROPOSAL WRITING WORKSHOP AT DPS
 
Curious about how to improve the quality of the proposals you send to 
NASA? Ever wonder what the review panel is really looking for when it 
reviews that proposal? In conjunction with the DPS workshop on "How to 
be a PI," the Planetary Science Division at NASA Headquarters is 
offering a shortened Proposal Writing Workshop at DPS that is based on 
the cumulative experience of current and former Discipline Scientists 
who have managed a variety of Research and Announcement (R&A) programs 
at NASA Headquarters. The specific focus of this intense, educational 
session is to provide a greater understanding of NASA's review process 
and offer constructive and practical insight into writing an effective 
research proposal. The event is open to all at no charge and will be 
held on Sunday, November 9, from 12-2 pm in Arizona Ballroom 11/12. 
All interested planetary scientists, from graduate students through 
emeritus professors, are encouraged to attend, and the workshop will 
end in time for participants to also attend the "How to be a PI" 
workshop.
 
To register, send an e-mail with your name, affiliation, and current 
position to curt.niebur@nasa.gov.

THE HRSC ORBIT LOCATION EXTRACTOR (HOLE)

http://maps.planet.fu-berlin.de

The planetary sciences and remote sensing group at Freie Universitaet 
Berlin provides a dynamic map-server for easy and fast download of HRSC 
data products. The data can be downloaded in a fluent and intuitive 
zoom-, pan- and click- environment in GeoTiff and GeoJP2000 formats for 
direct integration into GIS projects without time-consuming processing 
work (and skills).

Selectable query layers based on different processing levels of HRSC 
data (level 3 and level 4) are available. Queries are performed by 
selecting orbit outlines from the respective footprint layer. For 
level 4, high-resolution digital terrain models and pan-sharpened 
color composites can be downloaded in GIS-ready formats. For level 3 
data with ortho-rectification being based on MOLA, panchromatic data is 
available. On selection a context window informs the user about basic 
image properties, metadata, previews and direct links to the product 
downloads.

Hill-shaded MOLA datasets in grayscale or color are provided as base 
layers. The mineralogical context can be displayed as transparent 
overlays, based on OMEGA global maps. A three-fourth global HRSC 
panchromatic mosaic allows easier orientation. Further updates are 
planned in the future on a regular basis.
