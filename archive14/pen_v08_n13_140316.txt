EDITORIAL

Mark V. Sykes
Planetary Science Institute

Significant concern has been consistently voiced by the community over 
the restructuring of the planetary research programs in ROSES-14. In 
particular, when the tentative due date of late February 2015 was 
announced for Solar System Workings (SSW, to which 1/3 of all proposals 
to PSD research and data analysis programs are expected to be 
submitted), it was pointed out that scientists across many major 
existing programs would face a gap of ~20 months between proposal calls 
in their areas, with negative impacts if not loss of personnel to the 
profession. In response, the due date was moved forward seven months to 
late July 2014. It appears this was a sham.

Final text for SSW in ROSES-14 says that proposers should plan on 
~1 year for their proposals to be funded. All other planetary programs 
(except one) plan funding ~6 months after proposal submission. One of 
the stated goals of the restructuring was to decrease the time between 
proposal submission and selection. At the recent Planetary Science 
Subcommittee meeting, one NASA official made the remarkable statement 
that the ~6 months for other programs is not meant to be taken 
seriously. 

A one year gap for SSW funding (which could be longer) gives renewed 
weight to a previous accusation that PSD management wished to have the 
option of cutting research funds in FY15 by funding SSW awards in FY16 
(without regard to the consequences to researchers). Such a funding 
shift was admitted as an option by NASA Planetary Science Division 
Director Jim Green at the first R&A Town Hall in December.

PSD management needs to reduce the planned funding date for SSW 
proposals to 6 months after proposals are due and adhere to their own 
standards.

[NASA] ROSES-14 FINAL TEXT FOR HABITABLE WORLDS

The goal of the Habitable Worlds program is to use knowledge of the 
history of the Earth and the life upon it as a guide for determining 
the processes and conditions that create and maintain habitable 
environments and to search for ancient and contemporary habitable 
environments and explore the possibility of extant life beyond the 
Earth.
 
Proposals to this program will be taken by a two-step process, in which 
the Notice of Intent is replaced by a required Step-1 proposal 
submitted by an Authorized Organizational Representative. Only 
proposers who submit a Step-1 proposal are eligible to submit a Step-2 
(full) proposal. Step-1 proposals are due November 24, 2014, and 
Step-2 proposals are due January 23, 2015. Go to:

PLANETARY GIS/DATA SPECIALIST

University of Chicago
Department of Geophysical Sciences

The planetary GIS/data specialist will work in a new Planetary Science
research group led by Edwin Kite in the University of Chicago's
Department of Geophysical Sciences. The central objective of the
research group is to use geologic data to reconstruct the past climate
history of Mars and understand the physical mechanisms responsible for
the loss of Mars habitability. The primary job responsibilities are
(1) to assemble planetary data into "research ready" ArcGIS projected
mosaics, and (2) to generate, evaluate and analyze planetary digital
terrain models that incorporate stereo data. Prior experience, ability 
and agility with ArcGIS is a must, and scripting/programming 
experience is strongly preferred. Funding is secure for 2 years, and 
it is possible that the activities of the group will bring sufficient 
success to sustain renewed engagement.

Salary will be commensurate with the experience and qualifications of
the successful candidate.

A start date in the range 1/1/2015 - 3/31/2015 is preferred. Later
start dates may be negotiated.

NASA POSTDOCTORAL FELLOWSHIPS
 
The NASA Postdoctoral Program (NPP) provides opportunities for 
scientists and engineers to conduct research largely of their own 
choosing, yet compatible with the research opportunities posted on 
the NPP Web site.
 
Selected by a competitive peer-review process, NPP Fellows complete 
one- to three-year Fellowship appointments that advance NASA's 
missions in earth science, heliophysics, planetary science, 
astrophysics, space bioscience, aeronautics and engineering, human 
exploration and space operations, and astrobiology.
 
An example of one of the research opportunities in planetary science 
is:
 
https://www3.orau.gov/NPDoc/Catalog/18624
 
Applicants must have a Ph.D. or equivalent degree in hand before 
beginning the fellowship, but may apply while completing the degree 
requirements. U. S. citizens, Lawful Permanent Residents, and foreign 
nationals eligible for J-1 status as a Research Scholar may apply.
 
Stipends start at $53,500 per year, with supplements for high 
cost-of-living areas and for certain academic specialties. Financial 
assistance is available for relocation and health insurance, and 
$8,000 per year is provided for professional travel.

Applications are accepted three times each year: March 1, July 1, and 
November 1.

CHANGE IN HST SNAP POLICY FOR OBJECTS INTERIOR TO JUPITER

STScI has revised the policy regarding SNAP observations of Solar 
System bodies that lie interior to the orbit of Jupiter. Previously 
such observations were not allowed since scheduling guide-stars 
requires a significant allocation of resources. The policy has been 
changed to allow observations of a subset of these targets provided 
that the observations are undertaken under gyro control. Full details 
are given here:

http://www.stsci.edu/hst/proposing/docs/late-breaking-news#snaps

This change in policy is in effect for Cycle 22 (proposal deadline 
April 11 2014).

[NASA] TECHNOLOGY WORKSHOP FOR THE DISCOVERY 2014 AO FIRST ANNOUNCEMENT

In the up-coming Discovery 2014 Announcement of Opportunity, NASA is 
considering offering as Government-Furnished Equipment a number of 
NASA-developed technologies. In preparation for this, NASA's Science 
Mission Directorate and Space Technology Mission Directorate are 
co-hosting a "Technology Workshop." The goal of this event is to 
educate the potential proposing community on each technology being 
offered and inform how each technology will be supported.

Details of the workshop are being finalized for the week of April 7, 
with a target date of Wednesday, April 9, from 8:30 AM to 6:30 PM. The 
workshop will be divided into two sections: briefings on each 
technology offering in the morning and the opportunity for small-group 
meetings in the afternoon. In order to reach the widest audience 
possible, each briefing will also be webcast.

An invitation will be sent once the details are finalized. Thank you 
in advance for helping to support the 2014 Discovery Announcement of 
Opportunity and advance the use of new technologies for space science.

SOLAR WIND INTERACTION WITH PLUTO WORKSHOP

Wed-Thur August 20-21, 2014
LASP, Boulder CO

In preparation for New Horizons flyby of Pluto around July 2015, the 
above workshop on the solar wind interaction with Pluto's atmosphere 
will focus on current ideas and models of the upstream solar wind 
conditions, the interaction of the surrounding plasma with Pluto's 
escaping atmosphere, and perturbations of the solar wind propagating 
downstream. The workshop will include presentations on plans for 
observations that will be made by and datasets collected by the New 
Horizons Alice (UVS), REX (Radio Science), SWAP (KeV plasma), PEPSSI 
(MeV particles), and SDC (dust counter) instruments.
