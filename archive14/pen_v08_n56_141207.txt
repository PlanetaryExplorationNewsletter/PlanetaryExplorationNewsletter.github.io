EGU 2015 CALL FOR ABSTRACTS: SESSION PS5.1

We invite you to submit an abstract to EGU session PS5.1/ST4.4: 
"Planetary Plasma Physics and Interactions in the Solar System"

Deadline: 7 January 2015

The emphasis of the session is on all aspects of planetary plasma 
physics and interactions in the Solar System, including:

(a) Magnetospheres, ionospheres, auroras
(b) The solar wind interaction with planets, moons, asteroids and 
    comets
(c) Plasma interactions with exospheres, dust and surfaces (e.g. at 
    Mercury, Europa, Ganymede, our Moon, etc.)
(d) Intercomparisons of planetary environments

Contributions are welcome which address previous (e.g. CHANDRAYAAN-1, 
KAGUYA), present (e.g. CASSINI, MARS EXPRESS, MAVEN, VENUS EXPRESS, 
ROSETTA, MESSENGER, CHANG'E 2), forthcoming (e.g. BEPI COLOMBO) and 
planned (e.g. JUICE) observations from space. Analyses of ground-based 
observations of neutral and ionized environments are welcome. 
Theoretical modelling and simulations are also strongly encouraged, 
both in themselves and as a basis for intercomparisons and 
interpretation of measurements. Laboratory studies on planetary 
analogues aiming to simulate the surface-plasma interaction are 
considered as well. 

Participants will be later invited to submit an article in a 
forthcoming dedicated special issue in Planetary and Space Science.

activities are to address NASA's highest lunar and asteroid exploration 
science objectives, including activities in preparation of robotic and 
crewed landings. 

Applications from those with recent Ph.D.s in the fields of petrology 
and geochemistry are encouraged to apply. Previous experience with 
lunar samples, chondritic meteorites, and/or impact lithologies will be 
advantageous, but is not required.

choosing, yet compatible with the research opportunities posted on the 
NPP Web site.

Selected by a competitive peer-review process, NPP Fellows complete 
one- to three-year Fellowship appointments that advance NASA's missions 
in earth science, heliophysics, planetary science, astrophysics, space 
bioscience, aeronautics and engineering, human exploration and space 
operations, and astrobiology.

An example of one of the research opportunities in planetary science 
is:

https://www3.orau.gov/NPDoc/Catalog/18715

Applicants must have a Ph.D. or equivalent degree in hand before 
beginning the fellowship, but may apply while completing the degree 
requirements. U.S. citizens, Lawful Permanent Residents, and foreign 
nationals eligible for J-1 status as a Research Scholar may apply.

Stipends start at $53,500 per year, with supplements for high 
cost-of-living areas and for certain academic specialties. Financial 
assistance is available for relocation and health insurance, and 
$8,000 per year is provided for professional travel.

JOB OPPORTUNITY: STSCI RESEARCH AND INSTRUMENT ANALYSTS

The Space Telescope Science Institute has openings for Research and
Instrument Analysts (RIA) in our Instruments Division. RIAs will
assist Instrument Scientists in the reduction and analysis of Hubble
Space Telescope calibration data. Analysts will also assist in the
development and testing of the scientific instruments and optical
systems for the James Webb Space Telescope. They will provide user
support to HST General Observers and Archival Researchers in various
aspects of observation planning and data reduction. Additionally,
analysts may become involved in cutting-edge astronomical research by
providing support for scientific programs of staff scientists. Such
support can involve calibrating data, photometry, spectroscopy, image
drizzling, coding, and laboratory work in astronomical instrumentation.

Successful applicants typically have a Bachelor's, Master's or a
recent PhD degree in Astronomy, Physics, Astrophysics, Planetary
Science, or related fields. The starting position (RIA I, II, Senior)
and salary are commensurate with education and experience. Experience
with astronomical research, instrumentation or optics, scientific
computing, data analysis, and IRAF or other astronomical software
packages, is also desired. Additional mathematical, statistical, and
programming skills (e.g. IDL, python) are a plus.

Applications due: January 31, 2015
