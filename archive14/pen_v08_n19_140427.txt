[NASA] PLANETARY SCIENCE DIVISION SEEKING VOLUNTEER REVIEWERS

To increase the pool of un-conflicted reviewers the Planetary Science 
Division is seeking subject matter experts to serve as mail-in 
reviewers of proposals and/or in-person reviewers to engage in 
discussions at a face-to-face panel meeting. New researchers 
(including post-doctoral fellows) are welcome to apply as they provide 
fresh insight from people close to the most current research. Just 
follow the links below to the volunteer review forms and indicate the 
fields in which you consider yourself to be a subject matter expert 
and click the boxes. If your skills match our needs for this review 
NASA will contact you to discuss scheduling.     

We are currently seeking reviewers for:

ROSES 2014 E.3 The Exoplanet Research Program
ROSES 2014 C.2 Emerging Worlds

LINDA SHORE CHOSEN AS NEW EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE ASTRONOMICAL 
SOCIETY OF THE PACIFIC

Linda Shore, a nationally recognized science educator and author, has 
been named the Executive Director of the Astronomical Society of the 
Pacific (ASP), the largest and most active scientific society 
specifically devoted to astronomy education and outreach. Dr. Shore 
takes over the management of the international Society, headquartered 
in San Francisco, during the celebration of its 125th anniversary. 
 
She is the first woman in the society's history to hold this post.
 
For over 20 years, Shore served as Director of the Teacher Institute 
at the Exploratorium, San Francisco's renowned hands-on science museum. 
While there, she spearheaded several successful initiatives, including 
the first beginning science teacher training program in the country. 
She and her staff trained thousands of teachers from around the 
country, improving both their content knowledge and classroom 
practices. During her time at the Exploratorium, Shore was co-author 
of the award-winning Science Explorer series of activity books for 
families, published by Henry Holt.

[NASA] ROSES-14: FINAL TEXT FOR PDART

The Planetary Data Archiving, Restoration, and Tools (PDART) solicits 
proposals to generate higher-order data products, archive and restore 
data sets or products, create or consolidate reference databases, 
digitize data, and develop or validate software tools.
 
The objective of this program element is to increase the amount and 
quality of archived data and data products available for planetary 
science research and exploration and to produce tools that would 
enable or enhance future scientific investigations. Although it is 
expected that a small amount of data analysis or modeling may be 
performed to validate any generated products, this program element 
does not accept proposals in which the main focus is a scientific 
investigation.
 
Only proposers who submit a Step-1 proposal (due July 14, 2014) are 
eligible to submit a Step-2 (full) proposal (due September 12, 2014).

NASA POSTDOCTORAL FELLOWSHIPS
 
The NASA Postdoctoral Program (NPP) provides opportunities for 
scientists and engineers to conduct research largely of their own 
choosing, yet compatible with the research opportunities posted on the 
NPP Web site.
 
Selected by a competitive peer-review process, NPP Fellows complete 
one- to three-year Fellowship appointments that advance NASA's missions 
in earth science, heliophysics, planetary science, astrophysics, space 
bioscience, aeronautics and engineering, human exploration and space 
operations, and astrobiology.
 
An example of one of the research opportunities in planetary science 
is:
 
https://www3.orau.gov/NPDoc/Catalog/17656
 
Applicants must have a Ph.D. or equivalent degree in hand before 
beginning the fellowship, but may apply while completing the degree 
requirements. U. S. citizens, Lawful Permanent Residents, and 
foreign nationals eligible for J-1 status as a Research Scholar may 
apply.
 
Stipends start at $53,500 per year, with supplements for high 
cost-of-living areas and for certain academic specialties. 
Financial assistance is available for relocation and health 
insurance, and $8,000 per year is provided for professional travel.

Applications are accepted three times each year: March 1, July 1, and 
November 1.

WORKSHOP ON THE STUDY OF ICE GIANT PLANETS

July 28-30, 2014
APL
Laurel, MD

Abstract submission and registration are now open for the Workshop on 
the Study of the Ice Giant Planets July 28-30 at APL in Laurel, MD.  
The abstracts deadline is May 15 and early registration runs through 
June 27. For more information, please see:

JPL REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL TO MODEL EUROPA PLUMES 

https://acquisition.jpl.nasa.gov/bizops

Recent Hubble Space Telescope (HST) detection of anomalous 
concentrations of hydrogen and oxygen at Europa could potentially be 
due to plumes, analogous to the well-characterized plume at Enceladus 
as observed by the Cassini mission. Plumes on Europa would be extremely 
interesting science and mission targets, particularly due to the unique 
opportunity to obtain direct information on the subsurface composition, 
thereby addressing Europa's potential habitability. In this context, a 
better understanding of the density and compositional structure of 
potential Europa plumes would help in planning of science observations 
for the Europa Clipper mission concept. Moreover, understanding the 
density structure of plumes is important to understanding potential 
engineering concerns due to dust as well as the potential effects of 
drag on the spacecraft. JPL seeks proposals that would model Europa 
plumes, including their possible physical properties and 
three-dimensional dynamics. We anticipate up to $450 K total funding 
will be available for 5 - 8 successful proposals. This is anticipated 
as a 9 to 12 month task, beginning around July 2014. 

Deadline: Thursday, May 27, 2014, 3:00 p.m. (PST).

SOLAR WIND INTERACTION WITH PLUTO WORKSHOP

Wednesday-Thursday, August 20-21, 2014
LASP, Boulder CO

In preparation for New Horizons flyby of Pluto around July 2015, the 
above workshop on the solar wind interaction with Pluto's atmosphere 
will focus on current ideas and models of the upstream solar wind 
conditions, the interaction of the surrounding plasma with Pluto's 
escaping atmosphere, and perturbations of the solar wind propagating 
downstream.

The workshop will include presentations on plans for observations that 
will be made by and datasets collected by the New Horizons Alice (UVS), 
REX (Radio Science), SWAP (KeV plasma), PEPSSI (MeV particles), and SDC 
(dust counter) instruments. Go to:

human and robotic missions at all destinations.
 
A focus on human activities at each of these potential destinations and 
abstracts are solicited on the following topics:
 
- Lunar Surface Presence
- Moon's role in further exploration destinations (cis-lunar space, NEA, 
  Mars)
- Human - Robotic Interaction
- Building International Partnerships
- Role of the Commercial Sector
 
Please submit abstracts for this special session under the drop-down 
menu called "Human Exploration and Destination Drivers" on the Forum 
website.
