THE 65TH INTERNATIONAL ASTRONAUTICAL CONGRESS IN TORONTO, CANADA

NASA announces its intent to participate in the 65th International 
Astronautical Congress (IAC) and requests that full-time graduate 
students attending U.S. universities or colleges respond to this "Call

Astronautical Federation (IAF), the International Academy of 
Astronautics (IAA), and the International Institute of Space Law 
(IISL) – is the largest space-related conference world-wide and selects 
an average of 1000 scientific papers every year. The upcoming IAC will 
be held September 29-October 3, 2014 in Toronto Canada. NASA's 
participation in this event is an on-going effort to continue to bridge 
NASA with the astronautical and space international community.
 
For more information, see:

http://www.iafastro.com/index.php/events/iac/iac-2014

SESSION ON "PLANETARY SURFACE PROCESSES" AT NEXT RST MEETING

A session on "Planetary Surface Processes" is scheduled at the next 
Reunion des Sciences de la Terre (RST) (27-31 October 2014, Pau, 
France). Contributions from the international planetology community 
are welcome. Abstract submission for this session is now open until 
15 May: 

http://rst2014-pau.sciencesconf.org/

NASA POSTDOCTORAL FELLOWSHIPS
 
The NASA Postdoctoral Program (NPP) provides opportunities for 
scientists and engineers to conduct research largely of their own 
choosing, yet compatible with the research opportunities posted on the 
NPP Web site.
 
Selected by a competitive peer-review process, NPP Fellows complete 
one- to three-year Fellowship appointments that advance NASA’s missions 
in earth science, heliophysics, planetary science, astrophysics, space 
bioscience, aeronautics and engineering, human exploration and space 
operations, and astrobiology.
 
An example of one of the research opportunities in planetary science 
is:
 
https://www3.orau.gov/NPDoc/Catalog/17701   
 
Applicants must have a Ph.D. or equivalent degree in hand before 
beginning the fellowship, but may apply while completing the degree 
requirements. U. S. citizens, Lawful Permanent Residents, and foreign 
nationals eligible for J-1 status as a Research Scholar may apply.
 
Stipends start at $53,500 per year, with supplements for high cost-
of-living areas and for certain academic specialties. Financial 
assistance is available for relocation and health insurance, and 
$8,000 per year is provided for professional travel.

Applications are accepted three times each year: March 1, July 1, 
and November 1.

ASTEROIDS, COMETS, METEORS 2014 (ACM'2014)

June 30 - July 4, 2014
Helsinki, Finland

Call for abstracts and registration.

Asteroids, Comets, Meteors focuses on the research of small Solar 
System bodies. Small bodies are the key to understanding the formation 
and evolution of the Solar System, carrying signals from pre-solar 
times. Understanding the evolution of the Solar System helps unveil 
the evolution of extrasolar planetary systems. Societally, small bodies 
will be important future resources of minerals. The near-Earth 
population of small bodies continues to pose an impact hazard, whether 
it be small pieces of falling meteorites or larger asteroids or 
cometary nuclei capable of causing global environmental effects. The 
conference series entitled "Asteroids, Comets, Meteors" constitutes 
the leading international series in the field of small Solar System 
bodies.

The ACM'2014 Call for Abstracts and Registration is now open at:

http://www.helsinki.fi/acm2014/

Abstracts and registration are due by March 31, 2014.

Looking forward to seeing you in Helsinki!

SHARAD/MARSIS Data Users' Workshop - 45th LPSC

The SHARAD/MARSIS Data Users' Workshop is tentatively scheduled for 
Sunday, March 16, 2014 (before the 45th LPSC) from 3-7 PM at The 
Woodlands, Texas, Waterway Marriott Hotel and Convention Center. 

The Workshop is hosted by the SHARAD & MARSIS science teams; by the 
Radar Lab, DIET Dept., Sapienza University of Rome; and by the PDS 
Geosciences Node. It is sponsored by the University of Texas Institute 
of Geophysics. 

Radar sounding data from the SHARAD instrument on MRO and the MARSIS 
instrument on Mars Express have provided a wealth of information on 
the near-subsurface of Mars. This workshop will:

Provide an introduction to the radar data and explain how to:

- access the data in various forms,
- locate the data on the planet and pick new targets, 
- process SHARAD data through a user-friendly Web interface,
- discriminate between subsurface returns and surface clutter, and
- use software tools to map subsurface reflectors, 

There is no registration fee; however, attendees are required to 
register at the Workshop website: 

http://www.ig.utexas.edu/sharad_marsis/ 

Please check this website frequently for further details and the 
program posting.

MARS CRITICAL DATA PRODUCTS PROGRAM (ROUND IX) -  MARS 2020

Initial Landing Site Characterization for the Mars 2020 Rover Mission
 
The Mars Exploration Program has issued, in January 2014, a Request for 
Proposal for round IX of the Mars Critical Data Products program.  This 
RFP provides support for initial landing site surface, atmosphere, and 
gravity characterization for the Mars 2020 rover mission. The intent is 
to convert mission data and numerical simulations into products focused 
on specific landing site targets (to be provided by the program) that 
will be useful for reducing the risk to the Mars 2020 rover mission. 
Proposals are due on Wednesday, March 5, 2014.
 
Details of the RFPs are posted at:

CALL FOR PAPERS: VENUS SCIENCE AND EXPLORATION

Dear Colleagues,

We invite submissions of papers related to Venus science and 
exploration for a Special Issue of Planetary and Space Science. We 
particularly solicit papers arising from the International Venus 
Conference held in Catania in June 2013, but further papers not 
presented at that conference are very welcome.

Submission for this journal is via: 

http://ees.elsevier.com/pss/default.asp

To ensure that all manuscripts are correctly identified for inclusion 
into the special issue, please select "SI: Exploration of Venus" when 
you reach the "Article Type" step in the submission process.

Deadline for submission for this Special Issue will be 28 February
2014, but of course we welcome earlier submissions!

Please feel free to distribute this announcement widely.

of our Solar System, the Kuiper Belt.  You can help bring a LEGO© 
version of the New Horizons spacecraft to life.  If enough votes are 
received at:

http://lego.cuusoo.com/ideas/view/44093
