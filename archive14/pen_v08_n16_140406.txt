FIRST LANDING SITE WORKSHOP FOR THE 2020 ROVER MISSION TO MARS

This is a reminder that the First Landing Site Workshop for the 2020 
rover mission to Mars will be held May 14-16, 2014. The workshop will 
be held at the Crystal City Marriott, 1999 Jefferson Davis Highway, 
in Arlington, VA (703-413-5500) and will follow the MEPAG meeting 
scheduled for the same venue.

Persons wishing to participate should communicate with both Matt 
Golombek (mgolombek@jpl.nasa.gov) and John Grant (grantj@si.edu).
[The abstract deadline was April 4.]
 
Most of the workshop will be devoted to: (1) the overall types of 
sites for Mars 2020 based on associated scientific and programmatic 
rationale and suitability for safe landing and roving; and 
(2) individual landing sites on Mars and their scientific merit and 
safety. The complete call for the workshop and more information on 
science objectives and preliminary engineering requirements are at: 

http://marsnext.jpl.nasa.gov/.

[NASA] PDS - GRAIL RELEASE 4

The Planetary Data System (PDS) announces the fourth release of 
Gravity Recovery and Interior Laboratory (GRAIL) data:

- LGRS EDR - Raw science data originating from the Lunar Gravity 
  Ranging System (LGRS) on each of the two spacecraft comprising the 
  GRAIL mission.
- LGRS CDR - Calibrated and resampled data from the LGRS on each of the 
  two spacecraft comprising the GRAIL mission.
- RSS EDR - Raw radio science data and ancillary files from the GRAIL 
  mission.

This release comprises data from both the primary and extended mission 
phases and includes version 4 of LGRS EDR and CDR data, along with 
revisions to some RSS EDR data. It is also the first release of RSS EDR 
data from all other mission phases. New data products include wheel

[NASA] LUNAR DATA ANALYSIS PROGRAM

Final text for the Lunar Data Analysis Program is now released. 

The Lunar Data Analysis Program (LDAP) program funds research on the 
analysis of recent lunar missions in order to enhance their scientific 
return. LDAP broadens scientific participation in the analysis of 
mission data sets and funds high-priority areas of research that 
support planning for future lunar missions. 
 
The final text replaces the prior placeholder text in its entirety. 
Proposals to this program will be taken by a two-step process, in which 
the Notice of Intent is replaced by a required Step-1 proposal 
submitted by an organization Authorized Organizational Representative. 
Only proposers who submit a Step-1 proposal are eligible to submit a 
Step-2 (full) proposal. See Section 2.3 for details. Step-1 proposals 
are due August 29, 2014, and Step-2 proposals are due October 24, 2014.

EPSC SESSION MT13: PLANETARY SCIENCE WITH THE JAMES WEBB SPACE 
TELESCOPE (JWST)

European Planetary Science Congress 2014 (September 7-12) will have a 
special session (MT13) on Planetary Science with the James Webb Space 
Telescope (JWST).

Convener: P. Ferruit

Scheduled for launch in October 2018, the James Webb Space Telescope 
(JWST) will be one of the major space observatories of the next 
decade. JWST and its instrument suite will allow planetary scientists 
and astronomers to perform imaging and spectroscopy over the 0.6 to 28 
micron range with unprecedented  sensitivity. JWST is designed to 
observe solar system objects beyond earth orbit having apparent rates 
of motion up to 30 milliarcseconds/second, i.e. planets, satellites, 
asteroids, trans-neptunian objects and comets. JWST will also allow to 
look beyond our solar system and to study exo-planets.

This session will be dedicated to presentations of planetary science 
(both in our solar system and in other stellar system) that could be 
conducted with JWST. 

Abstracts are due May 6, 2014.

JWST SSWG WHITE PAPER: SOLAR SYSTEM OBSERVATIONS WITH JWST

The JWST Solar System Working Group has released "Solar System 
Observations with JWST" by Norwood et al.

Abstract: The James Webb Space Telescope will enable a wealth of new 
scientific investigations in the near- and mid-infrared, with 
sensitivity and spatial/spectral resolution greatly surpassing its 
predecessors. In this paper, we focus upon Solar System science 
facilitated by JWST, discussing the most current information available 
concerning JWST instrument properties and observing techniques relevant 
to planetary science. We also present numerous example observing 
scenarios for a wide variety of Solar System targets to illustrate the 
potential of JWST science to the Solar System community. This paper 
updates and supersedes the Solar System white paper published by the 
JWST Project in 2010 (Lunine et al., 2010). It is based both on that 
paper and on a workshop held at the annual meeting of the Division for 
Planetary Sciences in Reno, NV in 2012. 

Please find the Solar System White Paper at:

Justification and Observation Requirements" by Tiscareno et al. is also 
now available at:

NASA POSTDOCTORAL FELLOWSHIPS
 
The NASA Postdoctoral Program (NPP) provides opportunities for 
scientists and engineers to conduct research largely of their own 
choosing, yet compatible with the research opportunities posted on the 
NPP Web site.
 
Selected by a competitive peer-review process, NPP Fellows complete 
one- to three-year Fellowship appointments that advance NASA's missions 
in earth science, heliophysics, planetary science, astrophysics, space 
bioscience, aeronautics and engineering, human exploration and space 
operations, and astrobiology.
 
An example of one of the research opportunities in planetary science 
is:
 
https://www3.orau.gov/NPDoc/Catalog/18314
 
Applicants must have a Ph.D. or equivalent degree in hand before 
beginning the fellowship, but may apply while completing the degree 
requirements. U. S. citizens, Lawful Permanent Residents, and foreign 
nationals eligible for J-1 status as a Research Scholar may apply.
 
Stipends start at $53,500 per year, with supplements for high 
cost-of-living areas and for certain academic specialties. Financial 
assistance is available for relocation and health insurance, and $8,000 
per year is provided for professional travel.

Applications are accepted three times each year: March 1, July 1, and 
November 1.

LARRY SODERBLOM'S 70TH BIRTHDAY

Dear Friends.

We invite you to a celebration in honor of Larry Soderblom's 70th 
birthday, to occur Sunday, July 20th at the Arizona Snowbowl, in 
Flagstaff, AZ.

We are planning a one-day symposium highlighting Larry's involvement 
in our exploration of the Solar System and the history of the USGS 
Astrogeology Science Center, followed by an evening of dining, 
chatting, and roasting. We anticipate that the day's food will cost on 
order of $50 per person. If you are interested in attending, please 
RSVP at:
