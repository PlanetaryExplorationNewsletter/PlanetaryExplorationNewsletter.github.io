[NASA] ROSES-14: DAWN AT CERES GIP

The goals of the Dawn at Ceres Guest Investigator Program are to: 
a) enhance the scientific return from the Dawn mission by broadening 
   participation in the mission 
b) augment the existing Dawn science team to include new members 
   conducting investigations that broaden and/or complement the funded 
   Principal Investigator (PI) and Co-Investigator (Co-I)-led 
   investigations, thus maximizing the contribution of Dawn to the 
   future exploration and scientific understanding of the Solar System. 
   Because the intention is to enhance and broaden the scientific 
   return, investigations submitted by Dawn PIs and Co-Is will not be 
   considered. Individuals previously selected as Dawn at Vesta 
   Participating Scientists may propose new investigations to this 
   solicitation.

Step-1 due: August 14, 2014

GSA SESSION ANNOUNCEMENT - WHEN WATER MEETS ROCK: AQUEOUS ALTERATION 
IN THE SOLAR SYSTEM

Water-rock chemical interactions are ubiquitous on surfaces and in 
shallow crusts of planetary bodies, and in chondritic materials. 
This session will explore processes and products of aqueous 
alteration and we encourage contributions from terrestrial analog 
studies. 

Chemical reactions between rock and water have played a fundamental 
role throughout solar system history, but we are often left with the 
products of these interactions (e.g., hydrated minerals, geochemical 
fingerprints) and left to interpret the processes and environments 
responsible. For example on Mars, thousands of detections of hydrous 
minerals by the CRISM spectrometer point to a wetter history around 
the same time life arose on Earth. Carbonaceous chondrites, the most 
chemically primitive solar system materials, are typified by nearly 
complete alteration of their primary mineralogy through the action of 
water. Linking observed secondary minerals and geochemistry with 
formation environment and process is the focus of this session. Big 
picture questions include whether observed aqueous minerals formed 
mainly under near-surface ambient or hydrothermal conditions and the 
longevity of liquid water involved. 

The abstract deadline is July 29.

GEOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA G.K. GILBERT AWARD: GEOPHYSICS ACROSS 
THE OUTER SOLAR SYSTEM

Exploration of our Solar System over the past decades has revealed the 
pervasive importance of a myriad of geophysical processes on the icy
bodies beyond the asteroid belt. Understanding the relative importance 
of large impacts, orbital dynamics, and internal processes for 
tectonics and other surface modifications is key to untangling the 
evolution of these objects where water ice is a major, and in many 
cases dominant, constituent. Besides revealing evidence of these 
processes, spacecraft data have enabled the rigorous modeling of these 
icy bodies' internal structures, convection in their icy mantles, 
viscous relaxation of impact crater topography, water-rich volcanism, 
and cratering mechanics into ice by providing critical topographic and 
morphological constraints. These discoveries have also provided 
evidence for surface processes distinctive to the low-gravity, icy 
bodies in the outer Solar System. To celebrate and further understand 
these discoveries, this session will explore the origin, structure, 
evolution, and bombardment history of outer planet satellites and 
Pluto.

The due date for GSA abstracts is July 29. The G.K. Gilbert session 
will be held at the GSA Annual Meeting on Tuesday, Oct 21, in 
Vancouver, BC.

The session is in honor of Prof. William McKinnon, the 2014 G.K. 
Gilbert awardee.

AGU SESSION PS2603: FROM OBSERVATIONS TO THE GLOBAL IGNEOUS EVOLUTION 
OF MARS

Recent research places us on the cusp to advance planetary-scale 
martian evolution. These include mugearite, identified in situ, 
indicating a compositional parallel to otherwise unlikely arc and 
rift processes; geomorphology suggesting Yellowstone-scale volcanic 
edifices; meteorites, such as NWA9034, showing the first compelling 
overlap with crustal composition; evidence for isolated pockets of 
a wet ancient mantle active until recently; localized spectral 
signatures of unusually felsic compositions; and igneous evolution 
models such as thermal pipes. Accordingly, this session will address 
emerging questions. For example, did thermal pipe analogs contribute 
an endogenic source for the planetary dichotomy? Could pyroclastics 
and exhalations, of supervolcanoes tapping a mantle, hydrated 
comparably with modern Earth's, yield compositional signatures in the 
modern crust? What constraints on magma ocean overturn and 
lithospheric de-lamination models might arise by seeking evidence 
for a residual primary crust? We welcome contributions from both 
planetary and terrestrial geologists to address such interdisciplinary 
questions.

AGU SESSION PS 2692: RAPID ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE AND THE FATE OF 
PLANETARY HABITABILITY

Rapid environmental change can be used as a scientific bridge, 
relating astrobiology to earth, planetary, and space sciences in the 
study of how life may adapt through abrupt climate crises. Recent 
discoveries inspire us to re-examine our understanding of how rapidly 
planetary habitats can be redistributed. Past habitable environments 
on Mars from the Curiosity rover, possible subsurface lakes and oceans 
on Europa or Enceladus, and potentially habitable exoplanets from the 
Kepler spacecraft continue to expand our definition of the habitable 
zone. Abstracts on the intertwined aspects of changing habitability, 
including the complex interactions among astronomical, geological, 
and climatic forces, on the Earth and beyond, are welcome.

AGU SESSION PS2919: IN AND OUT OF JOVE - GIANT PLANET INTERIORS, 
ATMOSPHERES, AURORAE, AND IONOSPHERES

We solicit new research findings about the ionospheres, atmospheres 
and deep interiors of Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. A special 
focus of our session is on the processes that reflect the interior 
rotation rate of Saturn. The sources of data to be covered in our 
session include the continuing observation by the Cassini spacecraft, 
now in its 10th year in orbit around Saturn. We also cover results of 
the recent Saturn Aurora Campaigns that coordinated observations by 
Cassini, the Hubble Space Telescope, and ground-based observatories. 
For Jupiter, we solicit long-term monitoring using ground- and space-
based telescopes, and studies in anticipation of the Juno spacecraft's 
arrival in August 2016. Observations of Uranus and Neptune are also 
within in our session's scope. In addition, we solicit modeling and 
theoretical presentations that address these observational findings.

AGU SESSION PS3439: RECONSTRUCTING HABITABLE ENVIRONMENTS ON ANCIENT 
MARS

Calling all martian geomorphologists, geochemists, sedimentologists,
mineralogists, and astrobiologists for a collaborative session on
habitability and organic preservation on ancient Mars!

Ongoing rover and satellite investigations of the martian surface have
revealed diverse aqueous environments, but these environments most
likely had highly variable implications for habitability and organic
preservation potential. The wealth of geomorphological, chemical, and
mineralogical data available at Mars now allows us to reconstruct
these environments in detail at sites across the planet, by inferring
environmental conditions including (but not limited to): pH, redox
state, environmental stability, radiation shielding, longevity of
aqueous activity, and diversity of possible metabolic pathways.

As habitability and preservation potential are the primary
characteristics that will drive NASA's continued exploration of Mars,
this session will focus on using inferred environmental conditions to
evaluate both of these characteristics at geological sites relevant to
ancient Mars. We invite abstracts using data from landed and/or
satellite missions, and encourage abstracts that address possible
ExoMars and Mars2020 landing sites.

AGU SESSION PS3594: THE SOLAR SYSTEM COLLAPSING DISC - EVIDENCE FROM 
COMETS, METEORITES AND GIANT PLANET ATMOSPHERES 

For several decades evaluations of the composition of meteorites, 
comets and giant planet atmospheres have provided clues to the origin 
and evolution of the solar system. When combined with theories on 
dynamics and composition of the collapsing disc, a picture of the 
history of the solar system unfolds. Several recent NASA and ESA 
missions, including Rosetta, JUNO, Dawn and New Horizons will soon 
add to constraints on the origin and evolution of our solar system.  
Furthermore, recent laboratory studies provide important results for 
evaluation of these measurements. The goal of this session is to put 
previous work and upcoming measurements into the broader context of 
solar system formation and evolution. This session is open to papers 
on comet, meteorite and giant planet atmosphere contributions to 
understanding solar system origins, laboratory studies related to the 
topic, and theoretical studies of the dynamical and chemical evolution 
of the collapsing disc.

The abstract deadline for all submissions is 6 August 23:59 
EDT/03:59 +1 GMT and no abstracts will be accepted after this date.

AGU SESSION PS3960: SOLAR SYSTEM SMALL BODIES - RELICS OF FORMATION & 
NEW WORLDS TO EXPLORE

The composition and physical properties of Small Solar System Bodies 
(SSSBs), remnants of the formation of planets, are key to better 
understand the origins of our solar system and their potential as 
resources is necessary for robotic and human exploration. Missions 
such as ESA/Gaia, NASA/OSIRIS-REx, JAXA/Hyabusa-2, NASA/Dawn and 
NASA/New Horizons, to study asteroids, comets, dwarf planets and 
TNOs are poised to provide new in situ information. on SSSBs.  Recent 
remote observations of bright and main belt comets; asteroid Chariklo, 
with its ring system; asteroid and KBO binaries illustrate that the 
distinction between comets and asteroids is blurred, providing a new 
paradigm for such classification. This session welcomes abstracts on 
the remarkable results bringing information on the internal structure 
and composition of SSSBs based on space and ground-based data, 
numerical models, as well as instrument/mission concepts in the 
prospect of future exploration.

REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS - MARS ONE LANDER 2019

Mars One is extending a formal invitation to universities, research 
bodies, and companies to contribute to the payload of the 2019 unmanned 
Mars Lander. The best ideas will be chosen by a panel of experts. 
This mission will act as a staging point for the first-ever human 
mission to the red planet in 2025.

Mars One is soliciting proposals for four demonstration payloads that 
will demonstrate technologies for the human mission in 2025, proposals 
for one payload that will be elected in a world wide university 
competition, and proposals for two payloads that are for sale to the 
highest bidder. These last two payloads can be used for scientific 
experiments, marketing activities or anything in between.

The payloads will be part of the Mars One lander that will be launched 
in August 2019. The lander will be built on the same platform that was 
used for the 2009 NASA Phoenix mission. Mars One contracted Lockheed 
Martin, who also built the Phoenix spacecraft, to develop the mission 
concept study for the 2019 lander.
