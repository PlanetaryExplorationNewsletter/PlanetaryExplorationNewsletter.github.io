MARS MAGNETIC FIELDS AND UPPER ATMOSPHERE POSTDOCTORAL RESEARCHERS 
(NASA-GSFC/CRESST/UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND)

Applications are now being accepted for two Postdoctoral Research 
Associates, funded through the University of Maryland College Park 
(UMCP) and the Center for Research and Exploration in Space Science 
and Technology (CRESST), to work in the Planetary Magnetospheres 
Laboratory of the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) in the 
area of Mars magnetic fields and upper atmosphere investigations 
using data from the MAVEN mission. Additional details are 
available at:

http://www.astro.umd.edu/employment/

Candidates for either position should have a Ph.D. in a relevant 
discipline with prior experience conducting scientific research 
related to the Maven science objectives or the types of instruments 
included in the MAVEN science payload. IDL skills and experience 
in acquisition and analysis of data from space flight instruments 
are highly desirable.

The University of Maryland is an equal opportunity employer. All 
applications received by May 23, 2014 will receive full consideration.

NEO POSTDOC POSITION AT LOWELL OBSERVATORY

Applications are invited for a postdoctoral position at Lowell 
Observatory to work on the physical characterization of near-Earth 
objects. This position will be co-supervised by Drs. Nicholas 
Moskovitz and Will Grundy.

The initial appointment is for one year with automatic extension 
to two years in the case of satisfactory progress. Extension to 
three years may be possible depending on availability of funding. 
The position is expected to be split with 80% of the time dedicated 
to the main program and 20% for research of the postdoc's choice. 
The start date is negotiable, but preference is for late summer 2014. 
This position is funded by a NASA NEOO grant and comes with a 
competitive salary and full benefits. A PhD in physics, astronomy, 
planetary science, or a related field is required by the start date.

Application available at:

http://www.lowell.edu/documents/LowellEmploymentApplication-v07-13.pdf

Send to humanresources@lowell.edu along with a single PDF document 
incorporating the following:
* A cover letter
* A Curriculum Vitae
* A Statement of past research accomplishments and future research 
  goals (3 pages or less)
* Phone numbers and e-mail addresses of three references

Applications will be reviewed beginning June 15, 2014.

NASA POSTDOCTORAL FELLOWSHIPS

The NASA Postdoctoral Program (NPP) provides opportunities for 
scientists and engineers to conduct research largely of their own 
choosing, yet compatible with the research opportunities posted on 
the NPP Web site.

Selected by a competitive peer-review process, NPP Fellows complete 
one- to three-year Fellowship appointments that advance NASA's 
missions in earth science, heliophysics, planetary science, 
astrophysics, space bioscience, aeronautics and engineering, human 
exploration and space operations, and astrobiology.

A sample opportunity in planetary science is:

https://www3.orau.gov/NPDoc/Catalog/18395

Applicants must have a Ph.D. or equivalent degree in hand before 
beginning the fellowship, but may apply while completing the degree 
requirements. U. S. citizens, Lawful Permanent Residents, and foreign 
nationals eligible for J-1 status as a Research Scholar may apply.

Stipends start at $53,500 per year, with supplements for high cost-
of-living areas and for certain academic specialties. Financial 
assistance is available for relocation and health insurance, and 
$8,000 per year is provided for professional travel.

Applications are accepted three times each year: March 1, July 1, 
and November 1.
