RELEASE OF SOFIA CYCLE 3 CALL FOR PROPOSALS

The Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy (SOFIA) is pleased
to invite proposals for Cycle 3 observations, which will take place 
in the time period March 1, 2015 to January 31, 2016. The observing 
campaigns will be interspersed with aircraft maintenance and instrument 
commissioning.

The deadline for submitting proposals is July 18, 2014. 
Proposal selections will be announced in early October 2014. 

Details of the Cycle 3 Call for Proposals can be found at: 

http://www.sofia.usra.edu/Science/proposals/cycle3/

SOFIA is a 2.7-m telescope, with an effective, unvignetted, diameter 
of 2.5-m, housed in a Boeing 747-SP aircraft. Observations are 
typically carried out at altitudes between 11.9 km (39,000 ft) 
and 13.7 km (45,000 ft.). These altitudes place the observatory 
above up to 99.8% of the obscuring atmospheric water vapor. There 
are six observatory instruments offered in this Call, which cover 
the range 0.3-250 microns.

Due to uncertainties in the NASA budget and the SOFIA project 
allocation for Fiscal Year 2015 and beyond, the implementation of 
this Call is contingent on the budget appropriation for the SOFIA 
project for that time period.

Questions, please contact sofia_help@sofia.usra.edu.

AIDA WORKSHOP: HOLD THE DATE!

The first International Asteroid Impact Deflection Assessment 
(AIDA) Workshop will be held 16-17 October 2014 in the Washington 
DC area. We will discuss the science and planetary defense aspects 
of an asteroid deflection by kinetic impactor, focusing on the DART 
(Double Asteroid Redirection Test) and AIM (Asteroid Impact Mission) 
concepts under consideration by NASA and ESA. The combination of both 
missions is referred to as AIDA. As such we will include presentations 
of those two concepts, discussion of the Didymos binary system, the 
target of AIDA , as well as a more general discussion on binary 
systems, regolith characteristics and mechanics, internal structures 
of asteroids, impact observing strategies, additional science 
opportunities during an impact demonstration, and "next steps" for 
future deflection tests.

LUNAR AND SMALL BODIES GRADUATE CONFERENCE 2014 - SECOND ANNOUNCEMENT 
AND ABSTRACT SUBMISSION DEADLINE

Registration is now open for the 5th Annual Lunar and Small Bodies 
Graduate Conference (LunGradCon 2014) to be held on 
Sunday, July 20, 2014 at the NASA Ames Research Center, preceding the 
NASA Exploration Science Forum (ESF). With the expanded interests of 
the Solar System Exploration Research Virtual Institute (SSERVI), 
the scope of this year's LunGradCon is also expanding to include both 
lunar and small bodies science. LunGradCon provides an opportunity 
for grad students and early-career postdocs to present their 
research on lunar and small body science in a low-stress, friendly 
environment, being critiqued only by their peers. In addition to oral 
presentations, the conference presents opportunities for 
professional development and networking with fellow grad students and 
postdocs, as well as senior members of SSERVI. A limited amount of 
funding will be provided for travel and lodging costs. 
The deadline for registration and abstract submission is 
June 13th 2014, 11:59 PM PDT.

NASA POSTDOCTORAL FELLOWSHIPS

The NASA Postdoctoral Program (NPP) provides opportunities for 
scientists and engineers to conduct research largely of their own 
choosing, yet compatible with the research opportunities posted on the 
NPP Web site.

Selected by a competitive peer-review process, NPP Fellows complete 
one- to three-year Fellowship appointments that advance NASA's 
missions in earth science, heliophysics, planetary science, 
astrophysics, space bioscience, aeronautics and engineering, human 
exploration and space operations, and astrobiology.

A sample research opportunities is:

https://www3.orau.gov/NPDoc/Catalog/17590

Applicants must have a Ph.D. or equivalent degree in hand before 
beginning the fellowship, but may apply while completing the degree 
requirements. U. S. citizens, Lawful Permanent Residents, and foreign 
nationals eligible for J-1 status as a Research Scholar may apply. 

Stipends start at $53,500 per year, with supplements for high cost-
of-living areas and for certain academic specialties. Financial 
assistance is available for relocation and health insurance, and 
$8,000 per year is provided for professional travel.

Applications are accepted three times each year: March 1, July 1, 
and November 1.

STUDENT OPPORTUNITY: LLOYD V. BERKNER SPACE POLICY INTERNSHIPS

The goal of the Lloyd V. Berkner Space Policy Internship is to provide 
promising undergraduate and graduate students with the opportunity 
to work in the area of civil space research policy in the nation's 
capital, under the aegis of the Space Studies Board (SSB).
  
The SSB oversees advisory studies (principally, the decadal surveys) 
and program assessments, facilitates international research 
coordination, and promotes communications on space science and science 
policy between the research community, the federal government, and 
the interested public. The SSB also serves as the U.S. National 
Committee for the International Council for Science (ICSU) Committee 
on Space Research (COSPAR).
 
The Lloyd V. Berkner Space Policy Internships are offered twice 
annually. The summer program is restricted to undergraduates (defined 
as an individual who does not already possess a university degree 
on the application deadline), and the autumn program is open to 
both undergraduate and graduate students. We are currently accepting 
applications for our autumn 2014 program.
 
The deadline for applications to the autumn program is June 20, 2014. 
Successful candidates will be contacted by July 17, 2014.
 
Additional information about the program, including the application 
procedure, can be found at:
