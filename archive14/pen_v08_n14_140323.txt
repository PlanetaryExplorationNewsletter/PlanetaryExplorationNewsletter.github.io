[NASA] ROSES-14 CHANGE IN DUE DATES FOR PLANETARY PROTECTION RESEARCH 
(PPR) 
 
Amendment 8 changes the due date for C.15, PPR. This program is one 
of the few calls in Planetary Science that does not use the two-step 
proposal submission process. Notices of Intent (NOIs) are requested 
by June 27, 2014, and proposals are due September 5, 2014.
 
On or about March 19, 2014, this Amendment to the NASA Research 
Announcement "Research Opportunities in Space and Earth Sciences 
(ROSES) 2014" (NNH14ZDA001N) will be posted on the NASA research 
opportunity homepage at: 

http://nspires.nasaprs.com/ 

and will appear on the RSS feed at:

NASA POSTDOCTORAL FELLOWSHIPS
 
The NASA Postdoctoral Program (NPP) provides opportunities for 
scientists and engineers to conduct research largely of their own 
choosing, yet compatible with the research opportunities posted on the 
NPP Web site.
 
Selected by a competitive peer-review process, NPP Fellows complete 
one- to three-year Fellowship appointments that advance NASA’s missions 
in earth science, heliophysics, planetary science, astrophysics, space 
bioscience, aeronautics and engineering, human exploration and space 
operations, and astrobiology.
 
An example of one of the research opportunities in planetary science 
is:
 
https://www3.orau.gov/NPDoc/Catalog/18212
 
Applicants must have a Ph.D. or equivalent degree in hand before 
beginning the fellowship, but may apply while completing the degree 
requirements. U. S. citizens, Lawful Permanent Residents, and foreign 
nationals eligible for J-1 status as a Research Scholar may apply.
 
Stipends start at $53,500 per year, with supplements for high cost-
of-living areas and for certain academic specialties. Financial 
assistance is available for relocation and health insurance, and 
$8,000 per year is provided for professional travel.

Applications are accepted three times each year: March 1, July 1, 
and November 1.

FIRST ANNOUNCEMENT: NASA TECHNOLOGY WORKSHOP FOR THE DISCOVERY 2014 AO

In the upcoming Discovery 2014 Announcement of Opportunity, NASA is 
considering offering as Government-Furnished Equipment a number of 
NASA-developed technologies. In preparation for this, NASA's Science 
Mission Directorate and Space Technology Mission Directorate are co-
hosting a "Technology Workshop."  The goal of this event is to educate 
the potential proposing community on each technology being offered and 
inform how each technology will be supported to the proposal team.
 
All expenses and arrangements for attending this meeting are the 
responsibility of the attendees. Travel costs are not allowable as 
direct costs under another Federal Government award. Government 
employees may attend and be authorized travel and associated costs as 
a matter of official business.
 
Details of the workshop are being finalized for the week of April 7, 
with a target date of Wednesday, April 9, 8:30 AM to 6:30 PM.  
Information will be available at: 

http://discovery.larc.nasa.gov/

The workshop will be divided into two sections: briefings on each 
technology offering in the morning and the opportunity for small-group 
meetings in the afternoon. In order to reach the widest audience 
possible, each briefing will also be webcast.

EDUCATION OPPORTUNITIES IN NASA STEM (EONS)

NASA's Office of Education is accepting new proposals under the 
Education Opportunities in NASA STEM (EONS) 2014 NASA Research 
Announcement for Educator Professional Development (EPD) appendix.
 
EPD is designed to provide high quality STEM professional development 
opportunities for formal and informal educators capitalizing on NASA's 
unique assets and capabilities. Pre-service, in-service, and informal 
educators working with grades K-20 and higher education faculty are 
considered customers and clients who derive benefits from EPD 
opportunities. EPD was established to consolidate historically diverse 
components into a focused effort to ensure operational efficiency 
while optimizing strategies, methods, and technologies that promote 
and foster educators' use of NASA-related content in their 
instructional activities. Proposals are due June 18, 2014.
 
For more information regarding these opportunities, please visit the 
NASA EONS page on the NSPIRES website.

BROAD AGENCY ANNOUNCEMENT (BAA) – ASTEROID REDIRECT MISSION

NASA released the Asteroid Redirect Mission Broad Agency Announcement, 
accessible at: 

https://prod.nais.nasa.gov/cgibin/eps/sol.cgi?acqid=159813#Other 01
 
During the March 26 Asteroid Initiative Opportunities Forum NASA will 
discuss the objectives of the BAA and gain feedback on it and other 
opportunities for involvement with the asteroid initiative.
 
The maximum seating capacity for the forum has been reached, and there 
is a waiting list for onsite attendance. If you are currently 
registered to attend and your availability has changed, please notify 
NASA your seat may be offered to an individual on the waiting list.
 
For virtual attendees, please tune in to the live broadcast on NASA 
TV, and join the conversation via Twitter with the hashtag #AskNASA.

CALL FOR ABSTRACTS: "COMMERCIAL EXPLORATION OF ASTEROIDS & COMETS: A 
PARADIGM SHIFT IN SMALL BODY SCIENCE" 

Session SB11/MTI9 at EPSC 2014
Abstracts are due 06 May 2014.

This session will focus on the changing emphasis of scientific
investigation of small bodies, which will develop with the movement
towards mining in space and the consequent increase in flight
opportunities and opportunities for piggyback rides for instruments 
that might otherwise be regarded as too experimental. Mining planning
introduces a requirement for information on structure and strength at
large and small scales. The other driver in the new paradigm for
asteroidal and comet studies, which overlaps with this, is the
increasing interest in body models and structure for Planetary 
Defense. Contributions are sought from the asteroid mining actors and 
the planetary science community.

Commercial exploration missions could significantly influence how
research on asteroids and comets is conducted. New opportunities for
collaborations will eventually arise. Becoming the first dedicated 
event about this topic in a European scientific forum, the session's
intention is to start a discussion and encourage substantial 
activities in the field in Europe.
