IN MEMORIAM - CHARLES A. BARTH (1930-2014)

Charles A. Barth, Professor Emeritus at the University of Colorado, 
died on October 14th 2014. Charles grew up in Philadelphia where he 
attended Central High School. He received his B.S. in chemistry at 
Lehigh University. After serving in the Air Force, he earned his Ph.D. 
from UCLA. From 1958 to 1959 he was a postdoctoral fellow at the 
University of Bonn, Germany, followed by six years working at the 
CalTech/NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory. From 1965 to 1992 he was the 
Director of the University of Colorado's Laboratory for Atmospheric 
and Space Physics (LASP) and until 2002 a professor in the Department 
of Astrophysical and Planetary Sciences. He became Professor Emeritus 
in 2002.

Between 1962 and 2002, Charles was active on numerous experiments 
studying the Earth and other planets, including Mariners 5, 6, 7, and 
9, OGO-2, 4, 5, and 6, Atmosphere Explorer-C and D, the Solar 
Mesosphere Explorer, the Student Nitric Oxide Experiment, and 
instruments on Apollo 17, Pioneer Venus, Galileo, and Cassini. 
He mentored and inspired many undergraduate and graduate students, 
postdoctoral fellows, and scientists, producing a lasting legacy of 
friends, colleagues, and outstanding scientists. He will be missed 
greatly.

CALL FOR ABSTRACTS: "NANO-SATELLITES DEPLOYED FROM CARRIER SPACECRAFT -
A PARADIGM SHIFT IN PLANETARY SCIENCES?"

Session PS1.3/GI2.13 at EGU 2015
Abstracts are due 07 January 2015

Across the planetary science community, there is an increasing interest
in carrying secondary spacecraft on-board larger missions to planets,
moons, asteroids and comets. This tendency is significantly inspired by
the relative ease and sinking price of building nano-satellites. Both
space agencies and companies have been proposing design concepts for
such carriers. The idea of deploying a number of small spacecraft 
around a celestial body provides new and unseen scientific 
opportunities for advanced studies. Those may for instance take 
advantage of operating in an interconnected cloud or constellation. 
Individual inexpensive nano-satellites deployed from a carrier can also 
take greater exploration risks than would be possible for an expensive 
integrated spacecraft. This session invites contributions discussing 
the scientific potential of hosted nano-satellites, new instruments 
suited to the limited volume and power on nano-satellites, mission 
concepts and associated challenges as well as possible solutions.

ABSTRACT DEADLINE APPROACHING: NOVEMBER 18 FOR "WORKSHOP ON EARLY 
SOLAR SYSTEM BOMBARDMENT III"

The goal is to investigate the range of collisional events from the 
late stages of terrestrial planet accretion to the end of the basin-
forming epoch on the Moon. Although the Moon will be a central 
component of the workshop, the discussion will include observations 
elsewhere, such as Mercury, Mars, the asteroid belt, and outer solar 
system moons. 

Example topics relevant to bombardment include an assessment of the 
geologic record of impact cratering throughout the solar system, 
cosmochemical constraints on any early bombardment, and dynamical 
models that might explain the flux of debris and potential changes 
in the flux of debris. Example topics relevant to giant impact 
concepts include cosmochemical and geophysical constraints on lunar 
formation; giant impact simulations; the chemical, thermal, and/or 
dynamical evolution of the protolunar disk; and the accretion and 
early evolution of the Moon.

SOLAR SYSTEM OBSERVATIONS WITH THE K2 MISSION 

The K2 mission will make use of the Kepler spacecraft and its assets 
to expand upon Kepler's groundbreaking discoveries through new and 
exciting observations.

K2 will use an innovative way of operating the spacecraft to observe 
target fields along the ecliptic for the next 2-3 years. Early science 
commissioning observations have shown an estimated photometric 
precision near 150 ppm in a single 30 minute observation, and a 6-hr 
photometric precision of 40 ppm (both at V = 12). The K2 mission 
offers long-term, simultaneous optical observations of thousands of 
objects at a precision far better than is achievable from ground-based 
telescopes. K2 will provide limited opportunities for solar system 
observations. Generally, slow moving sources and major planets between 
V=4 and 20 will be possible targets. K2 has a funded GO program 
accepting proposals twice a year.

Workshop at the 46th Annual DPS meeting in Tucson:
TUESDAY, NOVEMBER 11, 2014 at 10:00AM-noon 
Arizona Ballroom 1-4 

This workshop will consist of: 
1) Presentations on the K2 mission as well as Solar System 
   observations with the mission, and 
2) Discussion with the broader community to identify observatory 
   capabilities and envision future opportunities.

WOMEN COUNT

A gender imbalance exists in science and is harmful to our community 
as a whole. Awareness is one of the best techniques to combat bias. 
Therefore, if you are not actively thinking about diversity, you can 
be contributing unwittingly to the problem. This article calls for 
making a consious effort to consider diversity when assembling 
personnel for non-competed positions: Women Count, appearing in Eos, 
by Dana Hurley (JHU/APL).

PDS VOLUNTEER REVIEWERS

The Planetary Science Division is seeking volunteer reviewers to serve 
on the science panel to assess instrument proposals submitted in 
response to the Europa Instrument Investigation AO released in July 
2015. As you are all aware, the NASA review and selection process 
can't function without experienced members of the community who step 
forward and offer their services to evaluate the proposals that are 
under consideration. While reviewers for a potential flight opportunity 
such as this are typically responsible for evaluating fewer proposals 
than in a standard R&A review, the proposals themselves are longer and 
more complex, and the workload per proposal is consequently greater 
than in an R&A review. Therefore, compensation for service on the 
Europa instrument science panel will be greater than for a standard 
R&A review panel. These instruments will provide the mission data you 
will be analyzing for the remainder of your career, and this is your 
opportunity to contribute to making sure that the best data is 
collected by the best instruments. Please don't hesitate to step 
forward and help secure the best mission possible for NASA and the 
science community.

Please contact Dr. Curt Niebur (curt.niebur@nasa.gov), the Europa 
Program Scientist at NASA HQ, if you are interested in serving.
