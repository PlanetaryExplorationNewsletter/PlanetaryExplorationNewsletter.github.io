MEETING REMINDER AND ABSTRACT SUBMISSION FOR IPM-2014

Preparations are well under way for the 2nd International Workshop 
on 'Instrumentation for Planetary Missions' (IPM-2014) to be held 
November 4-7, 2014. 

The objective of the Workshop is to have a broad canvas of 
instrumentation and technology available to 'Decadal Survey' missions
and those further out. It is also meant to be a forum of collaboration, 
exchange and discussions where science questions, and the technology 
needed to address them, are discussed.

Exceptional keynote and invited speakers are a highlighted part of 
the program.

Visit the link below to submit an abstract by Aug 25, 2014 and view 
details regarding registration:

http://ssed.gsfc.nasa.gov/IPM/

We encourage you to submit an abstract and be part of this unique 
international gathering focused on instrumentation for planetary 
missions.

The first such Workshop held in 2012 was attended by 230 people 
from across the globe. Early indications suggest that this one will 
surpass that.

Mark your calendar! Be part of this unique experience!

[NASA] ROSES-14: PDART INCLUDES NEW REFERENCE INFORMATION

The objective of this program element is to increase the amount and 
quality of archived data and data products available for planetary 
science research and exploration and to produce tools that would 
enable or enhance future scientific investigations. Although it is 
expected that a small amount of data analysis or modeling may be 
performed to validate any generated products, this program element 
does not accept proposals in which the main focus is a scientific 
investigation.

This amendment makes explicit (via a new version of section 1.5) that 
this program includes the generation of new reference information. 
Since the scope of this program has been expanded slightly the 
schedule for proposal due date has been reset: 
Step-1 proposals are now due July 17, 2014
Step-2 proposals are now due September 17, 2014

New text is in bold and deleted text is struck through.

NASA POSTDOCTORAL FELLOWSHIPS

The NASA Postdoctoral Program (NPP) provides opportunities for 
scientists and engineers to conduct research largely of their own 
choosing, yet compatible with the research opportunities posted on the 
NPP Web site.

Selected by a competitive peer-review process, NPP Fellows complete 
one- to three-year Fellowship appointments that advance NASA's missions 
in earth science, heliophysics, planetary science, astrophysics, space 
bioscience, aeronautics and engineering, human exploration and space 
operations, and astrobiology.

A sample research opportunity is:

https://www3.orau.gov/NPDoc/Catalog/17903   

Applicants must have a Ph.D. or equivalent degree in hand before 
beginning the fellowship, but may apply while completing the degree 
requirements. U. S. citizens, Lawful Permanent Residents, and foreign 
nationals eligible for J-1 status as a Research Scholar may apply.

Stipends start at $53,500 per year, with supplements for high cost-of-
living areas and for certain academic specialties. Financial assistance 
is available for relocation and health insurance, and $8,000 per year 
is provided for professional travel.
 
Applications are accepted three times each year: March 1, July 1,
and November 1.

PDS/SBN IS NOW ACTIVE ON TWITTER AND FACEBOOK

The Planetary Data System Small Bodies Node (PDS/SBN) has begun using 
social networks to announce important dates, upcoming release 
information, news related to our archival data and its use, new tools 
for PDS data preparers and users, and other news from the SBN. You can 
find us on Facebook at:

http://www.facebook.com/PDSSmallBodiesNode

and you can follow us on Twitter (@SBNarchive) for breaking news.

The PDS Small Bodies Node specializes in the archiving, cataloging, 
and distribution of scientific data sets relevant to asteroids, 
comets and interplanetary dust. The archived data sets are primarily 
from NASA missions, but also includes data from foreign missions as 
well as ground-based observations.
