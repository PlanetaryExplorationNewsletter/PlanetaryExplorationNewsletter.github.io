JULY 1 DEADLINE FOR PSS "SOLAR WIND INTERACTIONS WITH THE TERRESTRIAL
PLANETS

The deadline for submissions to the special issue "Solar wind 
Interaction with the Terrestrial Planets" in the Planetary and Space 
Science journal is July 1, 2014. Covered topics include all aspects of 
planetary plasma physics and interactions in the inner Solar System, 
e.g.:

(a) Magnetospheres, ionospheres, auroras
(b) The solar wind interaction with planets (Mercury, Venus, Earth,
    Mars) and their moons, or with asteroids/comets
(c) Plasma interactions with exospheres, dust and surfaces
(d) Intercomparisons of planetary environments

Contributions are welcome which address previous, present, forthcoming 
and planned observations from space, as well as ground-based 
observations, theoretical modelling or simulations. Laboratory studies 
on planetary analogues aiming to simulate the surface-plasma 
interaction are considered as well.

DENNIS SCHATZ OF PACIFIC SCIENCE CENTER WINS ASTRONOMY OUTREACH AWARD

Dennis Schatz, Senior Advisor and former Senior Vice President of 
Pacific Science Center in Seattle, has won the 2014 Klumpke-Roberts 
Award of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific, given for a lifetime 
of contributions to the public understanding of astronomy. Previous 
winners of this prestigious award include Carl Sagan, Isaac Asimov, 
Dava Sobel, and Timothy Ferris.

Schatz's more than 20 books on science for children (including The 
Astronomy Activity Book) have been translated into 23 languages and 
have sold more than 2 million copies. Schatz is perhaps best known for 
his widely-used hands-on astronomy activities, which put students in 
the role of scientists -- asking questions, doing experiments, and 
drawing conclusions. These activities include "Reasons for the 
Seasons," "Pocket Sun Clock," "Modeling and Explaining Lunar Phases," 
"Invent an Alien," and "Recipe for your own Comet." Many of his 
activities have been published in two popular astronomy curriculum 
packages, AstroAdventures and The Universe at Your Fingertips.

THEMIS GEODETICALLY CONTROLLED MOSAICS AVAILABLE FROM THE USGS

THEMIS infrared geodetically controlled mosaics, updated spacecraft 
pointing and orientation information (i.e., preliminary smithed SPICE 
kernels), and supporting documentation are available for download and 
public use from the United States Geological Survey (USGS) Astrogeology 
Science Center. Nine daytime infrared and eight nighttime infrared 
mosaics are currently available, with additional mosaics being released 
each January and July until a global product is completed. These 
mosaics are tied to a known coordinate system (USGS Viking Orbiter Mars 
Digital Image Model 2.1), spatially adjusted to align feature 
boundaries, and orthoprojected at 100 m/pixel scale. This process 
results in sub-pixel registration between images and the daytime IR and 
nighttime IR mosaics to be well-registered to one another. These 
products enhance our knowledge (e.g., position, precision, and 
accuracy) of image placement and the location of small-scale surface 
features, and will benefit the current and future orbital acquisition 
of data, the planning of spacecraft and surface operations, and allows 
for easier and improved intercomparison of all Mars data sets.

Please see the following website for product download and additional 
documentation:

POSTDOC POSITION AT UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO LASP

The Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics (LASP) at the 
University of Colorado Boulder is seeking to fill immediately a 
postdoctoral research associate position to investigate the near-Mars 
space environment within the context of the Mar-solar wind interaction. 
The research will involve: (1) modeling of the physical processes at 
work in the Martian ionosphere and induced magnetosphere with an 
emphasis on atmospheric escape, and/or (2) analysis of the data 
returned from the NASA Mars Atmosphere and Volatile EvolutioN (MAVEN) 
mission.

Applicants must have a Ph.D. degree in planetary and space physics or 
a closely related field. Previous experience with programming is 
desirable. Interested applicants must be dedicated, highly motivated, 
and have a good track record of publication. The postdoctoral position 
is initially for one year, and may be extended, contingent upon 
performance and funding availability. Applications will be considered 
beginning June 15, 2014 and the position will remain open until filled. 
For specifics about the position, contact Dr. Xiaohua Fang at 
xiaohua.fang@lasp.colorado.edu.

NASA POSTDOCTORAL FELLOWSHIPS

The NASA Postdoctoral Program (NPP) provides opportunities for 
scientists and engineers to conduct research largely of their own 
choosing, yet compatible with the research opportunities posted on the 
NPP Web site.

Selected by a competitive peer-review process, NPP Fellows complete 
one- to three-year Fellowship appointments that advance NASA's missions 
in earth science, heliophysics, planetary science, astrophysics, space 
bioscience, aeronautics and engineering, human exploration and space 
operations, and astrobiology.

An example of one of the research opportunities in planetary science 
is:

https://www3.orau.gov/NPDoc/Catalog/17710

Applicants must have a Ph.D. or equivalent degree in hand before 
beginning the fellowship, but may apply while completing the degree 
requirements. U.S. citizens, Lawful Permanent Residents, and 
foreign nationals eligible for J-1 status as a Research Scholar may 
apply.

Stipends start at $53,500 per year, with supplements for high 
cost-of-living areas and for certain academic specialties. Financial 
assistance is available for relocation and health insurance, and 
$8,000 per year is provided for professional travel.

Applications are accepted three times each year: March 1, July 1, and 
November 1.

NASA INVITES UNIVERSITIES TO SUBMIT INNOVATIVE EARLY-STAGE TECHNOLOGY 
PROPOSALS

NASA is seeking proposals from universities to advance the agency's 
plans for exploration to deep space and Mars. The Early Stage 
Innovations NASA Research Announcement calls for innovative space 
technology proposals that could benefit the space program, other 
government agencies and the greater aerospace community.

NASA's Space Technology Mission Directorate expects to make 
approximately 12 awards this fall, with total award amounts of up to 
$500,000. Research and development efforts will take place over two to 
three years.

Researchers will investigate transformative space technologies in 
areas such as advanced thermal protection materials modeling, 
computational materials, in situ utilization of asteroid materials, 
mobile robotic surface probe concepts for planetary exploration, 
kinetic penetrators for icy planetary moons, and advanced technology 
habitat system designs for continued human exploration of space.

Only accredited U.S. universities may submit proposals under this 
solicitation. Notices of intent to submit proposals to the Early 
Stage Innovations Appendix of NASA's Research Announcement, Space 
Technology Research, Development, Demonstration, and Infusion 2014 
(SpaceTech-REDDI-2014), are due June 24. The deadline for submitting 
final proposals is July 21.

NEW APPROACHES TO LUNAR ICE DETECTION AND MAPPING

We are pleased to announce the release of the final report for the 
study, "New Approaches to Lunar Ice Detection and Mapping", from the 
Keck Institute for Space Studies:

http://kiss.caltech.edu/study/lunar-ice/KISS_lunar_report.pdf 

(36 Mb PDF)

This study, which began in July 2013, was motivated by recent advances 
in two areas: 1) remote sensing data and models provide compelling 
(though sometimes conflicting) evidence for the presence of 
concentrated volatiles on the Moon, and 2) small, low-cost spacecraft 
have emerged as a potentially viable means of planetary exploration 
and science. We therefore sought to identify key measurements for 
lunar ice detection and mapping that could be accomplished through 
innovative, low-cost mission concepts.

The report summarizes the current state of knowledge about lunar 
volatiles, and identifies future measurement approaches that could 
clarify their abundance, composition, and distribution. The mission 
concepts presented are a small subset of those considered in the study, 
and are those we found most compelling and/or technically mature. More 
information on this study can be found here:
