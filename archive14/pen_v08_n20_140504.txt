IN MEMORIAM: BARNEY CONRATH (1935-2014)

Our colleague Barney Conrath passed away peacefully in his sleep on 
April 23 after a bout with cancer. Barney was an astrophysicist, 
working at NASA/Goddard Space Flight Center and Cornell University. 
His studies of planetary atmospheres included experiments on the 
Voyager 1 and 2 missions, Mars Global Surveyor, and most recently on 
the NASA/European Space Agency Cassini mission. He has won several 
awards, including the Kuiper Prize, 1996, from the Division of 
Planetary Sciences of the American Astronomical Society.

Barney's obituary is available at:

BUDGET ADVOCACY LETTER TO PROFESSIONAL PLANETARY SCIENCE COLLEAGUES 

As President of the Board of Directors of The Planetary Society (TPS), 
a fellow member of professional societies engaged in planetary research 
(AAS/DPS, AGU, and GSA), and a colleague deeply concerned about funding 
for planetary science research and missions, I wanted to send a note to 
highlight important recent developments. TPS, along with leaders of 
the relevant sections of the DPS, AGU, and GSA, and many of you, have 
been working hard over the past few years to jointly advocate for NASA 
budget levels that will enable our community to meet the objectives of 
the Planetary Science Decadal Survey. Together, we have all had some 
influence in the process, as evidenced by Congressional increases in 
recent actual enacted Planetary Science Division budgets over the 
levels proposed by the Administration, and actions like the intention 
to release the AO for the 13th Discovery mission this fiscal year.  
However, we are not yet where we need to be to achieve the Decadal 
goals, and so your continued action and support is needed as the FY15 
budget is being formulated *right now*.

JWST NOW IN HORIZONS

The James Webb Space Telescope’s planning trajectory has been added to 
JPL's Horizons ephemeris system. It is now possible to generate 
ephemerides of all cataloged solar system bodies with respect to JWST 
by setting the observing site/center to @jwst. This trajectory will 
be updated to the actual orbit after launch. As a reminder, the JWST 
Solar System Working Group has been considering science cases from the 
solar system observing community for future observations with NASA's 
next great observatory. A white paper summarizing the instrumentation 
and observatory capabilities, as well as key science cases is now 
available at:

http://arxiv.org/abs/1403.6845

EUROPEAN PLANETARY SCIENCES CONFERENCE 2014

The European Planetary Sciences Conference 2014 will be held in 
Estoril, Portugal, on 7-12 September this year. The abstract deadline 
is 6 May. Conference website is:  

http://epsc2014.eu

We would like to draw your attention in particular to the Venus session 
(TP3). Rather than have a combined "Terrestrial Planet atmospheres 
session", this year we are having a dedicated Venus session to enable 
a broad view of surface, atmosphere and evolution of this planet in 
support of a forthcoming "Venus 3" book project. We invite abstracts 
on all aspects of Venus science, from modelling to observation, from 
interior to surface to atmosphere to exosphere.
 
Best regards,
Colin Wilson

NASA SBAG-OPAG JOINT STATEMENT ON THE SCIENTIFIC PRIORITY OF 
IDENTIFYING A KBO FOR THE NEW HORIZONS MISSION

The full statement can be found at:

http://www.lpi.usra.edu/sbag/documents/NewHorizons0430.pdf

Despite an extensive and continuing ground-based search making use of 
the world's best deep, wide-field imaging facilities, and discovering 
over 50 new KBOs, a target has not yet been found that can be reached 
with the fuel available to New Horizons after the Pluto encounter in 
July 2015. The ground-based search effort will continue in 2014. But 
even under optimistic assumptions for weather and seeing, a ground-
based search has less than 50% chance of finding at least one viable 
target during the 2014 apparition, based on current best estimates. In 
contrast, a dedicated search (<200 orbits during the 2014 apparition) 
using the Hubble Space Telescope is very likely to find one or more 
reachable KBOs. The probability of a successful search substantially 
declines if postponed to 2015. Therefore, joint statement of the NASA 
Small Bodies Assessment Group and Outer Planets Assessment Group 
strongly supports the New Horizons KBO search team's proposal to bring 
the unique capabilities of HST to bear on this problem as soon as 
possible.

ICARUS SPECIAL ISSUE ON LUNAR VOLATILES: DEADLINE EXTENDED TO JUNE 1,
2014

In the past five years, the paradigm of lunar volatiles research has
shifted from hypothesizing on the existence of volatiles on the Moon 
to classifying the abundance and distribution of different types of 
volatiles on the Moon. This special issue reports work advancing the 
understanding of volatiles in, on, and around the Moon including the 
primordial inventory, volatile additions and losses throughout the 
history of the Moon, and the current inventory of volatiles.  

Manuscripts publishing spacecraft data relevant to mapping and 
quantifying lunar volatiles are sought. In addition, papers focused on 
the processes related to the storage, maintenance, migration, delivery, 
or removal of volatiles are appropriate. The special issue solicits 
submissions containing new scientific research via laboratory studies, 
remote sensing, data analysis, modeling, sample analysis, or 
theoretical investigations.

The submitted papers must be written in English and describe original
research that is not published nor currently under review by other
journals or conferences. Author guidelines for preparation of 
manuscript can be found at:
