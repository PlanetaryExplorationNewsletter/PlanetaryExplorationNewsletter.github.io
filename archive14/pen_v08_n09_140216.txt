PROPOSAL WRITING WORKSHOP AT LPSC

Curious about how to improve the quality of the proposals you send 
to NASA? Ever wonder what the review panel is really looking for 
when it reviews that proposal? The Planetary Science Division at 
NASA Headquarters is offering a Proposal Writing Workshop at LPSC 
that is based on the cumulative experience of current and former 
Discipline Scientists who have managed a variety of Research and 
Announcement (R&A) programs at NASA Headquarters. The specific focus 
of this intense, educational session is to provide a greater 
understanding of NASA's research programs and review process and 
offer constructive and practical insight into writing an effective 
research proposal. The event is open to all at no charge and will 
be held on Sunday, March 16, from 12-4 pm in Waterway 1. All 
interested planetary scientists, from graduate students through 
emeritus professors, are encouraged to attend.
 
To register, send an e-mail with your name, affiliation, and 
current position to curt.niebur@nasa.gov.

MARS EXPLORATION PROGRAM OPPORTUNITY 1

The Mars Exploration Program (MEP) would like to solicit your 
participation on a Mars 2020 Contamination Study Panel.

The panel will have approximately 5-10 members, plus involvement of 
program/project/discipline support personnel. It is anticipated that 
the panel members would have expertise and knowledge spanning 
astrobiology, organic chemistry/geochemistry including theory and 
state-of-the-art lab practices, and contamination control and 
measurement. The panel will meet by teleconference once or twice 
per week between March 1 and July 1, with two face-to-face meetings. 
A draft report will be due May 1, and final report July 1.

If you are able and interested in supporting this effort, please, 
send a curriculum vitae and letter of interest to Dr. Michael Meyer 
via email (mars2020-contam-study@lists.nasa.gov), by 
February 25, 2014. Thank you for your consideration.

Regards,
Michael Meyer, Lead Scientist, NASA Mars Exploration Program

MARS EXPLORATION PROGRAM OPPORTUNITY 2

Announcing a pre-LPSC planning meeting: Planning for Potential Mars 
Returned Sample Science: Considerations Related to Sample Quality

Sunday March 16, 2014, 8:30 am - 4 pm

Who should attend: Scientists with experience in any aspect of 
Mars-relevant sample studies

Desired outcome: Descriptions of the factors related to minimum 
acceptable quality for the samples that would potentially be the 
basis of Mars returned sample science, and formulations of potential 
baseline and threshold sample quality requirements for each factor.

Why: The science community needs to describe the desired and minimum 
acceptable state of the samples that would be needed to achieve the 
scientific objectives of MSR. This is a key input into: 
a) requirements formulation for the M-2020 rover, and 
b) forward planning for the other potential flight and ground 
elements that would be associated with MSR.

Where: The Woodlands Conference Center, Panther Creek Room

Space is limited. Please RSVP to Carla De La Paz at paz@jpl.nasa.gov.

NASA POSTDOCTORAL FELLOWSHIPS

The NASA Postdoctoral Program (NPP) provides opportunities for 
scientists and engineers to conduct research largely of their own 
choosing, yet compatible with the research opportunities posted on 
the NPP Web site.

Selected by a competitive peer-review process, NPP Fellows complete 
one- to three-year Fellowship appointments that advance NASA's 
missions in earth science, heliophysics, planetary science, 
astrophysics, space bioscience, aeronautics and engineering, human 
exploration and space operations, and astrobiology.

An sample research opportunity is:

https://www3.orau.gov/NPDoc/Catalog/17614

Applicants must have a Ph.D. or equivalent degree in hand before 
beginning the fellowship, but may apply while completing the degree 
requirements. U. S. citizens, Lawful Permanent Residents, and foreign 
nationals eligible for J-1 status as a Research Scholar may apply.

Stipends start at $53,500 per year, with supplements for high cost-
of-living areas and for certain academic specialties. Financial 
assistance is available for relocation and health insurance, and 
$8,000 per year is provided for professional travel.

Applications are accepted three times each year: March 1, July 1, 
and November 1.

MARS CRITICAL DATA PRODUCTS PROGRAM (ROUND IX) - INITIAL LANDING SITE 
CHARACTERIZATION FOR THE MARS 2020 ROVER MISSION

The Mars Exploration Program has issued, in January 2014, a Request 
for Proposal (RFP) for round IX of the Mars Critical Data Products 
program. This RFP provides support for initial landing site surface, 
atmosphere, and gravity characterization for the Mars 2020 rover 
mission. The intent is to convert mission data and numerical 
simulations into products focused on specific landing site targets 
(to be provided by the program) that will be useful for reducing the 
risk to the Mars 2020 rover mission. Proposals are due on Wednesday, 
March 5, 2014.

Details of the RFPs are posted at:

4TH "PAOLO FARINELLA" PRIZE, 2014

To honor the memory and the outstanding figure of Paolo Farinella 
(1953-2000), a prize has been established in recognition of significant 
contributions given in the fields of interest of Paolo, which span 
from planetary sciences to space geodesy, fundamental physics, science 
popularization, security in space, weapons control and disarmament.

The prize has been proposed during the "International Workshop on 
Paolo Farinella the Scientist and the Man", held in Pisa in 2010, 
and is supported by the University of Pisa and by IAPS-INAF (Rome).

The fourth Prize is devoted to planetary sciences and specifically 
to studies on the "non gravitational forces in the Solar System," 
both in their application to small natural Solar System bodies and to 
artificial objects, which were among the major research interests 
in Paolo's career. The award ceremony will be hosted by the European 
Planetary Science Congress (EPSC) meeting in Cascais, Portugal (7th 
to 12th of September 2014).

Candidates should have international and interdisciplinary 
collaborations and should be not older than 47 years at the date 
of April 30, 2014.

Nominations must be sent by email not later than April 30, 2014, at 
the following addresses: a.rossi@ifac.cnr.it, giovanni@iaps.inaf.it
