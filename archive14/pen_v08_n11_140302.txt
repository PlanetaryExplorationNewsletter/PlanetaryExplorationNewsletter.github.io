THOMAS PIERSON, 1950-2014

Tom Pierson, who founded the SETI Institute and went on to become its 
Chief Executive Officer for most of the organization's first thirty 
years, died on February 20 of cancer. He had been on medical leave 
since 2012.

Under Pierson's guidance, the Institute grew from a tiny, narrowly 
focused research center with a handful of employees to its current 
status: an internationally known organization that is home to more 
than 130 scientists, educators, and support staff. While founded to 
conduct SETI searches, the Institute soon broadened its mandate to 
encompass all aspects of understanding the nature and prevalence of 
life beyond Earth.

[NASA] ROSES-14: PLANETARY SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY THROUGH ANALOG 
RESEARCH

Future planetary research associated with solar system exploration 
requires the development of relevant, miniaturized instrumentation 
capable of extensive operations on lunar, asteroid, and planetary 
surfaces throughout the Solar System. To this end, this Planetary 
Science and Technology Through Analog Research (PSTAR) program solicits 
proposals for investigations focused on exploring the relevant 
environments on Earth in order to develop a sound technical and 
scientific basis to conduct planetary research on other solar system 
bodies. The PSTAR program is a science-driven exploration program that 
is expected to result in new science and operational/technological 
capabilities to enable the next generation of planetary exploration.
 
Proposals to this program will be taken by a two-step process, in which 
the Notice of Intent is replaced by a required Step-1 proposal 
submitted by an organization Authorized Organizational Representative. 
Only proposers who submit a Step-1 proposal are eligible to submit a 
Step-2 (full) proposal. See Section 2.8 for details. Step-1 proposals 
are due July 25, 2014, and Step-2 proposals are due September 26, 2014.

[NASA] ROSES-14: DISCOVERY DATA ANALYSIS PROGRAM

The objective of the Discovery Data Analysis Program (DDAP) is to 
enhance the scientific return of Discovery Program missions by 
broadening the scientific participation in the analysis of data, both 
recent and archived, collected by Discovery missions.
 
This amendment changes the name of C.11 to the Discovery Data Analysis 
Program and presents the final text, which replaces the placeholder 
text in its entirety. Proposals to this program will be taken by a two-
step process, in which the Notice of Intent is replaced by a required 
Step-1 proposal submitted by an Authorized Organizational 
Representative. Only proposers who submit a Step-1 proposal are 
eligible to submit a Step-2 (full) proposal. See Section 2 for details. 
Step-1 proposals are due July 21, 2014, and Step-2 proposals are due 
September 19, 2014.

[NASA] ROSES-14: ORIGINS OF SOLAR SYSTEMS NOW EXOPLANETS RESEARCH

The Origins of Solar Systems (OSS) program element does not appear in 
Research Opportunities in Space and Earth Science (ROSES) - 2014. 
Appendix E.3 is now the Exoplanets Research Program.
 
Proposals with scientific objectives that previously were included in 
the OSS program element may now be submitted to Exoplanets Research 
(E.3), Emerging Worlds (C.2), and Habitable Worlds (C.4). For more 
information see Section 2.2 of Exoplanets Research (E.3). For details 
on the limitations and requirements for these new program elements, 
please refer to the text of these calls and the Planetary Science 
Research Program Overview (Appendix C.1).
 
Proposals to all of these programs must be submitted by a two-step 
process, in which the Notice of Intent is now a required Step-1 
proposal submitted by an organization Authorized Organizational 
Representative. Only proposers who submit a Step-1 proposal are 
eligible to submit a Step-2 (full) proposal. Step-1 due dates can be 
found in Tables 2 and 3 of ROSES 2014 that may be found at:

[NASA] ROSES-14: NON-DISCOVERY DATA ANALYSIS PROPOSALS

With the announcement of Amendment 3, that released final text for C.11 
and changed the name to the Discovery Data Analysis Program, questions 
have arisen as to where to submit proposals that do not fit within the 
constraints of the Data Analysis Programs (such as non-Discovery 
Mission data). 
 
PSD solicits proposals for work that is primarily analysis of planetary 
mission data through the Data Analysis Programs. If a proposal is not 
appropriate for one of the Data Analysis programs but does fit within 
the bounds of a Core Research Program (i.e. Solar System Workings or 
Emerging Worlds), it should be submitted to that Core Program. If a 
proposal would analyze data within the scope of more than one of the 
data analysis programs, in order to perform comparative studies across 
the Solar System, but is not appropriate to any one data analysis 
program, then submission to a Core Research Program is encouraged.

[NASA] ROSES-14: NUMEROUS CHANGES

A number of clarifications and corrections were made to calls in 
Appendix C of ROSES 2014. These include: All references to name of C.11 
have been changed from the "Planetary Mission Data Analysis" program to 
the "Discovery Data Analysis" program, consistent with the name change 
from Amendment 3. Information on the two-step proposal submission 
process was updated in all calls. A new sub section on data archiving 
and map publications has been added to the many calls. Finally, in many 
(but not all) calls the start date for projects given in the summary 
table of key information has been set to "~6 months after Step-2 
proposal due date." If a call has been updated there will be a number 
of indications that this is the case: First, the text of the call will 
have a dated bold notice at the top summarizing what changes have been 
made. Second, the PDF version of the file will have "as clarified" at 
the end of the name. Third, on the web page for each of the program 
elements under "Notices" it will note that a change was made to that 
call. Calls that are currently still TBD (e.g., C.4, C.7, C.8, C.19, 
& C.20) have not yet been changed. As TBD calls are replaced with final 
text SMD will issue Amendments to ROSES 2014.

ISC SESSION 38: EXTRATERRESTRIAL SEDIMENTOLOGY

19th International Sedimentological Conference, Geneva, Switzerland, 
August 2014

http://www.sedimentologists.org/meetings/isc

Gian Gabriele Ori, Clara Mangili

Data and images from recent planetary missions show that sedimentary 
processes shaped the surface of many planetary bodies. The rovers on 
the surface of Mars observed sedimentary structures; orbiters around
Mars show palaeolakes, rivers and deltas. Chemical conditions could 
have sustained the origin of life on the planet. While Marsâ€™ rivers 
and lakes belong to the past, on Titan, its hydrocarbon lakes, rivers 
and seas, sedimentary processes are presently at work. 

Sedimentology appears to be a key in interpreting the geological 
history of planetary bodies. Even on the Moon, many surficial processes 
can be discussed in sedimentological terms. The interpretation of 
these sedimentary deposits gives us indications for reconstructing 
past climate conditions on Mars and Titan and a better key to 
understand also Earthâ€™s past and future.

This session invites contribution on extraterrestrial sedimentology,
in particular, based on Mars and Titan observations. Earth analogues, 
a key in understanding the planetary processes, are also addressed. 
The session accepts all contributions dealing with different 
depositional environments, sedimentary sequences, facies models, as 
well as technological and operational aspects of the planetary 
exploration.

WORKSHOP ON THE STUDY OF THE ICE GIANT PLANETS

July 28â€“30, 2014
Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Lab, Laurel, Maryland

The goal of this 2.5-day workshop is to raise awareness of the 
uniqueness/importance of ice giants in our solar system and others and 
lay out key science goals and a potential suite of investigations for 
New Frontiers-Flagship mission concepts. We will review the current 
state of knowledge of all aspects of the ice giant planetary systems 
(planets, satellites, rings, etc.), and how it relates to our knowledge 
of the gas giants, planetary formation models, and the study of 
exoplanets, incorporating outcomes of the 2013 Paris Uranus meeting. 
We will initiate a major effort to prioritize the science goals of 
future Uranus and Neptune missions and review studied architectures 
for these mission concepts. Contributed talks/posters are welcome, 
particularly those that focus on the state of knowledge and mission 
studies. Abstract submission will open in early May 2014.

MARS EXPLORATION PROGRAM ANALYSIS GROUP (MEPAG) FACE-TO-FACE MEETING

1.5 days, May 13-14, 2014, Crystal City Marriott in the Washington, DC 
area 
 
There have been many developments in Mars exploration over the past 
year:  Discoveries by Curiosity and other operating Mars missions, the 
release of the AO and the receipt of instrument proposals for the 2020 
Mars Rover, the launches of NASAâ€™s MAVEN and ISROâ€™s MOM missions to 
Mars, the implications for Mars and Planetary Science of the passage 
of the FY14 budget and release of the Presidentâ€™s proposed FY15 budget, 
and the developing vision of human exploration at Mars.
 
This meeting will report on the implications of these events as well 
as the overall status of Mars exploration. Further, there will be a 
report from the ongoing MEPAG Special Regions Science Analysis Group.
 
This meeting will be followed by the First Landing Site Workshop for 
the 2020 Mars Rover mission.
 
The meeting is open to all members of the Mars science community and 
our international colleagues. We will also broadcast the meeting via 
Adobe Connect for those who cannot attend in person.

ARCHIVED PRESENTATIONS AVAILABLE: WORKSHOP ON THE HABITABILITY OF ICY 
WORLDS

Held on February 5â€“7, 2014, Pasadena, California
 
The Workshop on the Habitability of Icy Worlds was a great success with 
~140 attendees and over 40 people on line. The primary objective of 
this workshop was to focus on the astrobiological potential of icy 
worlds in the outer solar systemâ€“including Europa, Ganymede, Enceladus, 
Titan and beyondâ€“with discussion on future research directions and 
spacecraft missions that can best assess that potential. Overview 
presentations were given on the first morning, while the remainder of 
the workshop was focused on thematic sessions: water and exotic 
solvents; chemical energy for life; organics and their detection; ocean 
physics and chemistry; icy world activity and habitability over time; 
and continuing and future outer solar system exploration.

LPSC TOWN HALL: OBSERVATIONS IN THE SOLAR SYSTEM WITH HST AND JWST

Thursday, March 20, 12:00 p.m. to 1:15 p.m., Waterway 1
Remote participation and other details can be found here:

http://www.stsci.edu/jwst/science/solar-system

This Town Hall meeting is proposed to give the community an 
opportunity to provide input to the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) solar 
system committee and a chance to hear the current status of the 
committee's activities. Additionally, we will present the 
accomplishments and status of the recommendations provided to the James 
Webb Space Telescope (JWST) team last year regarding solar system 
observations and solicits the community for further input. It is 
envisaged that there would be a half hour of brief presentations from 
both projects followed by a science talk by Britney Schmidt (Georgia 
Tech) and discussion. Our goal is to fully engage the solar system 
community to provide them with the tools they need to propose for time 
on HST and begin planning their observations with JWST. A key output of 
the workshop will be capability objectives for the JWST team to 
consider for further pre-launch operational studies, so that a broad 
suite of solar system observations will be enabled.
