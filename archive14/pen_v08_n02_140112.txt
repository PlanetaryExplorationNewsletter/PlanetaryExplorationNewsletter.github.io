EDITORIAL: FIRST, DO NO HARM

Mark V. Sykes
Planetary Science Institute

Every community assessment group has found that implementation of NASA 
planetary research restructuring should be delayed and formally 
reviewed. At last week's NASA Small Bodies Assessment Group (SBAG), 
NASA announced that circulation to the Planetary Science Subcommittee 
of a draft ROSES2014 announcement containing this restructuring will 
constitute a "Senior Review." Rollout will be in mid-February.

The most immediate threat is the ROSES2014 proposal due date of late 
February 2015 for the monster "Solar System Workings" (SSW) to which 
1/3 of all planetary research and data analysis proposals will be 
submitted. For proposers to the major programs Cosmochemistry, 
Planetary Geology and Geophysics, Planetary Atmospheres and Mars 
Fundamental Research, this means a 20-22 month interval from the 
previous due dates in 2013, guaranteeing funding gaps for scientists, 
many of whom will be forced to seek other employment. 

At SBAG, it was announced that the SSW due date might be shifted to 
"summer". To avoid funding gaps this date would optimally be May 2014.

Numerous National Academy and PSS reports state the critical importance 
of stability in the planetary research programs to US solar system 
exploration. Shifting the SSW due date is essential.

The rotation models and internal structure of planets and satellites
The giant planets systems: Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus
The Earth-Moon system: formation, satellites and debris
The small bodies system: evolution and history
The dynamics of asteroids: rotation, binary, satellites
The complex algorithms and tools

Registration is already open, as well as the application for IAU 
grants.

Please contact us for any information at: cps-iau@unamur.be

We are very pleased to welcome you in Namur next July!

AOGS SESSION PS06: ADVANCES IN RADIO AND PLASMA WAVE STUDIES OF 
MAGNETIZED PLANETS

The environment of the magnetized planets of our solar system gained an 
increasing interest over the years, because of the numerous space 
missions that are (NASA's Cassini) or will be (JAXA's SPRINT-A\HISAKI,
NASA's JUNO and ESA's JUICE) studying these systems, and because of the 
discovery of giant extra-solar planets. As planetary emissions driven 
by the magnetosphere interactions (auroral emissions) are most probably 
the only emissions that could be observed from the extra-solar planets, 
the understanding of that from the solar system planets is a key topic 
of planetary sciences. Radio emissions, emitted over a large range of 
distance from the planet, can probe a large region of the magnetosphere 
and trace the coupling between the distant magnetosphere and the planet 
ionosphere. 

The session will discuss recent advances in our understanding of 
planetary magnetospheres, relevant for a number of current and future 
missions.

EGU2014 PLANETARY GEOMORPHOLOGY ABSTRACT DEADLINE JANUARY 16

The abstract deadline is approaching fast for submission to Planetary 
Geomorphology at EGU 2014 (Vienna Austria 27 April - 2 May) GM10.1.

The Planetary Geomorphology session welcomes abstracts concerning 
landforms and the processes that shape them on all solar system bodies. 
Earth analogue studies, flume/simulation work and novel approaches 
using remote sensing data are especially encouraged. This session has 
always provided a stimulating forum for cross-disciplinary discussion 
and we hope you'll join us once again to bring geomorphology and 
planetary science closer together. The final deadline for abstracts is 
16th January 2014.

NASA POSTDOCTORAL FELLOWSHIPS
 
The NASA Postdoctoral Program (NPP) provides opportunities for 
scientists and engineers to conduct research largely of their own 
choosing, yet compatible with the research opportunities posted on the 
NPP Web site.
 
Selected by a competitive peer-review process, NPP Fellows complete 
one- to three-year Fellowship appointments that advance NASA's 
missions in earth science, heliophysics, planetary science, 
astrophysics, space bioscience, aeronautics and engineering, human 
exploration and space operations, and astrobiology.
 
An example of one of the research opportunities in planetary science 
is:
 
https://www3.orau.gov/NPDoc/Catalog/18696         
 
Applicants must have a Ph.D. or equivalent degree in hand before 
beginning the fellowship, but may apply while completing the degree 
requirements. U. S. citizens, Lawful Permanent Residents, and 
foreign nationals eligible for J-1 status as a Research Scholar may 
apply.
 
Stipends start at $53,500 per year, with supplements for high 
cost-of-living areas and for certain academic specialties. Financial 
assistance is available for relocation and health insurance, and 
$8,000 per year is provided for professional travel.

Applications are accepted three times each year: March 1, July 1, and 
November 1.

JOB OPPORTUNITY: STSCI RESEARCH AND INSTRUMENT ANALYSTS

Research and Instrument Analysts (RIAs) will assist Instrument
Scientists in the reduction and analysis of Hubble Space Telescope
calibration data. Analysts will also assist in the development and
testing of the scientific instruments and optical systems for the
James Webb Space Telescope. They will provide User Support to HST
General Observers and Archival Researchers in various aspects of
observation planning and data reduction. Additionally, analysts may
become involved in cutting-edge astronomical research by providing
support for scientific programs of staff scientists. Such support
can involve calibrating data, photometry, spectroscopy, image
drizzling, coding, and laboratory work in astronomical instrumentation.
Successful applicants typically have a Bachelor's, Master's or PhD
degree in Astronomy, Physics, Astrophysics, Planetary Science, or
related fields. The starting position (RIA I, II, Senior) and salary
are commensurate with education and experience. Experience with
astronomical research, instrumentation or optics, scientific computing,
data analysis, and IRAF or other astronomical software packages, is
also desired. Additional mathematical, statistical, and programming
skills (e.g. IDL, python) are a plus.
