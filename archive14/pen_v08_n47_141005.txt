GERRY NEUGEBAUER, 1932-2014

Gerry Neugebauer, an astrophysicist who pioneered ways to peer into 
previously invisible sectors of outer space, helping to discover 
hundreds of thousands of planets, stars and galaxies, died on Sept. 26
in Arizona. In the study of infrared radiation, he was considered a 
father of the field, along with Frank J. Low of the University of 
Arizona.

A major advance came in 1983, when he was the scientific director of 
a satellite mission to collect heavenly data from infrared rays. For 
that project - the Infrared Astronomical Satellite, or IRAS, 
sponsored by NASA, Britain and the Netherlands - he helped develop 
instruments sensitive enough to detect a 20-watt light bulb on Pluto 
or a speck of dust from a mile away.

Dr. Neugebauer was a member of the National Academy of Sciences, the 
American Philosophical Society and the American Academy of Arts and 
Sciences. He received the Space Science Award of the American 
Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, and the Herschel Medal of 
the Royal Astronomical Society in Britain, of which he was a member.

research.

Information about the department and its current research activities 
can be found at: 

http://cos.fit.edu/pss/ 

For more information, interested candidates should contact Dr. Daniel 
Batcheldor, PSS Interim Department Head. To apply, email 
searchpss@fit.edu with the subject "Position # PSS802". In a single 
PDF, provide a cover letter, CV, statements of research and teaching 
experience and interests, and the names and contact information of at 
least three references.  Review of applications will begin on 
January 5, but applications will be accepted until the position is 
filled. Highly qualified applicants may consider applying to our open 
position for the permanent department head. Florida Tech is an equal 
opportunity employer.

POSTDOCTORAL POSITION IN LUNAR RESEARCH

The Department of Physics and Astronomy at the University of Iowa is 
searching for a postdoctoral research scientist to study the 
interaction of the Moon's surface, exosphere, and magnetic fields with 
the space environment. The successful candidate will work in 
collaboration with Prof. Jasper Halekas, as well as other researchers 
from the LADEE and ARTEMIS teams and the DREAM2 node of SSERVI. Details 
and application instructions available at:

[NASA] PDS - LPR MINI-RF DATA RELEASE

On September 29, 2014, the NASA Planetary Data System announced the 
third release of LRO Mini-RF Bistatic Radar observations, including 
data acquired on March 12 and March 14, 2013 (orbits 16938 and 16963). 
To access the above data, please visit this link: 

http://pds.nasa.gov/subscription_service/SS-20140929.html

PDS offers two services for searching the LRO archives:

The Planetary Image Atlas at the Imaging Node allows selection of LRO 
data by specific search criteria:   

http://pds-imaging.jpl.nasa.gov/search/lro/

The Lunar Orbital Data Explorer at the Geosciences Node allows 
searching and downloading of LRO data and other lunar orbital data 
sets (Clementine and Lunar Prospector):

NASA POSTDOCTORAL FELLOWSHIPS

The NASA Postdoctoral Program (NPP) provides opportunities for 
scientists and engineers to conduct research largely of their own 
choosing, yet compatible with the research opportunities posted on the 
NPP Web site.

Selected by a competitive peer-review process, NPP Fellows complete 
one- to three-year Fellowship appointments that advance NASA's missions 
in earth science, heliophysics, planetary science, astrophysics, space 
bioscience, aeronautics and engineering, human exploration and space 
operations, and astrobiology.

An example of one of the research opportunities in planetary science 
is:

https://www3.orau.gov/NPDoc/Catalog/17903

Applicants must have a Ph.D. or equivalent degree in hand before 
beginning the fellowship, but may apply while completing the degree 
requirements. U.S. citizens, Lawful Permanent Residents, and foreign 
nationals eligible for J-1 status as a Research Scholar may apply.

Stipends start at $53,500 per year, with supplements for high 
cost-of-living areas and for certain academic specialties. Financial 
assistance is available for relocation and health insurance, and 
$8,000 per year is provided for professional travel.

Applications are accepted three times each year: March 1, July 1, and 
November 1.

Research Opportunity, NNH14ZHA001N-MIRO. Section H.3.1.4 has been 
edited to include non-tenure track faculty members as eligible 
Principal Investigators of MIRO awards.

NRAO COMMUNITY EVENT AT THE 46TH DPS MEETING

Thursday, November 13th, 12:00 pm - 1:30 pm, Tucson Ballroom G

The National Radio Astronomy Observatory (NRAO) cordially invites you 
to an NRAO Community Event at the 46th DPS meeting. This event is 
specifically designed for the planetary science community, and in 
particular for those who do not regularly utilize radio wavelength 
data in their research. If you would like to learn more about the 
planetary science that is possible with NRAO facilities, this session 
is for you. We will provide a brief overview of the NRAO telescopes 
and their instruments followed by broad talks describing the possible 
planetary science using them at sub-mm, mm and cm wavelengths by 
I. de Pater (Berkeley) and I. Crossfield (U. Arizona). We will also 
provide practical information on how to prepare proposals for the VLA, 
GBT and ALMA.

No registration is required to attend the event but we will provide 
lunch for the first 30 attendees registering on our website. Go to:
