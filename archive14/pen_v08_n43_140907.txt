PLANETARY EXPLORATION NEWSLETTER INVITATION

Dear Colleagues,

You are invited to subscribe to and participate in the Planetary 
Exploration Newsletter (PEN). PEN is a free weekly electronic 
newsletter, provided as a service by the Planetary Science Institute, 
for planetary scientists around the world to communicate with each 
other. The editors are volunteers. PEN contains meeting announcements, 
job announcements, and your submissions of news regarding or impacting 
solar system exploration, upcoming mission events, awards, policy 
issues, as well as editorials and commentary. PEN also includes 
announcements of PDS data releases and ROSES programs and special 
messages to the planetary community from NASA leadership.

The PEN Meeting Calendar (http://planetarynews.org/meetings.html) 
strives to be the most exhaustive listing of planetary-related 
meetings, conferences and workshops around the world. Send the title, 
dates, location and URL to pen_editor at psi.edu.

To subscribe to future mailings, read current and past newsletters,
and see guidelines for submitting content, go to:

PLANETARY SCIENCE SLIDES AND ILLUSTRATIONS

Are you looking for some great slides or illustrations to use in your
presentations? The Planetary Science Research Discoveries website has
sets of Powerpoint slides. These are summaries of PSRD articles
covering the origin of solar systems and the processes by which
planets, moons, and small bodies form and evolve. The slides are
annotated with captions and notes, and are linked to PSRD articles
that provide the full context, additional graphics, and references.
Use our search box to find just what you need.

http://www.psrd.hawaii.edu/Archive/Archive-PSRDpresents.html

The Cosmochemistry Illustrated website offers Powerpoint slides with
planetary examples to enrich any geochemistry, petrology, and
introductory geology lecture. References and background are given in
the notes pages.

ASTEROID IMPACT DEFLECTION ASSESSMENT (AIDA) WORKSHOP, REGISTRATION 
IS NOW OPEN, NEW ABSTRACT DEADLINE

The first International Asteroid Impact Deflection Assessment (AIDA) 
Workshop will be held 15-17 October 2014 in Laurel, Maryland. AIDA 
is a technology demonstration of the kinetic impactor concept. It is 
composed of the DART (Double Asteroid Redirection Test) and AIM 
(Asteroid Impact Mission) spacecrafts, each under consideration by 
NASA and ESA.The combination of both spacecrafts is referred to as 
AIDA.

The registration is now open. Please visit: 

http://www.oca.eu/michel/AIDAWorkshop2014/AIDAWorkshop2014_Register/
AIDAWorkshop2014_Register.html

The deadline for registration is October 8th.

Abstracts are also solicited for participants to the workshop. The 
final deadline for abstract submission is 15 September 2014 
(23:59 EST). Topics include studies relevant to the two concepts 
(DART projectile and AIM rendezvous spacecraft), knowledge of the 
Didymos binary system (the target of the AIDA demonstration), and on 
binary origins, dynamics and properties (e.g. regolith and surface 
characteristics, internal structure), impact observing strategies, 
additional science opportunities during an impact demonstration and 
associated payloads, impact modeling and momentum transfer of an 
artificial projectile, ejecta dynamics, etc.

NASA POSTDOCTORAL FELLOWSHIPS

The NASA Postdoctoral Program (NPP) provides opportunities for 
scientists and engineers to conduct research largely of their own 
choosing, yet compatible with the research opportunities posted on 
the NPP Web site.

Selected by a competitive peer-review process, NPP Fellows complete 
one- to three-year Fellowship appointments that advance NASA's 
missions in earth science, heliophysics, planetary science, 
astrophysics, space bioscience, aeronautics and engineering, human 
exploration and space operations, and astrobiology.

A sample research opportunity is:

https://www3.orau.gov/NPDoc/Catalog/18395

Applicants must have a Ph.D. or equivalent degree in hand before 
beginning the fellowship, but may apply while completing the degree 
requirements. U. S. citizens, Lawful Permanent Residents, and foreign 
nationals eligible for J-1 status as a Research Scholar may apply.

Stipends start at $53,500 per year, with supplements for high cost-
of-living areas and for certain academic specialties. Financial 
assistance is available for relocation and health insurance, and 
$8,000 per year is provided for professional travel.

Applications are accepted three times each year: March 1, July 1, 
and November 1.

IMPACT GEOLOGY RESEARCH OPPORTUNITY OF A MASTER OF SCIENCE DEGREE

Presently, there is an opening for a geology student holding a BS in 
geology to enter the Masters (M.S.) in geology program at Auburn 
University's Department of Geology and Geography and study impact 
geology for his or her thesis research project. Auburn has an impact 
and planetary geology program, where the emphasis is on marine impact 
craters and impact-related stratigraphy. The candidate must have a BS 
in geology or equivalent degree in hand by January 2015, must have 
gained admission to the Graduate School at Auburn, and must agree to 
move to Auburn, Alabama and take up an available teaching assistantship 
and impact-geology research project by the onset of the spring 
semester 2015 (i.e., January 14, 2015). Learn more about Auburn at:

http://www.auburn.edu 

and about the G&G department at:

MESSENGER orbital operations.

MESSENGER's instruments are the Mercury Dual Imaging System (MDIS), 
with wide-angle and narrow-angle cameras for imaging Mercury's surface; 
a Gamma-Ray and Neutron Spectrometer (GRNS) and an X-Ray Spectrometer 
(XRS) for remote geochemical mapping; a Magnetometer (MAG) to measure 
the planetary magnetic field; a Mercury Laser Altimeter (MLA) to 
measure surface topography and planetary shape; the Mercury 
Atmospheric and Surface Composition Spectrometer (MASCS), combining 
an Ultraviolet and Visible Spectrometer (UVVS) with a Visible and 
Infrared Spectrograph (VIRS) to make high-resolution spectral 
measurements of the surface and to survey the structure and 
composition of Mercury's tenuous neutral exosphere; and an Energetic 
Particle and Plasma Spectrometer (EPPS) to characterize the charged 
particle and plasma environment of Mercury.
