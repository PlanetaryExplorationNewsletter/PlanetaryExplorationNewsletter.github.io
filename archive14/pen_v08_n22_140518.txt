POSTDOCTORAL RESEARCHER IN MARTIAN ATMOPSHERIC/PLANETARY SCIENCE AT
YORK UNIVERSITY

A postdoctoral researcher is sought at York University in Toronto, 
Canada to help support the operations of the Mars Science Laboratory 
Rover Curiosity, to lead investigations into the Martian Atmosphere 
using spacecraft data, and to lead experimental investigations into 
atmosphere-surface interactions of planetary bodies, including but not 
limited to Mars. The successful candidate must be eligible to become a 
member of the Science and Operations Team of MSL as well as a member 
of the NSERC Integrating Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics from Earth 
to Space (IACPES) CREATE program. The term of employment will be for 
one year with an option to extend this work to two years pending 
funding. This term will begin no earlier than July 1st, 2014 and no 
later than January 1st, 2015.

How to Apply: 
Please send to both jmoores@yorku.ca and whiteway@yorku.ca:

(1) a detailed C.V., 
(2) the names, phone numbers and email addresses of at least two 
    references who have agreed to speak on your behalf and 
(3) two examples of published work that you have led. 

For full consideration, please send these materials by June 15th, 
2014, however, this position will remain open until filled.

PLANETARY RINGS WORKSHOP

The Cassini Rings Working Group will host a Planetary Rings Workshop
13-15 August, 2014 in Boulder, CO at the CU's Laboratory for
Atmospheric and Space Physics (CU-LASP). The workshop will be open to
all interested parties and any observational or theoretical research
on the properties, dynamics, origin or evolution of any planetary
ring system is appropriate. This meeting will highlight the latest
Cassini results. We plan on predominantly oral talks, but posters will
be considered. Ample time will be allowed for discussion. Previous
workshops were held in Ithaca (2011), Paris (2008) and Whitefish,
MT (2006). The first announcement is posted at LASP's event website:

http://lasp.colorado.edu/cassini/PlanetaryRingsWorkshopAug2014.html
 
Registration will be by credit card through Eventbrite. Details will
follow in 2nd announcement and will be posted on the above meeting
site. (Please email Laura Bloom (address below) if you would like to be
placed on our mailing list and receive a direct email invitation once
registration opens.) Planned program includes an opening reception
Tuesday evening, a workshop dinner on Wednesday, and working lunch on
Friday. The meeting will end Friday evening. Estimated costs are $100
for the workshop and $30 for the dinner.

NASA POSTDOCTORAL FELLOWSHIPS

The NASA Postdoctoral Program (NPP) provides opportunities for 
scientists and engineers to conduct research largely of their own 
choosing, yet compatible with the research opportunities posted on the 
NPP Web site.

Selected by a competitive peer-review process, NPP Fellows complete 
one- to three-year Fellowship appointments that advance NASA's missions 
in earth science, heliophysics, planetary science, astrophysics, space 
bioscience, aeronautics and engineering, human exploration and space 
operations, and astrobiology.

An example of one of the research opportunities in planetary science 
is:

https://www3.orau.gov/NPDoc/Catalog/17903

Applicants must have a Ph.D. or equivalent degree in hand before 
beginning the fellowship, but may apply while completing the degree 
requirements. U.S. citizens, Lawful Permanent Residents, and foreign 
nationals eligible for J-1 status as a Research Scholar may apply.

Stipends start at $53,500 per year, with supplements for high 
cost-of-living areas and for certain academic specialties. Financial 
assistance is available for relocation and health insurance, and 
$8,000 per year is provided for professional travel.

Applications are accepted three times each year: March 1, July 1, 
and November 1.
