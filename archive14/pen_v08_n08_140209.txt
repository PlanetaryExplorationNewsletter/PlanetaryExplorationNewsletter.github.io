COSPAR SESSION B0.1: LUNAR SCIENCE AND EXPLORATION

Call for papers

COSPAR 2014 Moscow, August 2-10
Abstract submission date: Feb. 14

Lunar science and exploration are having a renaissance with as many 
as ten missions sent to Moon during the last one decade itself. This 
session is aimed at discussing new progress in lunar science from 
recent missions, latest science results, newer insight into our 
understanding of Moon, modeling and synthesis of different scientific 
data, future missions, and science questions. It will include invited, 
contributed, and poster papers. Papers on new lunar mission concepts, 
instrumentation for the future lunar missions, and human lunar 
exploration are also welcome in this session.

COSPAR SESSION C5.2: DUSTY PLASMAS IN SPACE

Call for papers
 
The scope of this session includes two areas of research regarding 
"Dusty Plasmas in Space": (1) the wide range of naturally occurring 
dusty plasmas in the Universe, such as those present in the 
interstellar medium, in star and planet formation, in the solar 
system, and in the Earth's atmosphere, and (2) man-made dusty plasmas 
under microgravity conditions, e.g., experiments on the International 
Space Station designed to observe basic dusty plasma processes such 
as strong coupling phenomena. This session aims to provide an 
opportunity for an exchange of technical know-how, and theoretical 
and experimental ideas in order to further the development of dusty 
plasma research as a whole.

CALL FOR PAPERS - ICARUS SPECIAL ISSUE: LUNAR VOLATILES

In the past five years, the paradigm of lunar volatiles research has
shifted from hypothesizing on the existence of volatiles on the Moon 
to classifying the abundance and distribution of different types of 
volatiles on the Moon. This special issue reports work advancing the 
understanding of volatiles in, on, and around the Moon including the 
primordial inventory, volatile additions and losses throughout the 
history of the Moon, and the current inventory of volatiles. 
Manuscripts publishing spacecraft data relevant to mapping and 
quantifying lunar volatiles are sought. In addition, papers focused 
on the processes related to the storage, maintenance, migration, 
delivery, or removal of volatiles are appropriate. The special issue 
solicits submissions containing new scientific research via laboratory 
studies, remote sensing, data analysis, modeling, sample analysis, or 
theoretical investigations. Topics of interest include, but are NOT
limited to:
 
Composition and spatial distribution of volatiles
Timing of volatile emplacement and removal
Processes involving lunar volatiles
Comparative analysis of volatiles on different solar system objects

NASA SEMINAR SERIES ON NEAR-EARTH ASTEROIDS
 
Curious about NASA’s Grand Challenge to "discover all asteroids that 
could threaten human populations and find out how to deal with them?" 

NASA is sponsoring a series of seminars on the properties of Near 
Earth Asteroids (NEAs) to provide information of interest to 
astronomers (amateur and professional), students, teachers, and others 
who are potentially interested in contributing to studies of NEAs. The 
seminars will be held at 11am(Eastern) on the second and fourth Fridays 
of each month. Information on how to join these seminars is posted at:

http://sservi.nasa.gov/agc-seminar-series/

The first 5 speakers are:
 
- Feb 14 Lindley Johnson (NASA Headquarters):
NASA's NEA programs
 
- Feb 28 David Morrison (NASA Ames & SSERVI):
History of impacts research and planetary defense
 
- Mar 14 Paul Chodas (NEO Program Office at JPL):
NEA discovery, orbit calculation and impact probability
 
- Mar 28 Alan Harris (JPL retired): NEA populations and impact 
frequency
 
- Apr 11 Dan Britt (University of Central Florida): Physical 
properties of NEAs
 
This seminar series is sponsored by The NASA Asteroid Grand Challenge 
Office, with the NASA Near Earth Object Observations Program and the 
NASA Solar System Exploration Research Virtual Institute (SSERVI).

NASA POSTDOCTORAL FELLOWSHIPS
 
The NASA Postdoctoral Program (NPP) provides opportunities for 
scientists and engineers to conduct research largely of their own 
choosing, yet compatible with the research opportunities posted on the 
NPP Web site.
 
Selected by a competitive peer-review process, NPP Fellows complete 
one- to three-year Fellowship appointments that advance NASA’s missions 
in earth science, heliophysics, planetary science, astrophysics, space 
bioscience, aeronautics and engineering, human exploration and space 
operations, and astrobiology.
 
An example of one of the research opportunities in planetary science 
is:
 
https://www3.orau.gov/NPDoc/Catalog/18115 
 
Applicants must have a Ph.D. or equivalent degree in hand before 
beginning the fellowship, but may apply while completing the degree 
requirements. U. S. citizens, Lawful Permanent Residents, and foreign 
nationals eligible for J-1 status as a Research Scholar may apply.
 
Stipends start at $53,500 per year, with supplements for high cost-
of-living areas and for certain academic specialties. Financial 
assistance is available for relocation and health insurance, and 
$8,000 per year is provided for professional travel.

Applications are accepted three times each year: March 1, July 1, 
and November 1.

SESSION TO IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF YOUR NASA PROPOSALS

Curious about how to improve the quality of the proposals you send to 
NASA? Ever wonder what the review panel is really looking for when it 
reviews that proposal? The Planetary Science Division at NASA 
Headquarters is offering a Proposal Writing Workshop at LPSC that is 
based on the cumulative experience of current and former Discipline 
Scientists who have managed a variety of Research and Announcement 
(R&A) programs at NASA Headquarters. The specific focus of this 
intense, educational session is to provide a greater understanding of 
NASA's research programs and review process and offer constructive and 
practical insight into writing an effective research proposal. The 
event is open to all at no charge and will be held on Sunday, March 
16, from 12-4 pm in Waterway 1. All interested planetary scientists, 
from graduate students through emeritus professors, are encouraged to 
attend.
 
To register, send an e-mail with your name, affiliation, and current 
position to curt.niebur@nasa.gov.

MARS CRITICAL DATA PRODUCTS PROGRAM (ROUND IX) - MARS 2020

Initial Landing Site Characterization for the Mars 2020 Rover Mission
 
The Mars Exploration Program has issued, in January 2014, a Request for 
Proposal for round IX of the Mars Critical Data Products program.  This 
RFP provides support for initial landing site surface, atmosphere, and 
gravity characterization for the Mars 2020 rover mission. The intent is 
to convert mission data and numerical simulations into products focused 
on specific landing site targets (to be provided by the program) that 
will be useful for reducing the risk to the Mars 2020 rover mission. 
Proposals are due on Wednesday, March 5, 2014.
 
Details of the RFPs are posted at:

INTERVIEW WITH, FRANK DRAKE, THE FOUNDER OF SETI, NOW ON YOUTUBE

As part of the celebration of the beginning of the 30th year of the 
SETI Institute, a 2012 interview with the "father of SETI science," 
astronomer Frank Drake, is now available on YouTube at: 

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HPQz-kdaxNo
 
The interview was conducted by SETI Institute Board Member and veteran 
astronomy educator Andrew Fraknoi at SETICon II in June 2012. The 
discussion ranges widely over Dr. Drake's career and current thinking, 
and includes reminiscences of Project OZMA (the very first experiment 
searching for signals from civilizations among the stars) and his 
current view of the Drake Equation (estimating the chances of 
intelligent life out there). He also reflects on a number of modern 
developments, including the discovery of numerous planets orbiting 
other stars and novel ways of searching for extra-terrestrial 
civilizations.

The audience at this special event received a reprint of Frank Drake's 
personal history of the Drake Equation, published by the Astronomical 
Society of the Pacific. Because of its historical importance, this 
article is now available freely on the web at: 

http://www.astrosociety.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/ab2010-46.pdf
