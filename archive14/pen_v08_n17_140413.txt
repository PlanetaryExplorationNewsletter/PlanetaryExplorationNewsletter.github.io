NASA POSTDOCTORAL FELLOWSHIPS
 
The NASA Postdoctoral Program (NPP) provides opportunities for 
scientists and engineers to conduct research largely of their own 
choosing, yet compatible with the research opportunities posted on 
the NPP Web site.
 
Selected by a competitive peer-review process, NPP Fellows complete 
one- to three-year Fellowship appointments that advance NASA's 
missions in earth science, heliophysics, planetary science, 
astrophysics, space bioscience, aeronautics and engineering, human 
exploration and space operations, and astrobiology.
 
An example of one of the research opportunities in planetary science 
is:
 
https://www3.orau.gov/NPDoc/Catalog/17903
 
Applicants must have a Ph.D. or equivalent degree in hand before 
beginning the fellowship, but may apply while completing the degree 
requirements. U. S. citizens, Lawful Permanent Residents, and foreign 
nationals eligible for J-1 status as a Research Scholar may apply.
 
Stipends start at $53,500 per year, with supplements for high cost-of-
living areas and for certain academic specialties. Financial 
assistance is available for relocation and health insurance, and 
$8,000 per year is provided for professional travel.

Applications are accepted three times each year: March 1, July 1, and 
November 1.

FIRST ANNOUNCEMENT - LUNGRADCON 2014

Registration is now open for the 5th Annual Lunar and Small Bodies 
Graduate Conference (LunGradCon 2014) to be held on Saturday and 
Sunday, July 19-20, 2014 at the NASA Ames Research Center (ARC), 
preceding the NASA Exploration Science Forum. LunGradCon provides an 
opportunity for grad students and early-career postdocs to present 
their research on lunar and small body science in a low-stress, 
friendly environment, being critiqued only by their peers. In addition 
to oral presentations, the conference presents opportunities for 
professional development and networking with fellow grad students and 
postdocs, as well as senior members of the NASA Solar System 
Exploration Research Virtual Institute. A limited amount of funding 
will be provided for travel and lodging costs.

PLANETARY GIS DATA SPECIALIST

The Planetary Geographic Information System (GIS)/Data Specialist
will work in a new Planetary Science research group led by Edwin Kite
in the University of Chicago's Department of Geophysical Sciences. The
central objective of the research group is to use geologic data to
reconstruct the past climate history of Mars and understand the
physical mechanisms responsible for the loss of Mars habitability. The
primary job responsibilities are: 
(1) to assemble planetary data into "research ready" ArcGIS projected 
mosaics, and 
(2) to generate, evaluate and analyze planetary digital terrain models 
that incorporate stereo data. 

Salary will be commensurate with the experience and qualifications of 
the successful candidate. A start date in the range 1/1/2015 - 
3/31/2015 is preferred. Later start dates may be negotiated. For
