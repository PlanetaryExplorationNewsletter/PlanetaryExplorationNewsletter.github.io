EIGHTH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON MARS - PROGRAM NOW AVAILABLE

Greetings Mars Community!
 
Below is a link to the program for the Eighth International Conference 
on Mars. It maps out the exciting sequence of talks and events for all 
five days.
 
There is no fee to attend the conference, but registration is strongly 
encouraged! It helps us properly welcome you by making sure that we 
have an accurate headcount for conference materials, refreshments, 
etc. The link to the registration form is also found below.

NASA POSTDOCTORAL FELLOWSHIPS

The NASA Postdoctoral Program (NPP) provides opportunities for 
scientists and engineers to conduct research largely of their own 
choosing, yet compatible with the research opportunities posted on the 
NPP Web site.
 
Selected by a competitive peer-review process, NPP Fellows complete 
one- to three-year Fellowship appointments that advance NASA's missions 
in earth science, heliophysics, planetary science, astrophysics, space 
bioscience, aeronautics and engineering, human exploration and space 
operations, and astrobiology.
 
An example of one of the research opportunities in planetary science 
is:
 
https://www3.orau.gov/NPDoc/Catalog/18421  
 
Applicants must have a Ph.D. or equivalent degree in hand before 
beginning the fellowship, but may apply while completing the degree 
requirements. U.S. citizens, Lawful Permanent Residents, and foreign 
nationals eligible for J-1 status as a Research Scholar may apply.
 
Stipends start at $53,500 per year, with supplements for high cost-of-
living areas and for certain academic specialties. Financial assistance 
is available for relocation and health insurance, and $8,000 per year 
is provided for professional travel.

Applications are accepted three times each year: March 1, July 1, and 
November 1.

OBSERVING CAMPAIGN TO STUDY COMET 2013 A1 (SIDING SPRING)

C/Siding Spring will fly within 135,000 km of Mars on 19 October 2014. 
Measurements leading to increased understanding of its orbit, nucleus 
size, density, strength, rotation rate, composition, coma and tail 
morphology, and evolution over time are highly encouraged, especially 
around Mars closest approach. These observations will also contribute 
to the studies of the interactions between the Martian atmosphere and 
cometary dust and volatiles, relevant to understanding the delivery of 
cometary water and organics to inner planets. The comet is best 
observed from the Southern hemisphere, and will appear brightest to 
Earth based observers in mid-September 2014 ([V_min] ~ 10). In order 
to facilitate the maximal observing of Siding Spring, we are holding a 
1-day observers' workshop/telecon on 11 Aug 2014, and Mars fleet pre-
encounter tag-up workshop/telecon on 19 Sept 2014. Everyone is welcome 
to attend and discuss their observing plans, needs, and results. We 
will also be supporting a post-encounter special session at the Fall 
2014 AGU meeting in San Francisco.

Spring, please visit the CIOC Campaign webpage at:

INPUT REQUESTED FOR AGU SCIENTIFIC TRENDS SURVEY

Dear Colleagues:
 
The American Geophysical Union is asking for input to their Scientific 
Trends Survey, from the broader scientific community, and indeed, 
beyond. Its purpose: to help identify recent and currently emerging 
trends for Earth and Space science. The full charge to the trends task 
force can be found at:

http://sites.agu.org/leadership/committees/council-committees/
scientific-trends-task-force/

Please take a view minutes to visit the survey at:

https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/AGUScientificTrends2014

The survey will close on or around this Friday, 20 June. Your opinions 
will be valued.
 
Bill McKinnon, on behalf of the AGU Planetary Sciences section

ENCELADUS: A HABITABLE WORLD - SPECIAL SESSION AT FALL 2014 AGU 
MEETING  

Session Title: Enceladus: A Habitable World 
Session ID: #1492 
Conveners: Carolyn Porco, Chris McKay

Geysers of icy particles and vapor, with trace amounts of organic 
compounds, erupting from warm fractures and deriving from a salty, 
subsurface sea make the Saturnian moon Enceladus the most accessible 
extraterrestrial habitable zone in our solar system. In this special 
session, now in its 9th year, we continue our focus on those topics 
relating to the origin and state of the moon's geologically active 
south polar terrain (SPT). These include observational, theoretical 
and modeling investigations of the composition, state, and dynamics 
of Enceladus' jets and plume, its thermal and interior state and 
evolution, and the geomorphology of the SPT and similar provinces. We 
also welcome studies addressing future spaceflight missions and the 
moon's potential for biological activity.

If you love Enceladus as much as we do, and you have new results that 
fit the topics above, and you're eager to share them with other 
Enceladus fans, please consider submitting an abstract to this special 
AGU session. 

The deadline for abstracts is August 6, 2014. 

Hope to see you in San Francisco!
