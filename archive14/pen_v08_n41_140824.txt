ASTEROID IMPACT DEFLECTION ASSESSMENT (AIDA) WORKSHOP ABSTRACT DEADLINE

The first International Asteroid Impact Deflection Assessment (AIDA) 
Workshop will be held 15-17 October 2014 in Laurel, Maryland. AIDA is 
a technology demonstration of the kinetic impactor concept. It is 
composed of the DART (Double Asteroid Redirection Test) and AIM 
(Asteroid Impact Mission) spacecrafts, each under consideration by 
NASA and ESA. The combination of both spacecrafts is referred to as 
AIDA.

Abstracts are solicited for participants to the workshop. Topics 
include studies relevant to the two concepts (DART projectile and AIM 
rendezvous spacecraft), knowledge of the Didymos binary system (the 
target of the AIDA demonstration), and on binary origins, dynamics 
and properties (e.g. regolith and surface characteristics, internal 
structure), impact observing strategies, additional science 
opportunities during an impact demonstration and associated payloads, 
impact modeling and momentum transfer of an artificial projectile, 
ejecta dynamics, etc.

Abstracts are due 1 September 2014. Please visit:

for further details, including abstract format.

NASA POSTDOCTORAL FELLOWSHIPS

The NASA Postdoctoral Program (NPP) provides opportunities for 
scientists and engineers to conduct research largely of their own 
choosing, yet compatible with the research opportunities posted on the 
NPP Web site.

Selected by a competitive peer-review process, NPP Fellows complete 
one- to three-year Fellowship appointments that advance NASA's missions 
in earth science, heliophysics, planetary science, astrophysics, space 
bioscience, aeronautics and engineering, human exploration and space 
operations, and astrobiology.

An example of one of the research opportunities in planetary science 
is:

https://www3.orau.gov/NPDoc/Catalog/18696  

Applicants must have a Ph.D. or equivalent degree in hand before 
beginning the fellowship, but may apply while completing the degree 
requirements. U.S. citizens, Lawful Permanent Residents, and foreign 
nationals eligible for J-1 status as a Research Scholar may apply.

Stipends start at $53,500 per year, with supplements for high 
cost-of-living areas and for certain academic specialties. Financial 
assistance is available for relocation and health insurance, and 
$8,000 per year is provided for professional travel.

Applications are accepted three times each year: March 1, July 1, and 
November 1.

MAVEN POSTDOCTORAL RESEARCHER IN MARS MAGNETIC FIELDS

(NASA-GSFC/CRESST/University of Maryland)

Applications are now being accepted for a Postdoctoral Research 
Associate, funded through the University of Maryland College Park 
(UMCP) and the Center for Research and Exploration in Space Science 
and Technology (CRESST), to work in the Planetary Magnetospheres 
Laboratory of the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) 
investigating Mars magnetic fields using data from the MAVEN (Mars 
Atmosphere and Volatile EvolutioN) mission. Additional details are 
available at: 

http://www.astro.umd.edu/employment/

The appointment will be initially for one year, with the possibility 
of renewal in subsequent years. Candidates should have a Ph.D. in a 
relevant discipline with experience conducting scientific research 
related to the MAVEN science objectives or the types of instruments 
included in the MAVEN science payload. Disciplined IDL and Fortran 
programming skills, demonstrated scientific writing ability, and 
experience in acquisition and analysis of data (especially magnetometer 
data) from space flight instruments are highly desirable.

The University of Maryland is an equal opportunity employer. All 
applications received by September 1, 2014 will receive full 
consideration.

FARINELLA PRIZE 2014: ANNOUNCEMENT OF THE WINNER

The Board of the 2014 Paolo Farinella Prize, composed by B. Bottke, 
F. Mignard, A. Rossi, D.J. Scheeres and G.B. Valsecchi, has unanimously 
awarded Prof. David Vokrouhlicky (Charles University, Prague, 
Czeck Republic) the Prize for 2014, on the topic "Non-Gravitational 
Forces in the Solar System".

A close collaborator and friend of Farinella, David shared Paolo's 
interest in the dynamics of both artificial and natural celestial 
bodies exploiting an interdisciplinary approach to enrich both 
disciplines.

David and Paolo Farinella were the first to set forth a unified 
version of the Yarkovsky effect (the diurnal and seasonal brands) and 
to draw a bold conclusion at that time regarding the importance of 
this kind of radiation forces in the orbital evolution of asteroids. 
At that time when radiation forces were seen relevant only for dust 
particles, David and Paolo set a new paradigm by showing that these 
tiny forces could drive minor bodies into the internal region of the 
solar system and be responsible for triggering their capture into 
resonances.

The Prize will be delivered to Prof. Vokrouhlicky in a Special Prize 
Session during the 2014 EPSC in Cascais, Portugal (September 7-12, 
2014).
