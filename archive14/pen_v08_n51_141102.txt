DPS WORKSHOP:  SOLAR SYSTEM OBSERVATIONS WITH THE K2 MISSION 

K2 will use an innovative way of operating the Kepler spacecraft to 
observe target fields along the ecliptic for the next 2–3 years. Early 
science commissioning observations have shown an estimated photometric 
precision near 150 ppm in a single 30 minute observation, and a 6-hr 
photometric precision of 40 ppm (both at V = 12). The K2 mission 
offers long-term, simultaneous optical observations of thousands of 
objects at a precision far better than is achievable from ground-based 
telescopes.  K2 will provide limited opportunities for solar system 
observations. Generally, slow moving sources and major planets between 
V=4 and 20 will be possible targets. K2 has a funded GO program 
accepting proposals twice a year.

The NASA Planetary Science and Astrophysics divisions are holding a 
joint workshop at the 46th Annual Meeting of the Division for Planetary 
Sciences in Tucson. The workshop is: 

Tuesday, November 11, 2014 from 10:00 AM - 12:00 PM
Arizona Ballroom 1-4

This workshop will consist of: 
1) Presentations on the K2 mission as well as Solar System observations 
with the mission, and 
2) Discussion with the broader community to identify observatory 
capabilities and envision future opportunities.

NASA POSTDOCTORAL FELLOWSHIPS
 
The NASA Postdoctoral Program (NPP) provides opportunities for 
scientists and engineers to conduct research largely of their own 
choosing, yet compatible with the research opportunities posted on the 
NPP Web site.
 
Selected by a competitive peer-review process, NPP Fellows complete 
one- to three-year Fellowship appointments that advance NASA’s missions 
in earth science, heliophysics, planetary science, astrophysics, space 
bioscience, aeronautics and engineering, human exploration and space 
operations, and astrobiology.
 
An example of one of the research opportunities in planetary science 
is:
 
https://www3.orau.gov/NPDoc/Catalog/17736
 
Applicants must have a Ph.D. or equivalent degree in hand before 
beginning the fellowship, but may apply while completing the degree 
requirements. U. S. citizens, Lawful Permanent Residents, and foreign 
nationals eligible for J-1 status as a Research Scholar may apply.
 
Stipends start at $53,500 per year, with supplements for high cost-
of-living areas and for certain academic specialties. Financial 
assistance is available for relocation and health insurance, and 
$8,000 per year is provided for professional travel.

Applications are accepted three times each year: March 1, July 1, and 
November 1.

[NASA] ROSES-14 CANCELATION OF E.4: OPPORTUNITIES IN EDUCATION AND 
PUBLIC OUTREACH FOR EARTH AND SPACE SCIENCES

On release of ROSES-14 in February, 2014, E.4 was listed as TBD with 
the intention to release Opportunities in Education and Public 
Outreach for Earth and Space Sciences. However, changing priorities 
and plans of how best to solicit Education and Public Outreach, has 
resulted in a change of plans. Instead, SMD has announced plans to 
release a Science Education Cooperative Agreement Notice that covers 
related subject matter.

This Amendment to the NASA Research Announcement "Research 
Opportunities in Space and Earth Sciences (ROSES) 2014" (NNH14ZDA001N) 
is posted on the NASA research opportunity homepage at:

http://nspires.nasaprs.com/ 

and will appear on the RSS feed at:

roses-2014

Questions concerning E.4, the EPOESS program element may be directed 
to Stephanie Stockman at stephanie.a.stockman@nasa.gov.

POSTDOC POSITION AT LOWELL OBSERVATORY

Applications are invited for a postdoctoral research position at 
Lowell Observatory.  The postdoc will work with Dr. Will Grundy on
observational studies of icy outer Solar System bodies, include 
planning and conducting new observations, data reduction, 
interpretation, and publication of results.  Several interrelated 
projects are envisioned, including Hubble Space Telescope (HST) 
spectroscopy of Pluto and Charon coordinated with the New Horizons 
encounter, HST imaging of Kuiper belt binaries, and ground-based 
observations using Lowell's new 4.3 m Discovery Channel Telescope.  
Observing time will be requested on other facilities as needed, and 
supporting laboratory studies can be done in the Astrophysical Ice 
Laboratory at Northern Arizona University (NAU).

The initial appointment is for one year with an automatic extension 
to two years in the case of satisfactory progress.  Extension to a 
third year is possible contingent on availability of funding.  The 
position comes with a competitive salary and full benefits.
