[NASA] 2014 NASA EONS SOLICITATION NEW APPENDIX
 
NASA's Office of Education is accepting new proposals under the 
Education Opportunities in NASA STEM (EONS) 2014 NASA Research 
Announcement for the MUREP Institutional Research Opportunity (MIRO) 
appendix. This effort was previously titled as the NASA University 
Research Centers Project and has now been consolidated into the MUREP 
Program within the NASA Office of Education. Through the EONS omnibus 
solicitation, the opportunity MIRO has been released. Overall, MIRO 
awards aim to promote Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math 
(STEM) literacy and to enhance and sustain the capability of minority 
serving institutions to perform NASA-related research and education, 
which directly supports NASA's four Mission Directorates – Aeronautics 
Research, Human Exploration and Space Operations, Science, and Space 
Technology. Proposals are due November 12, 2014.
 
For more information regarding the MIRO Solicitation, please visit

[NASA] RELEASE OF A NEW CALL UNDER D.11 NUSTAR GUEST OBSERVER - 
CYCLE 1

The Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array (NuSTAR) Small Explorer 
(SMEX) mission is the first orbiting telescope to focus light in the 
high energy X-ray region of the electromagnetic spectrum (E > 10 keV),
with an effective bandpass of 3 – 79 keV. The observatory provides a 
combined improvement in sensitivity and spatial/spectral resolution by 
factors of 10 to 100 over previous missions that have operated at 
these energies. The NuSTAR Guest Observer (GO) Program solicits 
proposals for basic research relevant to the NuSTAR mission. The 
initial round of Guest Observations (Cycle 1) will commence on or about 
April 1, 2015, and last for a nominal period of 12 months. Further 
details on the Cycle 1 program may be found on the NuSTAR Guest 
Observer Program website (http://nustar.gsfc.nasa.gov). Observing time 
will be made available to scientists at both U.S. and non-U.S. 
institutions.
 
NOIs are not requested. The due date for proposals is November 25, 
2014.

Opportunities in Space and Earth Sciences (ROSES)-2014" (NNH14ZDA001N)

JWST WORKSHOP ON POTENTIAL SCIENCE INVESTIGATIONS

9 November from 1-4 pm (prior to DPS meeting)
 
The Science Working Group of the James Webb Space Telescope has a 
dedicated effort to establish the capabilities of this facility for 
Solar System Science and would like to invite you to participate in a 
workshop being held at the 46th DPS Meeting in November. In order to 
fully realize the potential of JWST for Solar System observations, we 
have organized 10 focus groups including: Asteroids, Comets, Giant 
Planets, Mars, NEOs, Occultations, Rings, Satellites, Titan, and TNOs, 
to explore various science use cases. The findings from these groups 
will help guide the project as it develops and implements tools so that 
they enable a broad range of investigations. This workshop will consist 
of: presentations from the focus groups, and discussion with the 
broader community. More information on this workshop, including remote 
participation details can be found in: 

http://www.stsci.edu/jwst/science/solar-system
 
We also want to encourage the community to consider supporting 
observations with current facilities to prepare for future observations 
with JWST. The Spitzer Cycle 11 call is now available (Due October 29) 
and notes a priority for Solar System observations and developing the 
scientific landscape for JWST.

NASA POSTDOCTORAL FELLOWSHIPS
 
The NASA Postdoctoral Program (NPP) provides opportunities for 
scientists and engineers to conduct research largely of their own 
choosing, yet compatible with the research opportunities posted on the 
NPP Web site.
 
Selected by a competitive peer-review process, NPP Fellows complete 
one- to three-year Fellowship appointments that advance NASA’s 
missions in earth science, heliophysics, planetary science, 
astrophysics, space bioscience, aeronautics and engineering, human 
exploration and space operations, and astrobiology.
 
An example of one of the research opportunities in planetary science 
is:
 
https://www3.orau.gov/NPDoc/Catalog/17903
 
Applicants must have a Ph.D. or equivalent degree in hand before 
beginning the fellowship, but may apply while completing the degree 
requirements. U. S. citizens, Lawful Permanent Residents, and foreign 
nationals eligible for J-1 status as a Research Scholar may apply.
 
Stipends start at $53,500 per year, with supplements for high cost-of-
living areas and for certain academic specialties. Financial assistance 
is available for relocation and health insurance, and $8,000 per year 
is provided for professional travel.

Applications are accepted three times each year: March 1, July 1, and 
November 1.
