[NASA] NEW DRAFT VERSIONS OF ROSES-2014 SECTIONS

The Planetary Science Division (PSD) has posted at: 

http://www.lpi.usra.edu/PSD-RandA/ 

new draft versions of the following ROSES-2014 Appendices: C.1 The 
Overview, C.2 Emerging Worlds, C.3 Solar System Workings, a table of 
tentative proposal due dates, and a FAQ that addresses questions 
concerning proposing after the reorganization. The posted versions of 
Emerging Worlds and Solar System Workings incorporate clarifications 
requested by the community following the open-comment period and the 
January Planetary Science Subcommittee meeting. Appendix C.1, The 
Overview, contains the descriptions of the Planetary Science Division 
program elements and contains other information that is shared by 
multiple program elements, such as the two-step proposal process.
 
If you have any comments or feedback on the posted documents, please 
direct them to the Program Officer in charge of the relevant program 
element or, if that is not clear, please feel free to send them to 
Jonathan Rall, the PSD R&A Lead, at jonathan.rall@nasa.gov
