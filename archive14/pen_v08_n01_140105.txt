TITAN THROUGH TIME WORKSHOP 3

A workshop on Titan's Past, Present and Future, 8-10 April, 2014
Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory, Laurel, MD, USA

Abstracts, student support applications, and registration
(no cost, but required for limited-size facility) are due 
February 2nd, 2014. Go to:

ICUBESAT 2014

27-28 May 2014, Pasadena, USA

iCubeSat 2014, the 3rd Interplanetary CubeSat Workshop, will address
the technical challenges, opportunities, and practicalities of
interplanetary space exploration with CubeSats. The workshop provides
a unique environment for open wide ranging practical collaboration
between academic researchers, industry professionals, policy makers
and students developing this new and rapidly growing field.

Details and registration:

MSL/CHEMCAM/LIBS RECALIBRATED DATA IN PDS MSL RELEASE 4; USER WORKSHOP

The recently available PDS MSL/ChemCam Release 4 includes recalibrated 
laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) compositional data from 
75,210 spectra representing 2,256 observation points in 258 targets 
in Gale crater. The recalibration gives more representative elemental 
compositions from the entire mission. The data set includes active 
spectra on soils and rocks, including laser depth profiles; passive 
spectra on soils, rocks, and atmosphere; and Remote Micro-Imager 
(RMI) high resolution images. The data volume delivered in Release 4, 
including recalibrated files, is 7.7 GB. Potential LIBS data users 
should read the caveats carefully and consult recent publications, 
as this is a new technique. Further refinement of the data is possible.

To help familiarize potential new users a short MSL LIBS Data Users 
Workshop is being planned in conjunction with the Lunar & Planetary 
Science Conference in Houston in March. The contact is Roger Wiens 
(rwiens@lanl.gov). More information and announcements will be 
available closer to the time of the meeting.

The ChemCam data can be found at:

ANNOUNCEMENT OF AVAILABILITY OF DAWN DATA OVER THE WEB

The Dawn project is pleased to announce that it has created a website 
where the public can freely access and download data and documentation 

http://dawndata.igpp.ucla.edu

Most of the data provided here are identical to the products provided 
by the Planetary Data System (PDS). However, the meta-data provided 
has been augmented to include geometry information in both the Dawn 
Claudia and the Claudia Double Prime coordinate systems. All of the 
Dawn publications cite the Dawn Claudia system while the PDS site only 
provides metadata in the Claudia Double Prime system. This site is a 
work in progress. Many of the data sets that have been certified by 
the PDS but still have liens against the metadata are not yet 
available here. These data will be accessible from this site once the 
data are fully archived by the PDS.

NASA POSTDOCTORAL FELLOWSHIPS

The NASA Postdoctoral Program (NPP) provides opportunities for 
scientists and engineers to conduct research largely of their own 
choosing, yet compatible with the research opportunities posted on 
the NPP Web site.

Selected by a competitive peer-review process, NPP Fellows complete 
one- to three-year Fellowship appointments that advance NASA's 
missions in earth science, heliophysics, planetary science, 
astrophysics, space bioscience, aeronautics and engineering, human 
exploration and space operations, and astrobiology.

An example research opportunities is:

https://www3.orau.gov/NPDoc/Catalog/18395

Applicants must have a Ph.D. or equivalent degree in hand before 
beginning the fellowship, but may apply while completing the degree 
requirements. U. S. citizens, Lawful Permanent Residents, and foreign 
nationals eligible for J-1 status as a Research Scholar may apply.

Stipends start at $53,500 per year, with supplements for high cost-
of-living areas and for certain academic specialties. Financial 
assistance is available for relocation and health insurance, and 
$8,000 per year is provided for professional travel.

Applications are accepted three times each year: March 1, July 1, 
and November 1.

2014 NASA PLANETARY SCIENCE SUMMER SCHOOL APPLICATIONS OPEN

NASA is accepting applications from science and engineering post-docs, 
recent PhDs, and doctoral students for its 26th Annual Planetary 
Science Summer School, which will be held in three separate sessions 
in summer 2014 (June 16-20, July 14-18, and August 11-15) at the 
Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, CA.  

During the program and pre-session webinars, student teams will 
carry out the equivalent of an early mission concept study, prepare 
a proposal authorization review presentation, present it to a review 
board, and receive feedback. By the end of the session, students 
will have a clearer understanding of the life cycle of a space 
mission; relationships between mission design, cost, and schedule; 
and the tradeoffs necessary to stay within cost and schedule while 
preserving the quality of science. The 2014 sessions will address 
planetary exploration missions needing power system trade-offs, 
including the use of solar electric vs. Multi-mission Radioisotope 
Thermoelectric Generators (MMRTG). The session in August will have 
a targeted focus on spacecraft power systems.

Applications are due April 1, 2014. Partial financial support is 
available for a limited number of individuals. Further information 
is available at:
