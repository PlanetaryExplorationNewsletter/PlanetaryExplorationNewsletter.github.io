AGU SESSION PS1871 - RECENT SOLAR SYSTEM DISCOVERIES USING THE DEEP 
SPACE NETWORK

The Deep Space Network is well known for its role in commanding and 
communicating with planetary spacecraft that are producing a steady 
stream of new discoveries. The antennas within the Deep Space Network 
also can be used as science instruments in their own right to 
complement and extend the observations conducted with spacecraft. Using 
radio science techniques that link a spacecraft and ground antenna, the 
atmospheres and interiors of solar system objects ranging from 
asteroids to planets can be probed. Using radar transmissions, surface 
and sub-surface characteristics of asteroids, moons, and planets can 
be probed and orbits determined to high precision. This session invites 
papers that highlight recent discoveries or that illustrate the future 
potential for discoveries on the interiors, surfaces, and 
characteristics of solar system bodies obtained by using the Deep 
Space Network.

Deadline for abstract submission: 6 August 23:59 EDT/03:59 +1 GMT

AGU SESSION PS2464 - ICY WORLD ERUPTIONS AND THEIR ANALOGUES

AGU Fall Meeting in San Francisco, CA, December 15-19, 2014.

The potential existence of large plumes of water emitted from Europa's 
surface has exciting implications for assessing the habitability of 
this icy world. While the evidence from Hubble Space Telescope 
observations presently awaits confirmation, the analogy to active 
plumes at Enceladus motivates discussion of how to detect and 
characterize plumes, and how to understand eruptive features in the 
solar system in general. This session examines the mechanisms for plume 
formation and dispersal; geological signatures of eruptions; inorganic 
and organic composition of materials ejected from the surface and 
subsurface; and implications for habitability and life detection. 
Comparisons with eruptive features and activity on bodies such as 
Ceres, Enceladus, Io, Triton, Venus, and Earth are encouraged.

IMPACT GEOLOGY RESEARCH OPPORTUNITY OF A MASTER OF SCIENCE DEGREE

Presently, there is an opening for a geology student holding a BS in 
geology to enter the Masters (M.S.) in geology program at Auburn 
University’s Department of Geology and Geography and study impact 
geology for his or her thesis research project. Auburn has a small 
impact and planetary geology program, where the emphasis is on marine 
impact craters and impact-related stratigraphy. The candidate must 
have a BS in geology or equivalent degree in hand by January 2015,
must have gained admission to the Graduate School at Auburn, and must 
agree to move to Auburn, Alabama and take up an available teaching 
assistantship and impact-geology research project by the onset of the 
spring semester 2015 (i.e., January 14, 2015). Learn more about 
Auburn at: 

http://www.auburn.edu 

and about the G&G department at: 

http://www.auburn.edu/academic/cosam/departments/geology/index.htm

For more information on this opportunity, please contact Prof. David 
King (kingdat@auburn.edu; 1 334 844 4882).

[NASA] SCHEDULE FOR HAYABUSA 2 PARTICIPATING SCIENTIST PROGRAM

NASA intends to release ROSES-2014 C.19, the call for Participating 
Scientist and Sample Scientist proposals to enhance the scientific 
return from the Hayabusa2 mission in December 2014.
 
The purpose of this call is to broaden participation in the Hayabusa2 
mission, augment the existing science team to include new 
investigations that enhance and/or complement the currently funded 
investigations, and maximize the contribution of the mission to the 
scientific understanding and future exploration of asteroids. Equally 
important this will increase the number of scientists supporting 
mission planning and execution. While a large fraction of the planned 
observations will be planned in advance, real-time response to a 
brand-new set of observations is expected to result in an ongoing 
requirement for significant replanning.
  
The due date for Step-2 proposals will be no less than 90 days after 
the release of the call. NASA anticipates that instrument scientist 
awards from proposals submitted to C.19 will receive funding starting 
in FY 2016 and the Sample Scientist awards starting with a small 
amount in 2017.

NASA POSTDOCTORAL FELLOWSHIPS
 
The NASA Postdoctoral Program (NPP) provides opportunities for 
scientists and engineers to conduct research largely of their own 
choosing, yet compatible with the research opportunities posted on the 
NPP Web site.
 
Selected by a competitive peer-review process, NPP Fellows complete 
one- to three-year Fellowship appointments that advance NASA's 
missions in earth science, heliophysics, planetary science, 
astrophysics, space bioscience, aeronautics and engineering, human 
exploration and space operations, and astrobiology.
 
An example of one of the research opportunities in planetary science 
is:
 
https://www3.orau.gov/NPDoc/Catalog/17585     
 
Applicants must have a Ph.D. or equivalent degree in hand before 
beginning the fellowship, but may apply while completing the degree 
requirements. U. S. citizens, Lawful Permanent Residents, and foreign 
nationals eligible for J-1 status as a Research Scholar may apply.
 
Stipends start at $53,500 per year, with supplements for high cost-of-
living areas and for certain academic specialties. Financial assistance 
is available for relocation and health insurance, and $8,000 per year 
is provided for professional travel.

Applications are accepted three times each year: March 1, July 1, and 
November 1.

LATEST VENUS EXPLORATION DOCUMENTS NOW POSTED ON VEXAG WEBSITE

At the Venus Exploration Analysis Group (VEXAG) meeting in November 
2012, it was resolved to update the scientific priorities and 
strategies for Venus exploration. To achieve this goal, three major 
tasks were defined and resulted in the following three documents:

(1)  Update to the document prioritizing Goals, Objectives, and 
     Investigations for Venus Exploration,

(2)  Develop a Roadmap for Venus Exploration that is consistent with 
     VEXAG priorities as well as Planetary Decadal Survey priorities, 
     and

(3)  Develop a white paper on technologies for Venus missions, a 
     Venus Technology Plan. 

If you haven’t done so already, please visit the VEXAG Website: 

http://www.lpi.usra.edu/vexag/ 

and endorse these 3 documents.
 
In addition, a Venus Exploration Themes document was prepared as an 
adjunct to these three VEXAG documents in order to preserve important 
extracts from previous versions of VEXAG’s Venus Exploration Goals 
and Objectives documents - Venus Exploration Themes.
 
The latest versions of all four of these documents are available now 
at the VEXAG Website:

The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Science
Mission Directorate (SMD) is releasing draft text for an Announcement 
of Opportunity (AO) to solicit Principal Investigator (PI) led space 
science investigations for the Discovery Program. The draft text can 
be downloaded from the NSPIRES web page either by going to: 

https://nspires.nasaprs.com/ 

selecting "Solicitations", then "Open" under the "View Solicitations" 
heading and searching for Discovery 2014 or NNH14ZDA009J. Comments on 
this draft text are due to the point of contact below by July 16, 
2014. It is anticipated that Step-1 proposals will be due late in 
calendar year 2014.
 
The goal of NASA’s Discovery Program is to provide frequent flight 
opportunities for high quality, high value, focused, planetary science 
investigations that can be accomplished under a not to exceed cost cap.
 
The AO Cost Cap for a Discovery mission is $450M in Fiscal Year (FY) 
2015 dollars, not including the cost of the Expendable Launch Vehicle 
(ELV) or any contributions. Any selected mission will launch no later 
than December 31, 2021.

ESO WORKSHOP - GROUND AND SPACE OBSERVATORIES: A JOINT VENTURE TO 
PLANETARY SCIENCE

We are pleased to announce that registration will soon open for an ESO 
workshop on "Ground and Space Observatories: A Joint Venture to 
Planetary Science" to be held March 2-5, 2015 in Santiago, Chile. For
more information, please see:

http://www.eso.org/sci/meetings/2015/Planets2015.html

The goal of this workshop is to explore synergies between ground and 
space-based observatories with planetary missions for exploring the 
Solar System and planets, and to foster collaborations between the 
different communities by sharing scientific and technical knowledge, 
needs, requirements, and techniques. Scientific topics include, e.g., 
planetary atmospheres, surfaces and rings, moons, asteroids, TNOs and 
comets.
