[NASA] PLANETARY SCIENCE DIVISION PEER REVIEW OPPORTUNITIES

The Planetary Science Division has recently posted some more 
opportunities to volunteer to serve as a peer reviewer at:

http://science.nasa.gov/researchers/volunteer-review-panels/ 

including:

ROSES 2014 C.3 Solar System Workings
ROSES 2014 C.7 Planetary Data Archiving, Restoration, and Tools
ROSES 2014 C.9 The Mars Data Analysis Program
ROSES 2014 C.10 Cassini Data Analysis and Participating Scientist 
                Program
ROSES 2014 C.11 Discovery Data Analysis
ROSES 2014 C.14 Planetary Science and Technology Through Analog 
                Research

This is a very good opportunity for any planetary scientist who wants 
to improve their proposal writing skills and is especially useful to 
early career scientists. If you fill out the volunteer reviewer form 
for a program and you also are or plan to be a team member on a 
proposal to that program then please describe this in the 
"Comment box:"

WOMEN IN PLANETARY SCIENCE LUNCH AT DPS
 
Join us for an informal meeting and discussion hour over lunch on 
Tuesday, November 11th 2014, from 12:00-1:30. This year's topics will 
revolve around the ideas of powerful communication and how to be an 
ally to minority community members. We will have presentation material 
interspersed with plenty of discussion time. Please feel free to bring 
any information/announcements related to women in astronomy and 
planetary science to share. 
 
Thanks to the generosity of the DPS committee, we will be able to 
provide lunch this year. All are welcome(!), but pre-registration at:

http://bit.ly/DPS_WIPS_2014 

is required due to space limitations. Please register before 
October 15th so we can accurately place the lunch order.

[NASA] PDS - LRO RELEASE 19

The NASA Planetary Data System is pleased to announce a new delivery 
of Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) data for the following 
instruments: 

CRaTER
DLRE
LAMP
LEND
LOLA
LROC

In general, LRO Release 19 includes data collected between 
March 15, 2014 and June 14, 2014. To access the above data, 
please visit the following link:

http://pds.nasa.gov/subscription_service/SS-20140915.html

PDS offers two services for searching the LRO archives:
The Planetary Image Atlas at the Imaging Node allows selection of 
LRO data by specific search criteria.   

http://pds-imaging.jpl.nasa.gov/search/lro/

The Lunar Orbital Data Explorer at the Geosciences Node allows 
searching and downloading of LRO data and other lunar orbital data 
sets (Clementine and Lunar Prospector).

[NASA] PDS - NMS, UVS AND LADEE DATA RELEASE

The NASA Planetary Data System announces the release of certified 
Neutral Mass Spectrometer (NMS) and Ultraviolet Visible Spectrometer 
(UVS) observations from the Lunar Atmosphere & Dust Environment 
Explorer (LADEE) mission, covering data from both the primary 
and extended missions. To access the data, please visit the PDS 
Atmospheric Discipline Node website:

http://atmos.nmsu.edu/ 

or directly go to:

NASA POSTDOCTORAL FELLOWSHIPS

The NASA Postdoctoral Program (NPP) provides opportunities for 
scientists and engineers to conduct research largely of their own 
choosing, yet compatible with the research opportunities posted on 
the NPP Web site.

Selected by a competitive peer-review process, NPP Fellows complete 
one- to three-year Fellowship appointments that advance NASA's 
missions in earth science, heliophysics, planetary science, 
astrophysics, space bioscience, aeronautics and engineering, human 
exploration and space operations, and astrobiology.

A sample research opportunity is: 

https://www3.orau.gov/NPDoc/Catalog/18709

Applicants must have a Ph.D. or equivalent degree in hand before 
beginning the fellowship, but may apply while completing the degree 
requirements. U. S. citizens, Lawful Permanent Residents, and foreign 
nationals eligible for J-1 status as a Research Scholar may apply.

Stipends start at $53,500 per year, with supplements for high cost-
of-living areas and for certain academic specialties. Financial 
assistance is available for relocation and health insurance, and 
$8,000 per year is provided for professional travel.

Applications are accepted three times each year: March 1, July 1, 
and November 1.

WORKSHOP: THE HITCHHIKER'S GUIDE TO THE HERSCHEL SCIENCE ARCHIVE

Herschel Space Observatory: An ESA Mission with Participation from NASA 

Join us for The Hitchhiker's Guide to Extracting SEDs and Spectra from 
the Herschel Science Archive, a workshop to be held October 6-10, 2014, 
on the Caltech campus in Pasadena, CA. The workshop features a 
Herschel Essentials track (mornings only) on manipulating and 
extracting science results from processed products in the Herschel 
Science Archive, and a Master track (entire workshop) for those wanting 
the details of how to reprocess the data.

Each day will include hands-on sessions guided by our expert 
instrument scientists. We can provide virtual machines to those who 
need them with software and data pre-installed, to enable participants 
to quickly get experience with Herschel products. 

Please register by September 30th. Visit our workshop website for 
more details:

FACULTY OPENING - WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY IN ST. LOUIS

The Department of Physics at Washington University in St. Louis 
invites applications to fill a tenure-track faculty opening in 
Experimental Space Physics. We are primarily looking for a candidate 
who will interact with a vibrant research group that uses 
microanalysis of extraterrestrial materials to provide insights 
into nucleosynthesis, formation and processing of dust in a variety 
of astrophysical settings, and the origin/evolution of the solar 
system. However, we will also consider scientists whose research falls 
broadly in the area of space-physics/astrophysics, and will add 
significantly to or complement the research being carried out in the 
Physics Department:

http://www.physics.wustl.edu

and the research in adjoining Department of Earth & Planetary Sciences:

http://www.eps.wustl.edu

which is conducting a parallel search in geochemistry. The appointment 
will begin Fall 2015 and includes membership in the McDonnell Center 
for the Space Sciences, a world-class intellectual cluster in the 
field of space sciences (MCSS.wustl.edu). Candidates are sought for 
the rank of Assistant Professor, although applications from well-
qualified senior candidates will be considered at the appropriate 
advanced level. For complete details on application requirements see:

SPECIAL REGIONS SAG FINAL REPORT AVAILABLE ON MEPAG WEBSITE

MEPAG community,

Eleven months ago MEPAG chartered a Science Analysis Group to update 
our understandings of Planetary Protection "Special Regions" on Mars.  
These are places on Mars (in 3-D) where terrestrial organisms are 
likely to replicate. The last MEPAG SAG to visit this topic (SR-SAG1) 
was in 2006. For the SR-SAG2, we assigned this challenging job to a 
relatively large team with a mixture of expertise in Mars environmental 
conditions and in the limits to life as we know them on Earth. This 
committee has delivered periodic progress reports in the interim, 
including a major PPT presentation at our May MEPAG meeting and a 
presentation to COSPAR in August. I am now pleased to report that the 
committee has delivered their final report, I have accepted it, and 
it has been posted on the MEPAG web site at:

http://mepag.nasa.gov/reports.cfm?expand=topical

The committee additionally proposed that this document be offered to 
the journal Astrobiology to improve the report's distribution, 
visibility, and compactness/readability, and I have endorsed this 
strategy, now in progress.

- Professor Lisa Pratt, MEPAG Chair
