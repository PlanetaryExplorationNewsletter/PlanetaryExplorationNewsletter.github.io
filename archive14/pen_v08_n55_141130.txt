2015 PIERAZZO INTERNATIONAL STUDENT TRAVEL AWARD

Application deadline: December 15, 2014

Awards will be announced on or about December 31, 2014

This award is established by the Planetary Science Institute in memory 
of Senior Scientist Betty Pierazzo to support and encourage graduate 
students to build international collaborations and relationships in 
planetary science. Two awards will be made each year, contingent upon 
there being meritorious applications. One will be awarded to a graduate 
student working on his or her Ph.D. at an institution within the U.S. 
This is to support travel to a planetary science related meeting 
(conferences and workshops) outside of the U.S. The second award will 
be to a graduate student working on his or her Ph.D. at an institution 
outside of the U.S. This is to support travel to a planetary science 
related meeting within the U.S. These include general meetings that 
have planetary-focused sessions such as the AGU, GSA, EGU and IAG.

The award will consist of a certificate and up to $2000US.

PAST LIFE? PRESENT LIFE? THE FUTURE OF SOLAR SYSTEM EXPLORATION

The Planetary Society cordially invites you to attend our special 
event, "Past Life? Present Life? The Future of Solar System 
Exploration" at 2 p.m. on Tuesday, December 2nd, in Dirksen 562.

Confirmed guests for this event are:

* Bill Nye, CEO of The Planetary Society
* Dr. Kevin Hand, Deputy Chief Scientist of Solar System Exploration, 
  Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL)
* Dr. Michael Meyer, Lead Scientist for the Mars Exploration 
  Program, NASA

As the stunning success of ESA's Philae lander has again demonstrated, 
people around the world embrace the bold exploration of our solar 
system. In this engaging event, we will highlight the astrobiological 
possibilities of two of the most compelling solar system 
destinations - Mars and Europa - and see how NASA can (and will) lead 
the way in the future exploration of both. We will ensure a significant 
amount of Q&A time to explore some of the issues surrounding the 
possibilities in planetary exploration, and also what NASA at its 
partners are doing right now.

We hope you can join us at this free, public event.

You can optionally RSVP at:

NASA POSTDOCTORAL FELLOWSHIPS

The NASA Postdoctoral Program (NPP) provides opportunities for 
scientists and engineers to conduct research largely of their own 
choosing, yet compatible with the research opportunities posted on 
the NPP Web site.

Selected by a competitive peer-review process, NPP Fellows complete 
one- to three-year Fellowship appointments that advance NASA's missions 
in earth science, heliophysics, planetary science, astrophysics, space 
bioscience, aeronautics and engineering, human exploration and space 
operations, and astrobiology.

A sample research opportunity is:

https://www3.orau.gov/NPDoc/Catalog/18624

Applicants must have a Ph.D. or equivalent degree in hand before 
beginning the fellowship, but may apply while completing the degree 
requirements. U. S. citizens, Lawful Permanent Residents, and foreign 
nationals eligible for J-1 status as a Research Scholar may apply.

Stipends start at $53,500 per year, with supplements for high cost-
of-living areas and for certain academic specialties. Financial 
assistance is available for relocation and health insurance, and 
$8,000 per year is provided for professional travel.

Applications are accepted three times each year: March 1, July 1, 
and November 1.
