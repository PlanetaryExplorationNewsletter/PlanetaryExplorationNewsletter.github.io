GSA SESSION T229 - THE HOLEY SOLAR SYSTEM

We want to draw your attention to this session at the GSA Annual 
Meeting on impact cratering. Please consider submitting an abstract!
Deadline is July 29, 2014. 

This session focuses on the nature of impact craters and processes. 
Terrestrial craters provide ground-truth for the remote sensing 
interpretation of planetary craters. We solicit contributions 
regarding shock processes, materials, modeling, geologic structure, 
impactor evolution, and airburst phenomena are solicited. Comparisons 
of cratering among different size bodies are encouraged.

Data from terrestrial field work, advances in modeling and 
experimentation, spacecraft data have provided significant new insight 
into the characteristics of the impact cratering processes. This 
session will provide an opportunity to share information and insight.

GSA SESSION T231 - ICE THROUGHOUT THE SOLAR SYSTEM

We call your attention to a special session on Ice Throughout the 
Solar System, for the Geological Society of America Meeting, to be 
held Oct. 19 - 22 in Vancouver. The abstract deadline is Tuesday, 
July 29. For more information, see: 

http://community.geosociety.org/gsa2014/science/sessions 

Ice is ubiquitous throughout the solar system: it has been found in 
unexpected places, may be preserved for billions of years, and can 
behave like rock at outer solar system temperatures. We propose an 
interdisciplinary session on the science of ice in any form (not just 
water ice), on Earth or in any part of the solar system, including 
laboratory analyses, terrestrial field work, geomorphology, and 
planetary and telescopic data analysis. Submissions may include, but 
are not limited to, research into terrestrial permafrost and Arctic 
and Antarctic ice sheets, the Martian permafrost and polar caps, ice 
within the permanently shadowed regions of Mercury and the Moon, ice 
in planetary rings and plumes, outer solar system bodies including 
Europa, Enceladus, Triton, Titan and Pluto, and small bodies 
including comets and ice-rich asteroids such as Ceres.

AGU SESSION B3387 - LOOKING FOR LIFE: FORMATION, PRESERVATION AND 
DETECTION OF BIOSIGNATURES IN TERRESTRIAL ANALOGUE ENVIRONMENTS

Interpreting in situ enigmatic features (body or trace fossils, 
isotopic or molecular signatures, chemical disequilibria, or 
conspicuous mineralization) as indicators of biological activity is a 
notoriously difficult task. The goal of characterizing biosignatures 
is not only to identify attributes as uniquely produced by biological 
processes, but also to recognize these attributes as unambiguous 
indicators of life. Understanding and recognizing the biogeochemical 
process that result in biosignatures, both in the lab and in field-
based studies of terrestrial analogues of potentially habitable 
environments beyond Earth, will provide valuable information for 
future life detection missions. Emphasis will be placed on 
interdisciplinary studies that advance our understanding of 
biosignature formation mechanisms and detection methods.

AGU SESSION P1671 - THE SCIENCE OF EXPLORATION AS ENABLED BY THE MOON, 
NEAR EARTH ASTEROIDS AND THE MOONS OF MARS

A close collaboration between science, technology and exploration will 
enable deeper understanding of the Moon and other airless bodies as we 
move further out of low-Earth orbit. The new Solar System Exploration 
Research Virtual Institute (SSERVI) will focus on the scientific 
aspects of exploration as they pertain to the Moon, Near Earth 
Asteroids (NEAs) and the moons of Mars. This session will feature 
interdisciplinary, exploration-related science centered around all 
airless bodies targeted as potential human destinations. Areas of 
study reported here will represent the broad spectrum of lunar, NEA, 
and Martian moon sciences encompassing investigations of the surface, 
interior, exosphere, and near-space environments as well as science 
uniquely enabled from these bodies.

Please join the SSERVI planetary and exploration science community 
by submitting an abstract to this AGU session.

AGU SESSION P2116 - MERCURY: RESULTS FROM MESSENGER'S LOW-ALTITUDE
CAMPAIGN

We invite contributions to a special session on Mercury at the 2014 
AGU Fall Meeting in San Francisco, CA, December 15–19, 2014.

NASA's MESSENGER mission, now nearing the fourth and final year of 
orbital operations at Mercury, is well into a low-altitude campaign 
that is returning images and measurements of the planetary surface 
and near-surface that are unprecedented in their resolution. This 
session will highlight the latest results from MESSENGER observations 
and their implications for Mercury's geological evolution, the 
interaction of the planet's exosphere and magnetosphere with the 
solar wind and interplanetary magnetic field, and the planet's 
geophysical and geochemical characteristics. We also welcome 
contributed papers on future mission opportunities, complementary 
ground-based observations, laboratory measurements, and theoretical 
developments relevant to planetary processes at Mercury.

Invited Speakers:

AGU SESSION P2314 - PLANETARY MAGNETIC FIELDS, INTERIOR DYNAMICS, AND 
MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES

Abstract submission deadline: August 6, 2014

Planetary magnetic fields open a window to a planet's interior and may 
also play a role in the retention of a planet's atmosphere from the 
effects of stellar wind, providing an opportunity for life to exist 
and flourish at the surface of terrestrial planets. This session 
invites papers regarding theories, numerical simulations, and 
observations of the nature of magnetic fields in solar system planets 
or extrasolar planets.  Further, the session aims to bring together 
scientists from different communities for an up-to-date overview of 
the nature of planetary magnetic fields and interior dynamics in the 
Solar system planets and exoplanets.  Contributions dealing with 
magnetic field generation and Solar wind interaction with planetary 
magnetic fields are welcome. Observational methods of interest are 
low frequency radio, UV, and other remote sensing techniques that may 
provide evidence for the presence of extrasolar planetary magnetic 
fields.

AGU SESSION P3235 - TITAN'S ENIGMATIC ATMOSPHERE AND IONOSPHERE

Abstract submission deadline: August 6th

The processes that control Titan’s atmosphere and ionosphere remain in 
many ways enigmatic even after ten years of observations and study 
from the Cassini mission and the Huygens probe. The instruments 
onboard Cassini-Huygens have studied in-situ and remotely many aspects 
of Titan’s atmosphere and coupled ionosphere. In the mesosphere, 
stratosphere, thermosphere, ionosphere, and exosphere studies of 
atmospheric composition, structure, and chemistry have recently 
produced breakthroughs in our understanding of this complex system. 
In this session, we focus on recent and ongoing studies of Titan’s 
atmosphere and ionosphere. Papers focusing on atmospheric observations, 
modeling, and laboratory studies are welcomed.

AGU SESSION P3480 - SURFACE BOUNDARY EXOSPHERES: COMPARING THE MOON, 
MERCURY, AND MUCH MORE

Surface boundary exospheres are thin collisionless planetary 
atmospheres in which gas and dust constituents only collide with the 
surface.  This class of atmosphere may be the most common among solar 
system objects. Mercury, the Moon, several outer planets moons, and 
Saturn’s rings are known to host such atmospheres, and it is likely 
that other moons and the larger asteroids do also, including trojans 
and centaurs. These bodies should also host tenuous shrouds of dust, 
whether from actively vented plume materials or ejecta from ongoing 
micrometeoroid bombardment of the surfaces and ring systems of such 
bodies. The purpose of this session is to report results from recent 
missions, including MESSENGER at Mercury, LADEE and LRO at the Moon, 
Cassini at Saturn/Enceladus, Hubble and Galileo at Europa and Io, and 
Earth-based occultations of Chariklo. Comparison of observations 
with modeling results of source, transport and loss processes are 
very welcome.

AGU SESSION P3609 - ALTERATION AND SECONDARY PHASES ON MARS: INDICATORS 
OF HABITABLE ENVIRONMENTS

This session will focus on understanding the range of habitable 
environments available on Mars in both the past and present using the 
geochemical record. It has long been appreciated that many martian 
surface materials have interacted with or formed in water; the nature 
of these materials can elucidate the aqueous conditions under which 
they formed. New datasets from surface and orbital missions have 
expanded the range of known habitable environments on Mars by 
revealing novel alteration pathways and secondary mineral phases in a 
variety of forms (including clays, cements, and coatings). Studies 
integrating in situ, remote sensing, laboratory, and terrestrial 
analog datasets are encouraged.

ASTEROID IMPACT DEFLECTION ASSESSMENT (AIDA) WORKSHOP 

The first International Asteroid Impact Deflection Assessment (AIDA) 
Workshop will be held 15-17 October 2014 in Laurel, Maryland. AIDA is 
a technology demonstration of the kinetic impactor concept. It is 
composed of the DART (Double Asteroid Redirection Test) and AIM 
(Asteroid Impact Mission) spacecrafts, each under consideration by 
NASA and ESA.The combination of both spacecrafts is referred to as 
AIDA.

Abstracts are solicited for participants to the workshop. Topics 
include studies relevant to the two concepts (DART projectile and AIM 
rendezvous spacecraft), knowledge of the Didymos binary system (the 
target of the AIDA demonstration), and on binary origins, dynamics 
and properties (e.g. regolith and surface characteristics, internal 
structure), impact observing strategies, additional science 
opportunities during an impact demonstration and associated payloads, 
impact modeling and momentum transfer of an artificial projectile, 
ejecta dynamics, etc.

[NASA] HELIOPHYSICS TECHNOLOGY AND INSTRUMENT DEVELOPMENT FOR SCIENCE

The Heliophysics Technology and Instrument Development for Science 
(H-TIDeS) program seeks to investigate key Heliophysics science 
questions by addressing the best possible: 

(i) science and/or 
technology investigations that can be carried out with instruments 
flown on suborbital sounding rockets, stratospheric balloons, CubeSats, 
commercial reusable suborbital launch vehicles, or other platforms; 

(ii) state-of-the-art instrument technology development for instruments 
that may be proposed as candidate experiments for future space flight 
opportunities; and 

(iii) laboratory research. CubeSat proposals must be 
responsive to the Exploration Mission 1 (EM-1) opportunity. PI's of 
Step-2 proposals must have previously submitted a Step-1 proposal.
 
This amendment delays the Step-2 due date for Heliophysics Technology 
and Instrument Development for Science (H-TIDeS) to September 5, 2014, 
because of the change in program management for the program.
