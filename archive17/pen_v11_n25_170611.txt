PUBLIC LIBRARIES DISTRIBUTING TWO MILLION ECLIPSE-VIEWING GLASSES

More than two million pairs of eclipse glasses are being distributed
free through public libraries for the eclipse of the Sun taking place
on August 21, 2017. About 4,500 public libraries have received a
package of free safe-viewing glasses, plus a 24-page information
booklet on how best to do public outreach about the eclipse.

The project is supported by the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation, with
additional help from Google. The project was conceived by three
astronomers, Andrew Fraknoi (Foothill College), Dennis Schatz (Pacific
Science Center), and Douglas Duncan (University of Colorado.) They
brought the idea to Paul Dusenbery at the Space Science Institute,
which has the STARNet network of libraries:

http://www.starnetlibraries.org/2017eclipse/   

You can see an interactive map of participating libraries at that site.
The eclipse information booklet, with clear non-technical background
information, safe observing techniques, and suggestions for how
libraries can find outreach helpers, can be downloaded free by anyone
at:

http://www.starnetlibraries.org/EclipseGuide/ 

Astronomers, astronomy hobbyists, and science teachers are needed to
partner with libraries in their own communities, helping to put on
eclipse outreach events in the weeks before the eclipse. Please
contact your library and volunteer.

NOI DEADLINE REMINDER MAPPING OF WATER DEPOSITS TO SUPPORT MARS
EXPLORATION PROGRAM

Please be advised that Notices of Intent (NOIs) for the Request for
Proposals (RFP) entitled Mapping of Water Deposits to Support Mars
Exploration Program Studies are due on June 15, 2017 at 3:00pm PDT.
Please note that NOIs are optional, but highly encouraged.

This RFP was released by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in support of
NASA's Mars Exploration Program, and seeks two data products focused 
on mapping water on Mars. These are: (1) A map of the distribution 
and concentration of subsurface water ice within a predefined swath
extending from low to high latitudes; and (2) A global map cataloging
all known surface hydrated mineral deposits and its characteristics.
These products will be used to support NASA's Mars Human Landing 
Sites Study (HLS2) and other future landing site selection processes.

Details of the RFP are available at:

https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/acquisition/opportunities/rfp/km-2691-947266/

The full proposal deadline is June 30, 2017 3pm PT.

NOI submissions and questions related to the RFP may be addressed to
Kathryn Manzanares, Subcontracts Manager, NASA Jet Propulsion
Laboratory; Tel.: (818) 393-5983; kathryn.manzanares@jpl.nasa.gov.

GSA 2017 SESSION T.207 VOLCANISM AND TECTONISM ACROSS THE SOLAR SYSTEM

We invite you to submit an abstract to our planetary volcanism and
tectonism session at this year's GSA Annual Meeting in Seattle, WA 
on October 22-25, 2017.

Our session solicits abstracts on volcanic, tectonic, or
volcanotectonic landforms and processes on the gamut of Solar System
bodies, and encompasses surface geology, interior and thermal
evolution, and comparative planetary studies with observational,
experimental, or theoretical approaches.

Please submit your abstract here: 

https://gsa.confex.com/gsa/2017AM/top/papers/index.cgi?sessionid=42684

The submission deadline is August 1, 2017.

Conveners:
Paul K. Byrne (NCSU)
Christian Klimczak (UGA)

We look forward to seeing you in Seattle!
