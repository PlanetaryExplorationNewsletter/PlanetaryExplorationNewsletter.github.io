[NASA] MARS RECONNAISSANCE ORBITER CRISM TER AND MTRDR RELEASE 7

PDS announces Release 7 of Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter CRISM Targeted
Empirical Data Record (TER) and Map-projected Targeted Reduced Data
Record (MTRDR) products, at

http://pds-geosciences.wustl.edu/missions/mro/crism.htm

This release fills in data from September 30, 2006, to May 21, 2012. 
TER products are image cubes derived from CRISM hyperspectral targeted
observations, post-processed to standardize the illumination and
observation geometry and remove atmospheric gas absorptions and
instrument artifacts. MTRDRs are the same products map-projected using
terrain models of the Martian surface.

[NASA] ROSES-17 AMENDMENT 28: JUNO PSP DRAFT TEXT FOR COMMUNITY COMMENT
 
The objective of the Juno Participating Scientist Program (Juno PSP)
will be to enhance the scientific return during the science phase of
the Juno mission by expanding participation in the mission through new
investigations that broaden and/or complement existing mission
investigations. The Principal Investigator (PI) of a selected proposal,
and that person alone, will be added to the Juno Science Team as a
Participating Scientist and will be given all of the rights and
responsibilities of Juno Co-Is, as per the Juno Rules of the Road.

The Juno Participating Scientist Program is jointly solicited by the
NASA Planetary Science and Heliophysics Divisions, but will be
administered primarily by the Planetary Science Division. As such, this
program element is governed by information contained in Appendix C.1,
Planetary Science Research Overview, except where superseded by the
program element.

https://science.nasa.gov/researchers/sara/grant-solicitations/roses-
2017/

All questions or comments on this draft program element should be
emailed to jared.s.leisner@nasa.gov by September 29, 2017.

DPS PROFESSIONAL CULTURE AND CLIMATE SUBCOMMITTEE (PCCS)

The DPS Professional Culture and Climate Subcommittee (PCCS) is
currently soliciting nominations (including self-nominations) for
membership for a two-year term. The purpose of the PCCS is to work
towards making the community of planetary scientists an environment in
which professional merit is the only criterion that determines each
person's success. The detailed charge of the PCCS, along with a list
of current members, is available on the DPS web site:

https://dps.aas.org/leadership/climate

The PCCS is seeking new members who are interested in working on issues
that promote a broadly inclusive professional planetary science
community. Members are expected to participate in bi-monthly telecons,
along with completing individual or group tasks between our regularly
scheduled calls. Any active DPS member who is interested in
participating in the PCCS should send an expression of interest
containing a 2-3 sentence biographical sketch and a 2-3 sentence
description of why you wish you serve on PCCS, including a description
of any prior experience you may have in working on diversity and
inclusion-related issues.

Expressions of interest should be sent to the PCCS Incoming Chair,
Julie Rathbun, at rathbun@psi.edu

access the above data, please visit the following link:
 
http://pds.nasa.gov/tools/subscription_service/SS-20170915.shtml

PDS offers two services for searching the LRO archives. The Planetary
Image Atlas at the Imaging Node allows selection of LRO data by
specific search criteria:

http://pds-imaging.jpl.nasa.gov/search/lro/

The Lunar Orbital Data Explorer at the Geosciences Node allows
searching and downloading of LRO data and other lunar orbital data sets
(Clementine and Lunar Prospector).
