[NASA] ROSES-17 AMENDMENT 23: LDAP DUE DATES DELAYED

The Lunar Data Analysis Program (LDAP) program funds research on the
analysis of recent lunar missions in order to enhance their scientific
return. LDAP broadens scientific participation in the analysis of
mission data sets and funds high-priority areas of research that
support planning for future lunar missions.
 
Required Step-1 proposals are now due November 30, 2017. Step-2 
proposals are due March 1, 2018. The purpose of this delay is to help 
de-cluster the PSD R&A due dates and to provide a more even 
distribution of R&A due dates throughout the year.
 
For information about LDAP, go to:

2017/

may be reached at rfogel@nasa.gov.

[NASA] ROSES-17 AMENDMENT 24: K2GO6 FINAL TEXT
 
D.7 K2 Guest Observer - Cycle 6 (K2GO) solicits proposals for the 
acquisition and analysis of new scientific data from the K2 mission.
The submission and target selection process has been changed.

K2 repurposes the space-borne hardware and ground-based operations of
the Kepler mission for a pointed survey of predetermined locations
along the ecliptic plane. The fields covered by the observing campaigns
under Cycle 6 are described at: 

https://keplerscience.arc.nasa.gov/k2-fields.html.
 
K2GO6 will use a new two-phase submission and target selection process,
since spacecraft fuel is estimated to run out during observations. An
optional Phase-1 proposal, for campaigns 17-19 combined, will enable
targets to be selected ahead of the observing campaigns. Phase-1
proposals, including target lists and a scientific rationale (submitted
to keplergo@mail.arc.nasa.gov) are requested by October 12, 2017. If
the spacecraft health and fuel allow, then Phase-2 proposals will be
due April 19, 2018. Phase-2 proposals are limited to use observations
for targets selected as part of Phase-1 published in February 2018 at:

https://keplerscience.arc.nasa.gov.
 
Technical and implementation questions should be directed to: Geert
Barentsen (geert.barentsen@nasa.gov).

Perez (mario.perez@nasa.gov).

GLOBAL REFERENCE ATMOSPHERIC MODEL (GRAM) VIRTUAL WORKSHOP
 
September 21, 2017
  
The Global Reference Atmospheric Model (GRAM) Virtual Workshop will be
held via WebEx on Thursday, September 21, 2017.
 
The purpose of this workshop is for GRAM developers, GRAM users,
planetary atmospheric modelers, and other interested parties to discuss
the future of the GRAMs. This workshop will include Earth, Mars, Venus,
Neptune and Titan-GRAM. The workshop objective will be to identify and
prioritize GRAM development work. 
 
The workshop will highlight recent GRAM usage as well as the importance
of GRAMs as a critical tool set. Presentations about each GRAM will be
given by the GRAM team. These presentations will detail their current
status, near-term update plans, and ideas for new capabilities.

Discussion topics will include:

Modeling and User Community Inputs Regarding Current GRAMs
Prospective Planetary GRAMs
Capabilities, Upgrades and Long Term Planning
User Community Needs and How GRAM Developers Can Meet These Needs
 
Meeting RSVP: All participants planning to attend the virtual workshop
are asked to RSVP by Friday, September 15, 2017 via email to Hilary
Justh (Hilary.L.Justh@nasa.gov). Please include your name, affiliation,
and contact information when responding.

JWST PROPOSAL WORKSHOPS: REGISTRATION NOW OPEN

Two 2.5 day workshops will be held this Fall for those interested in
proposing solar system observations with the James Webb Space
Telescope(JWST). The first (Nov. 13-15, 2017) will be at the Space
Telescope Science Institute (STScI), in Baltimore Maryland. The second
(Dec. 13-15, 2017) will be held at the European Space Research
Technology Center (ESTEC), in Noordwijk, the Netherlands.

Each workshop will include a mixture of presentations about the promise
of JWST for solar system science, specifics on observer planning tools
and observatory capabilities, and hands-on training and Q&A with the
planning tools. Observations of solar system targets approved for
guaranteed-time observers (GTOs) and through the Early Release Science
(ERS) program will be summarized. The workshop is timed to support JWST
cycle-1 open time proposals, which will be due early March 2018. 

Registration and abstract submission is now open for both events.
Please also feel free to sign up to the mailing list for further
details.
