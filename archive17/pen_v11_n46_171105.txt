2ND COSPAR WORKSHOP ON REFINING THE PLANETARY PROTECTION REQUIREMENTS
FOR HUMAN MISSIONS

COSPAR, with support from ESA and NASA, is pleased to announce the 2nd
COSPAR workshop on refining the planetary protection requirements for
human missions, "Closing Planetary Protection Knowledge Gaps for Future
Human Missions", to be held February 27-28, 2018, at the Lunar and
Planetary Institute in Houston. This workshop is an interdisciplinary
meeting seeking to align previously identified knowledge gaps in
planetary protection with mission opportunities in the timeframe
between now and the first crewed flight to the martian surface. This
workshop will feed into subsequent working meetings that produce COSPAR
reports assessing potential opportunities to address knowledge gaps in
the areas of:

i) Microbial and human health monitoring 
ii) Technology and operations for contamination control
iii) Natural transport of contamination on Mars. 

Further information on agenda, logistics, registration and
opportunities for remote participation, will be available shortly. The
workshop seeks to ensure a balance of discipline specialty and
nationality among the participants. Accordingly, in person attendance
may be limited by the capacity of the facilities. Initial indications
of interest in participation can be sent to james.a.spry@nasa.gov.

ELS LETTER OF INTENT TO PARTICIPATE

We are pleased to announce that the 6th European Lunar Symposium (ELS)
will be held in Toulouse, France May 13-16, 2018. This meeting,
organized in partnership with NASA's Solar System Exploration Research
Virtual Institute (SSERVI), will cover current advances and prospects
in lunar science and exploration in Europe and elsewhere.

Building upon successful previous ELS meetings and acknowledging a
growing interest in lunar science exploration worldwide, we anticipate
a larger number of participants for ELS 2018. In order to make
necessary logistical arrangements, we would like your help (before
abstract submission and registration dates are announced) in letting us
know before December 1st 2017 about your firm intention to attend ELS
2018.

Please visit the following link to submit your response - European
Lunar Symposium (ELS) - 2018 Letter of Intent to Participate

GEOPHYSICAL PLANET DEFINITION (GPD) USERS PAGE

The Geophysical Planet Definition (or GPD) can be stated as "A planet
is a sub-stellar mass body that has never undergone nuclear fusion and
that has enough gravitation to be round due to hydrostatic equilibrium
regardless of its orbital parameters."

We are sampling community usage in GPD. Specifically, we want to know
if you as a planetary scientist think that the GPD is a useful planet
definition (recognizing that other planet definition may also be useful
to you). To that end we've developed a form at:

http://bit.ly/GPD_list

for those who find GPD a handy definition and who want to help us gauge
that interest.

This multi-disciplinary workshop will cover wide range of topics
related to the formation, structure and dynamics of the Solar System
bodies. The workshop is aimed for students (PhD students, but advanced
undergraduate and Master's students are also welcome) and young
researchers of various backgrounds and different levels of experience

RESEARCH ASSOCIATE IN PLANETARY ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCE, UNIVERSITY OF
LEICESTER

Full Details: https://goo.gl/UTxqvx  
Salary Grade 7 - 33,518 to 38,833 pounds per annum, available for 3
years
Closing date: 23 November 2017

The Physics and Astronomy Department at the University of Leicester
invites applications for a Post-Doctoral Research Associate (PDRA) in
Planetary Atmospheric Science. You will join a planetary science team
funded by the European Research Council (ERC), specialising in the
application of radiative transfer and spectral inversion to explore
atmospheric processes on the giant planets of our Solar System. You
will analyse subsets of existing observations from world-leading
ground- and space-based facilities (e.g., Cassini, Spitzer, VLT) to
prepare data analysis procedures for upcoming observations from the
James Webb Space Telescope, due for launch in 2019. This will develop
the expertise and tools required for the first publications exploiting
JWST infrared maps of these distant worlds.

The ERC "GIANTCLIMES" project seeks to investigate the natural cycles
of meteorology, circulation, and chemistry shaping the environments on
the four giant planets. Inversions of planetary spectra will be used to
reconstruct these atmospheres in three dimensions to explore their
spatial and temporal variability. See:

REMINDER: LUNAR SCIENCE FOR LANDED MISSIONS WORKSHOP

SSERVI and LEAG, in partnership, are pleased to announce the "Lunar
Science for Landed Missions Workshop," January 10-12, 2018, at NASA
Ames Research Center. This workshop is intended to produce a set of
priority targets for near-term landed missions on the Moon, primarily,
but not exclusively, from commercial exploration firms interested in
pursuing ventures on the Moon. Abstracts are solicited describing
target areas on the Moon for near-term in-situ science, network
science, and sample return missions. Abstracts should be up to one page
in length and are intended to stimulate discussion about specific
targets. This workshop will result in a report to be presented to NASA
Headquarters as an initial community consensus of priority landed
targets, with the potential of future solicitations for science-focused
payloads at such target sites.

Further information on this workshop, along with information on
logistics, abstract guidelines and submission, and workshop
registration, is available at: 

https://lunar-landing.arc.nasa.gov

Abstracts are due on November 10, 2017.

[NASA] ROSES-17 AMENDMENT 44: C.23 ECF NOT SOLICITED THIS YEAR

The Early Career Fellowship (ECF) program supports the development of
individual research programs of outstanding scientists early in their
careers and stimulates research careers in the areas supported by the
Planetary Sciences Division. This program consists of two components
with two different submission procedures: the first is an application
to be an "Early Career Fellow" and the second is the subsequent
submission of a seven-page proposal for start-up funds by an individual
previously named a fellow. It is the first component of the ECF
program, the application to be an "Early Career Fellow" via program
element C.23, that will not be solicited this year. The Planetary
Science Division anticipates that it will be included in ROSES-2018.

On or about November 3, 2017, this Amendment to the NASA Research
Announcement "Research Opportunities in Space and Earth Sciences
(ROSES) 2017" (NNH17ZDA001N) will be posted on the NASA research
opportunity homepage at:

http://nspires.nasaprs.com/

and will appear on the RSS feed at:

https://science.nasa.gov/researchers/sara/grant-solicitations/roses-
2017/

Questions concerning this program element may be directed to Mary
Voytek at mvoytek@hq.nasa.gov.

ROSES-17 AMENDMENT 45: D.13 SOFIA NEXT GENERATION INSTRUMENT DRAFT TEXT
FOR COMMUNITY COMMENT

This is a DRAFT version of this program element posted for community
comment. The scientific community is invited to make comments on this
draft solicitation, not only for clarity of the forthcoming
solicitation release, but also for inclusion of any ideas, strategies
or recommendations that will lead to submission of proposed instruments
capable of realizing transformational and compelling science. 
Similarly, the community is invited to comment on any constraints that
may be overly restrictive and preventing the submission of proposals
with creative, high-risk / high-return ideas.

NASA solicits questions and feedback about the scope of the
solicitation and requests for clarification. All questions or comments
should be emailed to kartik.sheth@nasa.gov by 11:59pm, Eastern time,
January 12, 2018. The anticipated date for the release of the
solicitation is January 19, 2018 with proposals due 90 days after the
release.
