UPDATE - ASSESSING NASA COMPLIANCE WITH THE PLANETARY DECADAL 
RECOMMENDATION FOR RESEARCH AND ANALYSIS PROGRAM FUNDING

NASA response to an analysis showing Research & Analysis programs were
underfunded $92.4M over FY13-FY16 relative to the recommendation of the
planetary decadal survey raises more questions. Response with
commentary has been posted at:

[NASA] DISCOVERY PROGRAM LONG-RANGE PLANNING INFORMATION

NASA intends to release an Announcement of Opportunity (AO) for
Discovery Program missions by February 2019. The Discovery Program
conducts Principal Investigator (PI)-led space science investigations
in SMD's planetary programs under a not-to-exceed cost cap. It is
anticipated that no more than three Discovery investigations will be
selected for 9-month, $3M (RY) Phase A concept studies through this AO. 

The intended time frame for this solicitation is:

Release of Draft AO:        September 2018
Release of final AO:        February 2019
Pre-proposal conference:    ~3 weeks after final AO release
Proposals due:              90 days after AO release
Selection for Phase A:      December 2019
Concept study reports due:  November 2020
Down-selection:             June 2021
Launch readiness date:      NLT December 31, 2026

The Discovery AO will be based on the Standard PI-led Mission AO
Template available at

http://soma.larc.nasa.gov/standardao/sao_templates.html

Proposers should read the Discovery AO carefully when it is released.

Further information will be posted on the Discovery Program Acquisition
Page as it becomes available at:

LPSC SESSION: THE TAURUS-LITTROW VALLEY 45 YEARS AFTER APOLLO 17

We are pleased to announce a LPSC special session on the Taurus-Littrow
Valley 45 years after Apollo 17. Forty-five years ago, Apollo 17
explored the Taurus-Littrow Valley. This session will re-explore
Taurus-Littrow, from what has been learned from samples, to the
analyses of remotely sensed data. Abstracts may include topics such as
origin, structure, and stratigraphy of the valley; modern analysis of
ALSEP data; pyroclastic deposits and their implications for lunar
origin; sources and nature of impact breccia clasts; isotopic dating
results and issues; regolith formation processes and history; mare and
pre-mare volcanism and cooling histories; thrust faults and their
global implications; and avalanche and debris flow origins and
dynamics. Both invited and contributed abstracts will be included. We
urge anyone interested to submit an abstract to this session (due 9
January 2018) and come and celebrate the last time humans walked on the
Moon.

POSITION OF DIRECTOR OF RESEARCH AT UNIVERSITY OF REIMS

A position of Director of Research (senior researcher) is open at the
CNRS (4th section), with the possibility for an external recruitment
(e.g. foreigners), for the  GSMA (Group of Molecular Spectrometry and
Atmosphere) at the University of Reims:

http://www.univ-reims.fr/gsma/

The topic of the section 4 - "Atoms and molecules, optics and lasers,
hot plasma physics" - explicitly includes atomic spectroscopy applied
to astrophysics. This competition may therefore concern candidates
producing research at the intersection of themes of Section 4 and GSMA
Planetary Sciences research (Planetary atmospheres and exoplanets).

EGU GENERAL ASSEMBLY SESSION: PLANETARY ANALOGS

Dear all,

We are organizing a session on planetary analogs (field, lab and
simulations) at the next EGU General Assembly (Vienna, April 8-13
2018). If you are working on a related project, please consider
submitting for this session. Abstract deadline is set up for January
10th (13h CET).

More information at:

http://meetingorganizer.copernicus.org/EGU2018/session/27766

Summary: Terrestrial analogues provide insights into geological and
biological processes that may have occurred on other planets. For
instance, Mars surface environments can be investigated by exploring
both present-day and past terrestrial environments. Conditions
representative of other extra-terrestrial environments, such as the
subsurface ocean of Europa, can be investigated on Earth or through
laboratory simulation and numerical experiments. At planetary analogue
sites, geochemical and geomorphologic response to biological activity
can be matched with recent in-situ investigations by landers and
rovers. Integration of in-situ experiments and remote sensing of Solar
System targets provides powerful comparative capabilities to analogue
studies. Inputs bridging across Geobiology, Planetary Geology and
Exobiology are welcome. 

Looking forward to (maybe) seeing you in Vienna,

The conveners, 

Jessica Flahaut, Angelo Pio Rossi, Barbara Cavalazzi, Monica Pondrelli,
Giuliana Panieri

http://worldwidetelescope.org/

The American Astronomical Society's WorldWide Telescope is a seamless
data visualization program with an engaging learning environment. The
WorldWide Telescope project enables terabytes of astronomical images,
data, and stories to be viewed and shared among researchers, exhibited
in science museums, projected into full-dome immersive planetariums,
and taught in classrooms from elementary school to college levels.

Learn to spruce up your paper and share your research with WorldWide
Telescope! 

This workshop is aimed at astronomy researchers of all levels. You
don't need to have any previous knowledge of WorldWide Telescope. Those
who wish to learn WorldWide Telescope for education or outreach are
encouraged to attend.

Topics:
WorldWide Telescope on the Web: Overview and how to use it.
Creating a WorldWide Telescope Tour
Sharing your tour: How to embed your tour on your website, in your
lk, and create a video abstract for your paper.

[NASA] ROSES-17 AMENDMENT: INSIGHT PSP CHANGES TO TEXT AND DUE DATES

Program element C.25 solicits investigations for the InSight
Participating Scientist Program (PSP).

This amendment removes the restriction on the use of data generated by
spacecraft, other than InSight, that were not publically available 30
days prior to the InSight PSP submission date. It is now the obligation
of the proposer to clearly demonstrate that the risk of failure to
acquire such data is sufficiently low and is offset by the benefit(s)
of the proposed task(s). Removal of this restriction allows for a more
diverse set of studies to be proposed including - but not limited to -
proposals involving concurrent, or simultaneous measurements to be made
by InSight and other mission(s). This amendment additionally clarifies
the requirements on members of non-InSight Flight Teams who propose to
this call (see Section 2.3). Lastly, this amendment adds a section on
award termination circumstances (see Section 3.5). New text is in bold
and deleted text is struck through.

The due dates have been delayed. Mandatory NOIs are now due January 18,
2018 and proposals are now due February 22, 2018.

Questions concerning this amendment may be directed to Robert Fogel at
rfogel@nasa.gov.
