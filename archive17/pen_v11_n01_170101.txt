ASTROBIOLOGY SCIENCE CONFERENCE SESSION ON THE MODERN MARS HABITABILITY

http://www.hou.usra.edu/meetings/abscicon2017

Abstracts due January 18, 2017
Meeting dates April 24-28, Mesa AZ

Modern Mars Habitability: Recent discoveries on Mars, including: 
Recurring Slope Lineae, ground ice, and active gully formation, have 
been interpreted as indications for the transient presence of water. 
The potential for liquid water on Mars has profound implications for 
the habitability of the modern Mars environment. This session solicits 
papers that examine the evidence for habitable environments on Mars, 
present results about life in analogs to these environments, discuss 
hypotheses to explain the active processes, evaluate issues for 
planetary protection, and explore the implications for future 
explorations of Mars.

Organizers: Carol Stoker, NASA Ames Research Center, and Alfred McEwen, 
LPL, University of Arizona
