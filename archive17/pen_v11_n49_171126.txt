MINI-WORKSHOP TO APPLY RECENT MODELS FOR ASTEROID AIRBURSTS TO THE
TUNGUSKA EVENT 

January 16, 2018
NASA Ames Research Center
Sponsored by the NASA Ames Asteroid Threat Assessment Project (ATAP) 

The discussion will include numerical models of Tunguska that can be
compared with Chelyabinsk. We also are inviting a few other asteroid
and meteor experts who are interested in this issue. We anticipate that
part of the participation will be virtual, but we hope most of the main
contributors can be present in person. The workshop will be publically
available on the Internet. We encourage presenters to write up their
conclusions, and we have arranged for these papers to be published
together in the same issue of Icarus. We will also prepare a summary of
the workshop for wide distribution.

Please reply to david.morrison@nasa.gov if you are interested in
participating in the mini-workshop, either in person or virtually.
Suggestions for topics and speakers are also welcome.
 
Confirmed Speakers and Topics as of November 17:

Michael Aftosmis
Mark Boslough
Peter Brown
Gareth Collins
Chris Johnson
Sarah McMullan 
Marian Nemec 
Darrell Robertson
Eric Stern 
Lorien Wheeler

EGU 2018 SESSION ON PLANETARY SPACE WEATHER
 
Please consider submitting an abstract to the session PS4.4/ST4.4
"Planetary Space Weather" to be held at EGU on 8-13 April 2018, in
Austria.

https://meetingorganizer.copernicus.org/EGU2018/abstractsubmission/
28519

The abstract submission deadline is 10 Jan 2018, 13:00 CET.

The emphasis of the session is on all aspects of plasma physics and
interactions of the interplanetary medium with the Solar System bodies,
including: (a) magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling dynamics and aurorae
(b) solar wind interaction with planets, moons, asteroids and comets
(c) plasma interactions with exospheres, dust and surfaces (d) surface
space weathering (e) potential impact of planetary environment on
technological space systems (f) comparisons amongst Earth and other
planetary environments.

We warmly welcome contributions based on previous (e.g. Cassini,
Chandrayaan-1, Kaguya, MESSENGER, Rosetta, Venus Express), present
(e.g. Juno, Mars Express, MAVEN), forthcoming (e.g. BepiColombo) and
planned (e.g. JUICE) missions. Analyses of ground-based observations of
neutral and ionized environments are welcome. Theoretical modeling and
simulations are also strongly encouraged, both in themselves and as a
basis for comparisons and interpretation of measurements. Laboratory
studies aiming to simulate the interactions on planetary analogues in
space are considered as well.

With best regards,
Anna Milillo, Philippe Garnier and Zhonghua Yao

[NASA] The InSight Participating Scientist Program

Program element C.25 solicits investigations for the InSight
Participating Scientist Program (PSP). The objectives of the program
are to: enhance the scientific return from the InSight mission by
broadening participation in the mission, and augment the existing
InSight science team to include new members conducting investigations
that broaden and/or complement the funded InSight Principal
Investigator (PI)-led investigations. The goal of the InSight PSP is to
maximize the contribution of InSight to the future exploration and
scientific understanding of Mars and the other terrestrial-type
planets. Because the intention is to enhance and broaden the scientific
return and augment the existing science team, investigations submitted
by the InSight Principal Investigator, Deputy Principal Investigator
and Co-Investigators will not be considered.

Selected Participating Scientists (PSs) will become full members of the
InSight science team and will work in a collaborative manner with other
InSight science team members after selection. PSs will have the same
rights and be required to fulfill many of the same responsibilities as
those of current science team Co-Investigators.

Mandatory NOIs are due January 11, 2018 and proposals are due February
15, 2018. For more details see:

2017/

TENURE-TRACK POSITION, ANALYTICAL COSMOCHEMISTRY

The Lunar and Planetary Laboratory/Department of Planetary Sciences,
University of Arizona, invites applications for a tenure-track faculty
position in the area of Analytical Cosmochemistry. Review of
applications begins on January 2, and continues until position is
filled. Starting date for the appointment is August 2018. Detailed
information and link to apply is at:

https://lpl.arizona.edu/faculty-jobs

Position is focused on  developing a research program in spatially
resolved isotopic analysis and overseeing a NanoSIMS laboratory.
Candidate will be expected to lead proposal efforts to acquire a
state-of-the-art NanoSIMS instrument, building on substantial
University support in terms of existing laboratory space and matching
funds. The NanoSIMS instrument will be housed in the Kuiper Imaging and
Characterization Facility. Successful candidate is expected to work
within this collaborative environment by consulting with other faculty,
laboratory managers, technical coordinators, students, and other
facility users. LPL faculty and research staff are engaged in many
aspects of planetary science, employing tools such as theoretical
studies and data analysis, laboratory and field investigations,
telescopic observations, remote sensing, and spacecraft development,
operations, and instrumentation. Candidates are encouraged to support
the department's diversity and inclusiveness efforts and to be
especially supportive of underrepresented communities including women
and minorities.
