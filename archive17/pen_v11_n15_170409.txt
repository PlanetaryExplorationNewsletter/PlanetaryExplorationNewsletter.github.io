NASA FRONTIER DEVELOPMENT LAB (FDL) APPLICATIONS OPEN

NASA Frontier Development Lab (FDL) has announced its 2017 challenges
and opened the application process for participants, with a deadline of
April 19, 2017. FDL is looking for 12 planetary scientists and 12
computer scientists with machine-learning emphasis. Applicants must
have a masters, doctorate or post-doc level of understanding in this
year's problem areas (Heliophysics, Astronomy, Exogeology, Data
Science, Software Engineering or Advanced Statistics). The challenge
questions for 2017 cover planetary defense, space weather and space
resources.

Hosted by the SETI Institute in Mountain View, CA, FDL is an applied
research accelerator established to tackle knowledge gaps in space
science by bringing together machine learning expertise and physical
science specialists at the PhD level. Interdisciplinary teams address
tightly defined problems and the format encourages rapid iteration and
prototyping to create outputs with meaningful application. The 2017
8-week program will accept 24 participants and will run June 26 -

ROSES-17 AMENDMENT 5: C.22 OREX-PSP FINAL TEXT

OSIRIS-REx launched September 8, 2016, with the primary objective of
traveling to the near-Earth (Apollo type, spectral class B) asteroid
101955 Bennu, obtaining a sample containing at least 60 g of regolith
material, and delivering this sample back to Earth. Once the spacecraft
reaches Bennu, a wide range of observations and measurements will be
made to characterize and map the asteroid, identify and characterize in
detail sites where samples might be collected, and finally to collect a
sample from the optimal site and stow it for delivery to Earth.

The objective of the OSIRIS-REx Participating Scientist Program
(OREx-PSP) is to enhance the scientific return during the
asteroid-operational phase of the OSIRIS-REx mission by expanding
participation in the mission through new investigations that broaden
and/or complement existing investigations.

Step-1 proposals are due May 4, 2017, and Step-2 proposals are due July
11, 2017. Questions and comments on this draft program element should
be directed to Jeffrey Grossman and or Christina Richey at
hq-orexpsp@mail.nasa.gov.

http://dart.jhuapl.edu/aida-workshop2017/

The 3rd AIDA International Workshop will be held June 20-22, 2017 at
the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory (JHU/APL) in Laurel,
Maryland. The AIDA project is a technology demonstration of asteroid
deflection by a kinetic impactor. It is an international cooperation
composed of two missions, the NASA DART (Double Asteroid Redirection
Test), which is the kinetic impactor, and the ESA AIM (Asteroid Impact
Mission). The combination of DART and AIM is AIDA. The first AIDA
international workshop took place in October, 2014, and the second AIDA
workshop was held in June, 2016.

The 3rd AIDA International Workshop will discuss planetary defense and
science topics: Predictions of momentum transfer by kinetic impactor;
determinations of momentum transfer from Earth-based remote sensing and
from in situ observations at the target [65803] Didymos; kinetic impact
simulations; Didymos physical properties and dynamical system, with
changes induced by kinetic impact; impact ejecta dynamical fates and
evolution; science proximity observations at Didymos. For additional

GEOSCIENCES FOR UNDERSTANDING HABITABILITY IN THE UNIVERSE

EGU Galileo Conference 
Terra Nostra Garden Hotel, Furnas, Azores 
25 - 29 September 2017

This conference will address some hotly debated questions in the field
including the following:
- What effects do core and mantle have on evolution and habitability of
planets?
- What is the relation between (plate) tectonics and atmospheric
evolution?
- What role does the mantle overturn play in the evolution of the
interior and atmosphere?
- What is the role of the global carbon and water cycles herein? 
- What influence do comet and asteroid impacts exert on the evolution
of the planet?
- How does life interact with the evolution of Earth's geosphere and
atmosphere?
- How can we use our knowledge of the solar system geophysics and
habitability for exoplanets?

The conference will be held at the Hotel Terra Nostra Garden, Furnas,
Sao Miguel, Azores, Portugal. The hotel is a newly renovated Art Deco
hotel witha large, famous botanical garden. The Joao Paulo Airport with
frequent direct flights to the European mainland is located only 45 km
