SCIENCE ENABLED BY A DEEP SPACE GATEWAY

NASA is sponsoring a three-day workshop to actively engage the
scientific community in the early stages of determining the ways in
which the deep space gateway concept could be used to facilitate
science. This workshop will be held February 27-March 1, 2018, in the
Denver area. The final location will be announced at a later date.

The intent of the workshop is to provide an open forum for the
presentation, discussion, and consideration of various concepts,
options, capabilities, and innovations to advance scientific discovery
from cislunar space. Attendance will be by invitation only based on
submitted abstracts. It is expected that some science investigations
may require the attention of a crew while other investigations may
simply use the gateway as infrastructure supplying power,
communications, etc.

The goal is to have parallel sessions covering Heliophysics, Earth
Science, Astrophysics, Fundamental Physics, Planetary Sciences, Life
Sciences, and Space Biology. Scientists from these communities will
discuss how the presence of the deep space gateway can enable
high-quality science.

Abstracts no longer than 2 pages are requested should be submitted to
through the workshop web page by Dec. 15, 2017:

2018 CALL FOR NOMINATIONS TO THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE OF THE EXOPAG

https://exoplanets.nasa.gov/exep/exopag/overview/

In the coming months, NASA anticipates making three new appointments to
the Exoplanet Exploration Program Analysis Group (ExoPAG) Executive
Committee (EC), to replace current members who have completed their
term of service on the ExoPAG EC. New appointments will be for a period
of 3 years. The ExoPAG is an open, interdisciplinary forum that
provides a conduit for community input into NASA's Exoplanet
Exploration Program (ExEP), and for conducting analyses in support of
ExEP science objectives and their implications for planning and
prioritization of Program activities. Together, the ExoPAG EC is
responsible for capturing and organizing community input, overseeing
analyses, reporting findings and inputs to the Astrophysics
Subcommittee, and keeping the scientific community apprised of ongoing
activities and opportunities within NASA's ExEP.

Detailed information about the structure and function of the ExoPAG and
call for nominations for the Executive Committee of the ExoPAG can be
found at:

http://exoplanets.nasa.gov/exopag

Nominations from individuals at academic institutions - university,
college, or non-NASA research laboratory - are strongly encouraged.
Self-nominations are welcome and nominations of early-career scientists
are especially encouraged. Nominations should be submitted via email to
Martin Still (Martin.Still@nasa.gov) by January 19, 2018.

SBAG EARLY-CAREER TRAVEL SUPPORT

We are planning to offer limited U.S. travel support for early career
scientists to participate in the SBAG 18 meeting, to be held at the
NASA Ames Research Center on January 17-19, 2018. Interested
undergraduate students, graduate students, postdocs, and other early
career scientists (within 3 years of PhD/MS/BS) should submit a 2-page
letter plus a CV to SBAG Early Career Secretary Angela Stickle
(angela.stickle@jhuapl.edu) and Hannah Susorney (hsusorney@eoas.ubc.ca)
by COB (5 pm Eastern) November 22, 2017. This should include a
demonstration of financial need and an explanation of how the
applicant's work relates to the purposes of the SBAG. The letter and CV
should be combined into a single PDF document. Recipients of travel
support will be expected to give a short presentation of their
SBAG-relevant work at the SBAG 18 meeting.

We are providing time on the agenda for early-career scientists and
engineers present at the meeting to introduce themselves and their
research to the community. This will include lightning talks with the
possibility of a small poster session to showcase your work. If you are
interested in participating, please contact the early-career secretary
(Angela.Stickle@jhuapl.edu) ASAP.

of Earth and Planetary Sciences looks forward to hosting all.

Conference information, including abstraction submission, registration,
activities, may be found at the conference website:

https://www.geosociety.org/se-mtg

Planetary-themed sessions: 
T14. Geologic Mapping from the Appalachians to the Planets

ELS LETTER OF INTENT TO PARTICIPATE

We are pleased to announce that the 6th European Lunar Symposium (ELS)
will be held in Toulouse, France May 13-16, 2018. This meeting,
organized in partnership with NASA's Solar System Exploration Research
Virtual Institute (SSERVI), will cover current advances and prospects
in lunar science and exploration in Europe and elsewhere.

Building upon successful previous ELS meetings and acknowledging a
growing interest in lunar science exploration worldwide, we anticipate
a larger number of participants for ELS 2018. In order to make
necessary logistical arrangements, we would like your help (before
abstract submission and registration dates are announced) in letting us
know before December 1st 2017 about your firm intention to attend ELS
2018.

NEW MINI-TES DATA IN ANALYST'S NOTEBOOK

Following the release to the Planetary Data System of
mirror-dust-corrected Mini-TES spectra from the Spirit rover, these
data are now available through the PDS Analyst's Notebook site:

https://an.rsl.wustl.edu/mera/merxbrowser/an3.aspx

As described in the "What's new" section, this data set was prepared by
Steve Ruff and funded by the NASA PDART program. It is archived by the
PDS Geosciences Node. The new data set adds mirror-dust-corrected
emissivity, emissivity standard deviation, and target temperature data
products to existing Spirit rover Mini-TES data in the Notebook. Graphs
of the emissivity and emissivity standard deviation products are
included.

Department of Astronomy at the University of Maryland, College Park.
The successful candidate will work with Professor Eliza Kempton on
theoretical radiative transfer calculations for exoplanet atmospheres.
Applicants should have previous experience in modeling (exo)planetary
atmospheres, although a variety of backgrounds may be relevant. The
position is for a period of up to three years, starting in fall 2018,
contingent on positive yearly progress evaluations. A Ph.D. in Physics,
Astronomy, or a related field is required prior to the start date. A

AGU PANEL DISCUSSION: PLANETARY BODIES IN THE ULTRAVIOLET

In recent years, UV spectroscopy techniques have provided significant
insights into volatiles, surface composition, and space weathering
effects on Solar System objects. At the AGU meeting in New Orleans,
please join us for session P23F, "Planetary Bodies in the Ultraviolet."
 We will hear about recent UV observations, from Earth-orbiting
telescopes and deep space probes, of Mercury, asteroids, comets, moons,
and plumes. We'll also hear about new lab work being done to aid in
interpreting these data. This will be a panel discussion with audience
participation. It's sure to be an engaging discussing and we hope to
see you there.

P23F, "Planetary Bodies in the Ultraviolet," on Tues Dec 12 1:40-3:40PM
(room R02/R03).
