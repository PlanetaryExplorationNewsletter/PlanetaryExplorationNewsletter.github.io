MRO SHARAD RAW DATA FROM RELEASES 23,24,33,34

The Planetary Data System (PDS) announces the release of new data from
the SHARAD instrument on the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO).

SHARAD raw data from the ASI (Italian Space Agency) SHARAD Ground
Operations Center have been released covering the periods April 22,
2012 - August 3, 2012 and August 10, 2014 - February 21, 2015. These
time periods correspond to previous MRO releases 23, 24, 33, and 34.
The SHARAD team is recovering data from deliveries that were missed due
to a hiatus in ground operations between June 2012 and March 2013. For
details, see the file ERRATA.TXT on the archive volume at:

http://pds-geosciences.wustl.edu/mro/mro-m-sharad-3-edr-v1/mrosh_0004/

INTERNATIONAL VENUS CONFERENCE 2018

The 74th Fujihara Seminar: "Akatsuki" Novel Development of Venus
Science

The Akatsuki team and community in Japan are pleased to announce the
2018 Venus conference, the successor of previous Venus conferences (La
Thuile (2007, 2008), Aussois (2010), Catania (2013), and Oxford
(2016)). The conference is intended to cover all areas of Venus
science with special focus on new results obtained from Japan's Venus
Climate Orbiter "Akatsuki". Results from previous missions, from
ground-based observations, numerical simulations, and theoretical works
of various aspects of Venus are all welcome.

Although the dates, 11-14 September 2018, will not be skiing season,
you will be able to enjoy a beautiful and comfortable resort in
Hokkaido. We hope this conference is fruitful and will contribute to
the advancement of planetary science.

Registration will open in early 2018.

35TH MEPAG MEETING: 1ST INFORMATION CIRCULAR

Members of the Mars community, 
 
I cordially invite you to participate in the 35th meeting of the Mars
Exploration Program Analysis Group (MEPAG), scheduled as a virtual
meeting on Monday, September 25th, 2017, 10:00am-1:00pm PDT.
 
Low-cost, "opportunistic" missions may provide a new way of advancing
Mars science through observations within the Mars system. This meeting
will inform the Mars community about recent work in this area through
reports on the mission concepts selected for study under NASA's
Planetary Science Deep Space SmallSat Studies (PSDS3) program
(https://www.nasa.gov/feature/nasa-selects-cubesat-smallsat-mission-
concept-studies). We will hear from the 5 teams selected with Mars
System proposals.

Additionally, we will report on MEPAG's involvement in the recent
Low-Cost Planetary Missions Conference (http://www.lcpm12.org/). There
will also be a presentation from a NASA HQ representative on the status
of discussions about future Mars mission architecture. 
 
The final agenda and connection information will be posted on the MEPAG
meeting website (http://mepag.nasa.gov/meetings.cfm) a few days
preceding the meeting. 
 
The meeting is open to all members of the Mars science community
including our international colleagues. I look forward to your
participation.
 
Sincerely, 
 
Dr. Jeffrey R. Johnson
MEPAG Chair

REQUEST FOR MISSION SUPPORTING OBSERVATIONS OF PATROCLUS-MENOETIUS
MUTUAL EVENTS

We encourage interested observers to plan observations of mutual events
of the Trojan binary system (617) Patroclus-Menoetius in semester
2018A. Contact times for the events and their photometric depth are the
measurement objectives.

The Patroclus-Menoetius binary system undergoes a series of mutual
events approximately every six years with the next season occurring
from October 2017 - June 2019. Individual events have a duration of up
to 8 hours, but the initial events will be short. Events occur with a
cadence of half the binary orbital period of 4.28 days. Multiple events
will be observable over the course of the 2018 apparition.
Patroclus-Menoetius is at opposition on 7 March 2018 with an apparent
magnitude of 15.9.

A detailed set of predictions is available upon request from Will
Grundy (W.Grundy@lowell.edu).

Patroclus and Menoetius are targets of the Lucy Discovery mission,
planned for launch in October 2021. Observations of the mutual events
will help refine the binary mutual orbit, which is critical for
planning the encounter. We encourage any interested observers to
communicate their plans to the Lucy Earth-based Observing Working group
lead, Richard Binzel (rpb@mit.edu).
