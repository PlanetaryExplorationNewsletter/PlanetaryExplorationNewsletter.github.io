POSTDOCTORAL RESEARCH ASSOCIATE, UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON, SEATTLE

Applications are invited for a postdoctoral position in the Dept. of
Earth and Space Sciences, University of Washington, to work on
numerical simulations and data analysis to understand the environment
in which life originated on the early Earth and potentially on other
planets. The position will be supervised by Prof. David Catling.

The postdoctoral associate will collaborate with a project group to do
research involving a variety of biogeochemical data analyses,
physical-chemical models, and Bayesian inverse models of the Earth
System and atmosphere. Models to constrain environmental conditions
during the origin of life and the spread of early life will also be
considered in the context of Earth-like planets elsewhere.

Applicants must hold a PhD in Earth and Space Sciences, or an
appropriately related field such as Astronomy, Planetary Sciences, or
Geophysics. The candidate should have an aptitude for numerical
modeling and have appropriate associated skills. The successful
candidate will also be encouraged to cooperate with researchers and
students in the university's cross-campus Astrobiology Program.

LUNAR GOLDSCHMIDT SESSION

The Moon-session at the 27th Goldschmidt Conference that will take
place in Paris, France, between the 13th and the 18th August, 2017 (the
week after MetSoc). This session is version II of the very successful
Moon-session at the meeting held at Yokohama in the past summer

We would like to encourage all angles of research (geochemistry,
modelling, remote, sensing, chronology) to participate in the session
"Heterogeneous Moon: Endogenous and Exogenous Processes in Lunar
Evolution."

The aim of this session is to combine lunar geochemistry,
geochronology, geophysics, and impact cratering on the Moon. Linking
chemical and physical models for the lunar evolution to temporal
constraints allows defining times and rates for its evolution. We
invite studies on the chemical and thermal evolution of the Moon from
geochemical and geophysical models and sample analyses in an effort to
converge efforts for an interdisciplinary approach to the research.
Processes such as impact cratering not only caused chemical
heterogeneities but also modified the surface morphology. Contributions
to challenge the current calibration of the lunar cratering rate are
welcome.

Session 2c under:

https://www.goldschmidt.info/2017/program/programViewThemes

Abstract submission opened on 1st January 2017 and runs until the 1st
April 2017.

ESA M5 CASTAWAY MISSION AND CUBESATS AT ASTEROIDS WORKSHOP 8 MARCH 2017

The Open University, Milton Keynes, UK

We invite the community to learn more about the CASTAway mission, an
asteroid belt survey and tour proposed to the ESA M5 call. This mission
combines a spectroscopic survey of >10,000 asteroids with close flybys
of 10-20. We will present details on the plans and opportunities for
community involvement. We invite contributions on either additional
uses of a telescope located in the asteroid belt or on ideas for
potential cubesat investigations in the asteroid belt, using CASTAway
as a launcher and communications relay (i.e. for probes released at
flybys). The meeting will take place at the Open University in Milton
Keynes, on Wednesday 8th March 2017.

More details, and a registration link, are available at:

UPDATE ON INTERNATION24 March 2017
Web site: http://lasp.colorado.edu/meetings/marsaeronomy2017

The conference will focus on the Mars upper atmosphere, ionosphere,
magnetosphere, and solar-wind interactions, their effects on loss of
atmospheric gas to space, and their dynamical and compositional
interactions with the lower atmosphere. Recent spacecraft missions
have provided tremendous new data sets that allow us to describe the
behavior of the upper atmosphere and plasma environment, understand the
underlying physical processes, and extrapolate atmospheric loss to past
epochs. This conference will bring together all of these aspects,
including pertinent observations, analyses, theoretical models, and
results.

AOGS2017 SESSION PS-11: EXPLORING THE SOLAR SYSTEM PRIMITIVE BODIES

August 6-11, Singapore

http://www.asiaoceania.org/aogs2017/public.asp?page=home.htm

Abstract deadline: February 15, 2017

This session welcomes abstracts about the studies of solar system small
bodies, using data from exploration missions, ground- and space-based
observatories, laboratory facilities, and theoretical studies. It also
welcomes abstracts about new concepts for future missions, observing
and laboratory facilities, and ideas for future studies. Abstracts
reporting the recent results from Dawn, New Horizons, and Rosetta
missions are especially welcome.

Solar system small bodies are considered the best-preserved fossils
from the early era of planetary systems formation. Small bodies could
also have played an important role in delivering water and organics to
the inner solar system, relevant to the origin of habitable worlds and
life. With the context of a big wave of recent small body missions,
this session is designed to promote the research of solar system
primitive bodies from multiple approaches and multiple disciplines, and
to help develop concepts for future studies and exploration missions.

Conveners:

Dr. Jian-Yang Li (PSI, USA), Dr. Makoto Yoshikawa (JAXA, Japan), Dr.
Eleonora Ammannito (UCLA, USA), Dr. Bin Yang (YNO, China)

HST EUROPA ADVISORY COMMITTEE

Jupiter's satellite Europa is a priority target for a NASA Flagship
Mission. Observations with Hubble show evidence for gaseous plumes
suggestive of outgassing from the sub-crustal ocean. There is high
scientific importance in learning more about potential Europa plumes,
their properties and locations. At the same time, HST observing time
is a precious resource, and in prior observations the duty cycle of
detections has been low.

The STScI Director has constituted a committee to provide advice on how
Hubble can best support planning for a future mission. One task of the
committee is to recommend an approach that appropriately balances the
science priorities against the resource requirements.

Further details can be found here:

https://confluence.stsci.edu/display/STUCP
/HST+Europa+Advisory+Committee

At this time, the Advisory Committee is soliciting input from the
community with regard to optimising Hubble observations of Europa. That
input may be relevant to any aspect of planning, scheduling and
executing observations, including suggestions for coordinating Hubble
programs with observations that might use other facilities.
Contributors should indicate whether their submission can be made
available to the broader community. The committee will maintain full
confidentiality if such is requested. Input should be submitted by
e-mail to europa@stsci.edu.

The deadline for receiving materials is February 10, 2017.
