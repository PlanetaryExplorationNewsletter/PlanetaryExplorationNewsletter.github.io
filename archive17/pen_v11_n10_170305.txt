PSS SPECIAL ISSUE INVITATION 

Dust, Atmosphere, and Plasma Environment of the Moon and Small Bodies 

The DAP-2017 workshop was held in Boulder on January 11th-13th. It was
focused on the open science questions, the status and future of our
supporting modeling and laboratory experimental capabilities, and the
definition of the required measurements and instrument capabilities for
future investigations from orbit or landed missions. The DAP-2017
presentations are available online:

http://impact.colorado.edu/dap_meeting.html

EPSC 2017 SESSION TP8.1: MARS’ UPPER ATMOSPHERE INTERACTION WITH COMET
C/2013 A1 (SIDING-SPRING) 

Dear all, 

We are convening a session at EPSC2017,"Mars’ upper atmosphere
interaction with comet C/2013 A1 (Siding-Spring)".

On October 19th 2014, Mars experienced a close encounter with Comet
C/2013 A1 (Siding Spring), at a distance of only 141,000 km, or one
third the Earth Moon distance. The gaseous coma washed over Mars and
Mars passed directly through the cometary debris stream. This unique
event enables the scientific community to investigate the response of
the Martian atmosphere, as this may have implications for overall
atmospheric evolution. The objective of the session is to bring
together all the multiple efforts of the scientific community in this
specific topic and to encourage people to continue studying the topic
in more deepness, as there are plenty of available data currently not
being used. All the aspects of the Mars-comet interaction are welcomed.

Please find more details on the session here:

http://meetingorganizer.copernicus.org/EPSC2017/session/26052

Deadline for abstract submission: May 3rd, 2017. 

With best wishes,

Beatriz Sanchez-Cano, Olivier Witasse, Matteo Crismani, and John Plane

REMINDER: IAVCEI SESSION I.1 PLANETARY VOLCANOLOGY

We invite you to submit an abstract to our Planetary Volcanology
session at the IAVCEI 2017 Scientific Assembly in Portland, OR on
August 14–18, 2014.

Volcanic activity is a hallmark of almost every large solid-surface
body in the Solar System. Giant volcanoes dominate the surfaces of
Venus, Mars, enormous calderas are abundant on Io, and large igneous
provinces are major physiographic features of Mercury and the Moon.
Each of these bodies also boasts evidence of pyroclastic activity, and
evidence of the interplay of volcanic and tectonic processes is
widespread. In the outer Solar System, numerous icy satellites (and a
dwarf planet) display evidence indicative of cryovolcanic activity. In
this session, we solicit contributions exploring the myriad styles of
volcanic landforms and processes on Solar System bodies (planets,
moons, or asteroids) using field observations, remotely sensed data,
laboratory or numerical simulations, or some combination thereof.

Please submit your abstract here: 

http://iavcei2017.org/abstract.html.

The submission deadline is March 17, 2017.

Conveners:
Paul K. Byrne (NCSU)
DelWayne R. Bohnenstiehl (NCSU)
Patrick J. McGovern (LPI)

Come hang out and talk planetary volcanology in Portland!
