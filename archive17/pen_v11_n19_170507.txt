WHITE PAPER ON THE VALUE OF NASA PARTICIPATING SCIENTIST PROGRAMS

A white paper has been posted to the LPI website, regarding the value 
of Participating Scientist (PS) programs within NASA's planetary 
mission portfolio. The paper, led by LPI Director Louise Prockter and 
coauthored by representatives of the NASA Analysis and Assessment 
groups (including Jeff Johnson and Serina Diniega of MEPAG), is based 
on data collected from surveys of the planetary science community and 
mission leadership. Overwhelming support was found for PS programs, 
which provide significant value in increasing intellectual and 
demographic diversity among mission science teams. The white paper's 
authors conclude that greater consistency in timing, funding, and 
approach could make PS programs even more effective and useful to 
NASA; as a result, they make eight recommendations, including that PS 
programs should be included on every planetary mission.

The paper is available at:

SOFIA CYCLE 6 CALL FOR PROPOSALS

The Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy (SOFIA) is pleased 
to announce the release of its Cycle 6 Call for Proposals (CfP) on 
May 1, 2017.  

The Call solicits proposals from the U.S., and international, 
astronomical community for approximately 500 hours of SOFIA 
observations, and is issued on behalf of NASA by the Universities Space 
Research Association (USRA). The proposal deadline is June 30, 2017, 
and the Cycle 6 observing period will be from February 2, 2018 to 
February 1, 2019. NASA expects approximately $5M to be available for 
support of U.S. affiliated investigators.

Instruments offered for Cycle 6 observations are: (1) the EXES mid-IR 
high-resolution spectrometer, (2) the FIFI-LS far-IR imaging 
spectrometer, (3) the FORCAST mid-IR camera, including its grism 
spectrometer, (4) the FPI+ camera in science mode, (5) the GREAT 
heterodyne spectrometer, and (6) The HAWC+ far-IR imager and 
polarimeter. New in Cycle 6 is the availability of the GREAT 
dual-array mode LFA/HFA, as well as two of the bands in the new 
lower-frequency 4GREAT receiver.

Starting with the Cycle 6 Call for Proposals the proposal category 
"Thesis Enabling Programs" is introduced, specifically aimed at 
supporting graduate student research.

"THEY PROMISED HER THE MOON" PERFORMANCE IN NYC

The play "They Promised Her the Moon" by Laurel Ollstein, directed by 
Valentina Fratti, will be performed off-Broadway in New York City,
May 12-27. 

Premise: Jerrie Cobb, one of the famed Mercury 13, whose test scores 
surpassed many of the male astronauts during rigorous psychological and 
physical testing in the early days of the country's space program, was 
almost the first woman in space. Cobb was reaching for the moon but hit 
the glass stratosphere, blocked not only by her gender but by notions 
of sisterhood and colliding egos. They Promised Her the Moon tells the 
inspiring story of one of the many women who have paved the way towards 
change.
