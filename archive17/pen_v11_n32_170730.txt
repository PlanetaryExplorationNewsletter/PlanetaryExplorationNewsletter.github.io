AGU SESSION 22722: LINKING SEDIMENT TRANSPORT AND GEOPHYSICAL FLOWS TO
PLANETARY SURFACE EVOLUTION (EP027)

https://agu.confex.com/agu/fm17/preliminaryview.cgi/Session22722

Invited speakers: Tim Goudge (University of Texas at Austin) and
Mackenzie Day (University of Texas at Austin)

Description: Planetary missions over the past decade have revealed that
while planetary bodies across the solar system differ greatly in
surface conditions, their landscapes share striking similarities to
those on Earth. Understanding the feedbacks between how geophysical
flows and sediment transport processes affect landscape evolution is
necessary for constraining the current and past climatic conditions on
such planetary surfaces. We invite contributions from research
exploring these interplays using remote sensing data from surface or
orbital missions, numerical modeling, laboratory experiments, Earth
analog studies, or some combination thereof. We expect that a joint
session between Planetary Sciences Section and the Earth and Planetary
Surface Processes Focus Group will foster collaborations between those
working to understand how geophysical flows and sediment fluxes modify
our own planet's surface under changing climates and those who are
working to understand how such surface processes behave in places with
vastly different conditions and constraints from our own.

Alexander Morgan (University of Virginia/Smithsonian Institution)

ASTROBIOLOGY 2017

This conference will take place in the beautiful Chilean Patagonia in
Coyhaique (November 26 - December 1, 2017). For updated information and
to pre-register, please see:

http://www.astrobiology2017.org

The oral contribution submission deadline has been extended to Friday,
August 4, 2017. Please note that a link to the abstract submission form
is sent to you after the registration process is completed. The SOC
will select oral papers after their review. The notification of
acceptance is expected to be sent out on August 25, 2017.

For those that wish to present a poster at Astrobiology 2017, the
deadline coincides with the end of the regular registration period,
October 13. The submission process is the same as for oral
contributions, and the selected posters are expected to be announced a
couple of weeks after the deadline.

There are only 21 available seats left at the Training School. Register
soon to secure yours. The two-day training school with lectures on
basics of Astrobiology will take place in Santiago during the
Friday-Saturday preceding the conference (November 24-25), and it is
open to early-career participants. For more information on the training
school, including the program, please click:

VENUS EXPLORATION ANALYSIS GROUP (VEXAG) CALL FOR STEERING COMMITTEE
MEMBERS

VEXAG is seeking a volunteer for VEXAG Steering Committee members to
replace those who have successfully completed their service to the
community. This new member will start late this year, commencing with
the next VEXAG Meeting at APL on November 14-16, 2017. The term will
run for three years.

Also, the VEXAG Early Career Scholars Focus Group is looking for
interested group members.

If you are interested, send your resume and a statement of how you
could contribute to VEXAG to Bob  Grimm and Martha Gilmore, VEXAG Chair
and Deputy Chair (grimm@boulder.swri.edu, mgilmore@wesleyan.edu) by
August 25, 2017.

VEXAG activities for the next three years are expected to be community
building with an emphasis on:

Preparing for the next Planetary Science Decadal Survey
Venus Exploration Goals, Objectives, and Strategies
Technology Development and Laboratory Measurements
International Collaboration
Early Career and Young Scholar Development

VEXAG (http://www.lpi.usra.edu/vexag/) is a community-based forum
established in July 2005 to assess scientific priorities and strategies
for exploration of Venus. VEXAG is currently composed of a chair and
five Focus Groups, where the Focus Groups actively solicit input from
the Venus community on the topics listed above.
