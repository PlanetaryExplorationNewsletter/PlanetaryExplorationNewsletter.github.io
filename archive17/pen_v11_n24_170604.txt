MICHAEL F. A'HEARN (1940-2017)

Michael Francis A'Hearn, a pioneer in the field of planetary science 
and comet research, the principal investigator of the NASA Deep Impact 
and EPOXI missions, and recipient of the American Astronomical Society
Division for Planetary Sciences Gerard P. Kuiper Prize, passed away at 
his home on Sunday, May 29, 2017. Born in Wilmington, Delaware in 1940, 
Mike received his Bachelors of Arts in Science from Boston College and 
his PhD from the University of Wisconsin, studying polarization of the 
atmosphere of Venus. An avid sailor, husband, and father of three, Mike 
made seminal discoveries regarding dust, ice, and gas emitted from 
comets early in his career. By searching for signatures in the Jupiter 
Family comets in comparison to the Oort cloud comets, he identified 
signatures of chemical gradients in the solar system's protoplanetary 
disk. 

Mike A'Hearn was well-loved by his students, highly respected by the 
entire planetary science community, and will be greatly missed by his 
family, friends, and colleagues.

NOTICE OF FUTURE CALL FOR NASA KECK KEY STRATEGIC MISSION SUPPORT 
PROGRAMS

NASA is a partner in the two 10-m telescopes of the William M. Keck 
Observatory. Access to NASA's share of this time on the Keck telescopes 
(~90 nights/year) is available to all astronomers resident at US 
institutions. Proposals are submitted biannually to the NASA Exoplanet 
Science Institute (NExScI). Observing time is awarded on the basis of 
scientific merit and the degree to which the proposed program supports 
NASA missions and/or strategic goals.

NASA sets aside 1/3 of its allocation for Key Strategic Mission Support 
programs (KSMS). In the 2016A semester, NASA selected three KSMS 
projects for a 2 year duration. All three programs end at the 
completion of the 2017B semester.

NASA is planning to release a new call for KSMS projects for the 2018A 
semester. Details of the opportunity and the proposal process will be 
announced in early in August 2017 with non-binding notices of intent 
due shortly thereafter. Proposals for the 2018A semester will be due 
on September 14, 2017. A KSMS project is typically multi-semester 
(10-60 nights, up to three years). The KSMS opportunity will be open 
for all topics/missions in astrophysics and planetary science.

JWST EXPOSURE TIME CALCULATOR (ETC) WEBINAR FOR SOLAR SYSTEM SCIENCE

ETC Webinar: Thursday, June 15, 12-1 PM EDT (US)

Webex info:

Meeting number: 640 002 474
Password: JWST2018

The General Observer (GO) Call for Proposals will be released on 
November 30, 2017, with a submission due date of March 2, 2018. Get 
ahead of the game by joining STScI's John Stansberry and Bryan Holler 
for a hands-on demonstration of the ETC in the context of Solar System 
observations. This webinar will also feature an overview of Pandeia, 
the downloadable ETC engine written in Python, and a request for 
community input on Pandeia tools and capabilities that would be useful 
for planning observations.

Attendance information and a recording of the webinar will also be

REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS: MAPPING OF WATER DEPOSITS TO SUPPORT MARS 
EXPLORATION PROGRAM STUDIES

The Jet Propulsion Laboratory will issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) 
on June 1, 2017 in support of NASA's Mars Exploration Program. This 
RFP will seek two data products focused on mapping water in various 
forms on Mars. These are: 

(1) A map of the distribution and concentration of subsurface water ice 
    within a predefined swath extending from low to high latitudes; and 
(2) A global map cataloging all known surface hydrated mineral deposits 
    and its characteristics.

The resultant products are intended to inform future NASA efforts to 
better understand the nature and viability of potential water resources 
on Mars, and options for accessing special regions in NASA's ongoing 
search for signs of life on Mars.

In addition, these results will be used to inform NASA's Mars Human 
Landing Sites Study (HLS2), and in accordance with NASA's Space Act 
Agreement, support the SpaceX landing site selection process.

Notices of Intent (NOIs) are optional, but highly encouraged, and will 
be due on June 15, 2017. The final proposal submission deadline is 
June 30, 2017.

Details of this RFP will be posted at:

ASTEROIDS: ASTRONOMICAL AND GEOLOGICAL BODIES

Asteroid science is key to furthering our understanding of planetary 
formation and the evolution of the Solar System. In this accessible 
book, Thomas H. Burbine presents a comprehensive introduction to 
asteroid science, summarising the astronomical and geological 
characteristics of asteroids, observational techniques, and past, 
present and future space missions. Based on an upper-level course on 
asteroids and meteorites taught by the author, this book is ideal for 
students, researchers and professional scientists looking for an 
overview of asteroid science. More details, including sample pages, at:

PLANETESIMALS: EARLY DIFFERENTIATION AND CONSEQUENCES FOR PLANETS

Edited by Linda T. Elkins-Tanton and Benjamin P. Weiss, this 
transdisciplinary volume presents an authoritative overview of the 
latest in our understanding of the processes of planet formation. 
Combining meteorite, asteroid and icy body observations with theory 
and modelling of accretion and orbital dynamics, this text also 
provides insights into the exoplanetary system and the search for 
habitable worlds. This is an essential reference for those interested 
in planetary formation, solar system dynamics, exoplanets and planetary 
habitability. More details, including sample pages, at:
