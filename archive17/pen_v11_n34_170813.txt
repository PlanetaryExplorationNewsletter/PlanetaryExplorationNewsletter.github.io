NASA POSTDOCTORAL FELLOWSHIPS

The NASA Postdoctoral Program offers US and international scientists 
the opportunity to advance their research while contributing to NASA's 
scientific goals. The NPP supports fundamental science; explores the 
undiscovered; promotes intellectual growth; and encourages scientific 
connections.

Selected by a competitive peer-review process, NPP Fellows complete 
one- to three-year Fellowship appointments that advance NASA's missions 
in earth science, heliophysics, planetary science, astrophysics, space 
bioscience, aeronautics and engineering, human exploration and space 
operations, and astrobiology.

Current NPP research opportunities in planetary science can be viewed 
here:

https://npp.usra.edu/opportunities/?filter_keywords=&filter_fields=145

Applicants must have a Ph.D. or equivalent degree in hand before 
beginning the fellowship, but may apply while completing the degree 
requirements. U.S. citizens, Lawful Permanent Residents, and foreign 
nationals eligible for J-1 status as a Research Scholar may apply.

Stipends start at $53,500 per year, with supplements for high 
cost-of-living areas and for certain academic specialties. Financial 
assistance is available for relocation and health insurance, and 
$8,000 per year is provided for professional travel.

Applications are accepted three times each year: March 1, July 1, and 
November 1.

NASA OPAG REGISTRATION NOW OPEN

Registration is now open for the Outer Planets Assessment Group (OPAG) 
meeting on September 6-7, 2017, at the Seaside Forum of the Scripps 
Institute of Oceanography, La Jolla, CA:

http://www.lpi.usra.edu/opag

at which the agenda is also available, or go directly to: 

http://www.cvent.com/d/d5q6r4/1Q 

Please make hotel reservations ASAP as this is still a busy season 
near the largest ocean in the inner Solar System. Block of rooms will 
be held until August 21. 

If you are interested in presenting a technology poster, contact 
Patricia.M.Beauchamp@jpl.nasa.gov.

If you wish to apply for early career support, see instructions on the 
OPAG web site.

Agenda items include updates about Europa Clipper, Europa Lander, 
Cassini, Juno, New Horizons, technology development, and planning for 
future missions to outer planets and ocean worlds.

EARLY CAREER PARTICIPANT SUPPORT FOR NASA OPAG MEETING

NASA's Outer Planets Assessment Group will provide travel grants for a 
limited number of interested Early Career participants to attend the 
OPAG meeting September 6-7 in San Diego, CA. OPAG plays a key role in 
sculpting the planetary science community's input into NASA activities 
for outer planets science and exploration. Thus it is critical for 
Early Career scientists to attend these meetings both to learn how 
NASA and Planetary Science programs operate and to represent the 
community that will work on OPAG-relevant projects in the coming 
decade. Selected individuals will present a poster at the meeting on a 
topic of their choosing. Interested graduate students, postdocs, and 
other Early Career scientists (within 5 years of PhD/MS/BS) should 
submit a one page letter of interest and a CV to britneys "at" 
eas.gatech.edu by August 16, 2017. Recipients will be notified by 
August 18. For more information, email Britney Schmidt.

PLUTO AFTER NEW HORIZONS CONFERENCE

July 15-19, 2019

We are planning an international science conference on the Pluto system 
and the Kuiper Belt to be held July 15-19, 2019 at the Johns Hopkins 
University Applied Physics Laboratory in Laurel, MD, USA.

Please mark your calendars accordingly!

This conference will provide an opportunity to summarize our 
understanding of the Pluto system and the Kuiper belt following the New
Horizons encounters with Pluto and 2014 MU69. Contributions spanning all
relevant research on the Kuiper belt, including both observations and
theory, will be solicited.

The conference will also serve as a nucleus for a forthcoming volume
"Pluto After New Horizons" in the University of Arizona Space Science
Series. With a projected 2020 publication date, this new book will be
the successor to "Pluto-Charon" published in 1997.

A registration website with further details will be set up next summer, 
approximately one year prior to the conference.

Again, please put this conference on your calendar and join us at the
Kossiakoff Center at APL in mid-July 2019!

With best regards,

Hal Weaver (JHU-APL), Alan Stern (SwRI), Rick Binzel (MIT)
(on behalf of the SOC)
