AGU SESSION 22335: POLARIMETRY AS AN INVALUABLE TOOL TO STUDY THE SOLAR
SYSTEM AND BEYOND (P033)

https://agu.confex.com/agu/fm17/preliminaryview.cgi/Session22335

We invite you to submit an abstract (deadline August 2, 2017) to our
session at the AGU Fall Meeting in New Orleans.

Polarimetry is a powerful observing tool and modeling technique,
providing information about astronomical objects. Applications include
characterization of solar system objects (Sun, Earth, planetary
atmospheres, aurorae, comets, asteroids, planetary satellites/ring
systems, dust, etc.) to the detection of exoplanets and identification
of biological markers in search of habitability. This session is open
to papers about observations of solar system bodies, theoretical or
experimental investigations, instrumental developments ground-based
facilities or onboard future space missions.

The session is cross-listed with A (Atmospheric Sciences), EP (Earth
and Planetary Surfaces Processes), and SH-SPA (Solar and Heliospheric
Physics).

AGU SESSION 23083: RADAR INVESTIGATIONS OF PLANETARY SURFACES AND
SUBSURFACES (P36)
 
Proposed and existing radar instruments are enabling an unprecedented
range of radio geophysical observations of the surfaces and subsurfaces
of solar system bodies. This has spurred the development and
application of new instrumentation, processing, modeling, analysis, and
interpretation approaches to planetary radar science and engineering.
We invite abstracts on any topic involving the use of radar data to
understand planetary bodies. These may describe (but are not limited
to) new results from existing radar observations, the development and
application of new observation or data processing techniques, numerical
modeling of existing or future observations, and/or the analysis of
airborne or orbital radar data from terrestrial analog studies for
solar system observation.

investigations that contribute to expanding the frontiers of solar
system exploration in diverse areas such as determining the thickness
of the ice sheets of ocean worlds, constraining the interior structures
of the planets and small bodies, monitoring of planetary atmospheric
dynamics and improvement of climate models, studying the scattering and
other properties of planetary surfaces, and research in fundamental
physics and solar system dynamics, among others. Technology topics
include the design of small spacecraft networks and constellations,
advances in flight and ground instrumentation, advancement in space
clock technologies, novel communications architectures including
optical links, and advances in radio and laser technologies, and new

AGU SESSION 24220: CRYOSPHERES OF TERRESTRIAL PLANETS (P009)

As the AGU abstract submission deadline draws closer, please consider
submitting an abstract to session P009, "Cryospheres of terrestrial
planets." We aim to bring together terrestrial geologists with
planetary scientists in a multi-disciplinary session on icy processes,
with a focus on Earth, Mars, and Ceres. 

Several bodies in the Solar System support widespread and long-lived
cryospheres, including the Earth, Mars, and Ceres. Processes on these
bodies are often similar, allowing for comparative planetology from
landform observations. However, each body has processes unique to
itself, such as liquid water interactions on Earth, carbon dioxide ice
on Mars, and cryovolcanism on Ceres. We invite abstracts on any topic
involving observations, modeling or analog fieldwork of the cryospheric
processes of these bodies and how they change through time. Abstracts
presenting new results from ongoing or recent investigations are
especially encouraged.

Abstracts may be submitted here:

AGU SESSION 24396: THE ORIGIN, EVOLUTION AND FATE OF COMETS - NEW
INFORMATION FROM ROSETTA (P044)

Comets are among the primitive building blocks of the planets, but as
they enter into the inner Solar System, they become dynamical bodies,
almost transient in nature. Some comets have broken up completely
(S/L-9 for example), while others have given up a little of themselves.
The recent and up-close study of 67/P Churyumov-Gerassimenko during
its 2015 perihelion passage has revealed in close detail the types of
changes comets undergo as they are heated by the sun.

This session will cover the dynamical nature of the nucleus and coma of
67/P as seen from Rosetta and ground-based observations. The session
will also include comparisons between the results from Rosetta and
other missions on how comets evolve through time. Broader topics such
as the chemistry of comets and what that reveals about their origin and
diversity are also welcome.

AGU SESSION 24909: TITAN AT THE END OF CASSINI-HUYGENS (P046)

Abstract deadline: August 2, 2017

https://agu.confex.com/agu/fm17/preliminaryview.cgi/Session24909

We invite you to submit your abstract to our session to be held at the
Fall 2017 AGU Meeting, described below:

During the 13 years of the Cassini-Huygens mission, the two spacecraft
have returned a wealth of scientific data that have revolutionized our
understanding of Saturn's largest moon, Titan. During 127 targeted
encounters, and numerous more distant flybys, the 18 instruments have
revealed Titan as a complex, Earth-like world, with arenas of lakes and
seas, vast equatorial dune fields, river channels, and meteorology with
huge rainstorms. More recently, we have learned that Titan has an
interior water ocean that may far eclipse the volume of water in the
Earth's oceans. In parallel with the mission results, new numerical
models of chemistry and climate, laboratory measurements and
simulations, have greatly extended our understanding of Titan's origin,
evolution, and present day processes. This session welcomes topical new
research on Titan, from Cassini-Huygens and beyond to include
laboratory work, modeling and observations of all types, showing our
revised understanding of this complex two-ocean world.

AGU SESSION 26201: USING TOPOGRAPHY TO INVESTIGATE THE EVOLUTION OF
SOLAR SYSTEM BODIES (P049)

Spacecraft data have enabled the surface topography of many solar
system bodies to be determined. These data provide insight into
near-surface processes and properties that exist over the visible
history of a body, on global and local scales. We invite abstracts on
any topic in which topography plays a role. These may describe
theoretical investigations, laboratory studies or data analysis of any
body in the solar system and can include (but are not limited to):
topographic measurements that are indicative of the types of surface
terrain or environments present; processes that create or erase/erode
surface topography at any scale; and subsurface processes that are
expressed by surface topography.

AGU SPECIAL SESSION (26632): PLANETARY SPATIAL DATA INFRASTRUCTURE
(P047)

11-15 December 2017
New Orleans, LA

Abstract submission is now open for a special session on Planetary
Spatial Data Infrastructure (PSDI) at:

https://agu.confex.com/agu/fm17/preliminaryview.cgi/Session26632 

Spatial Data Infrastructures (SDIs) support data analysis and research
using in situ and remotely sensed spatial data. The concept of an
infrastructure is to enable users to (1) efficiently discover data, (2)
experience improved data integration and usage and (3) engage in
collaborative research through integrated research environments. SDIs
have been developed for a wide range of topics using a myriad of
technologies.

The special session is soliciting abstracts focusing on best practices
for creating and managing spatial data infrastructure frameworks for
processing, analyzing, visualizing, serving and sharing Planetary
science spatial data.

AGU SESSION 26885: SYMPATHY FOR THE DATA - NOVEL APPROACHES AND
ADVANCES IN THE ART OF DATA VISUALIZATION (P042)

We invite the community to submit  abstracts to the AGU 2017 Fall
Meeting session "Sympathy for the Data: Novel approaches and advances
in the art of data visualization". We aim to bring together a diverse
range of geoscientists to discuss best practices, different platforms,
and emerging technologies being used and developed for data
visualization. This year we are especially encouraging submissions
related to virtual and augmented reality applications. The session is
listed in the Education section (and so doesn't count towards the 1
submitted, 1 invited abstract limit for the AGU Fall Meeting), and is
cross-listed with Public Affairs. This session is also being considered
for alternate presentation formats. Any questions can be addressed to
Martin Pratt (martin@seismo.wustl.edu). We look forward to your
contributions! 

https://agu.confex.com/agu/fm17/preliminaryview.cgi/Session26885

The AGU 2017 abstract submission deadline is 11:59 PM EDT on 2 August
2017. 

Many thanks for your consideration!

AGU SESSION 26997: IONOSPHERIC OUTFLOW FROM EARTH AND OTHER TERRESTRIAL
PLANETS (P021)

We would like to invite you to submit to the AGU session Ionospheric
Outflow From Earth and Other Terrestrial Planets (P021) at:

https://agu.confex.com/agu/fm17/preliminaryview.cgi/Session26997

On every terrestrial planet with an atmosphere, EUV radiation creates
ions in the upper atmosphere that may flow upward. If the ions are
energized enough, they can escape the gravitational potential.
Depending on the presence and nature of the planetary magnetic field,
there may be many different mechanisms causing ion upflow and outflow,
like particle precipitation, ambipolar electric fields driving a polar
or planetary wind, wave-particle interactions, direct solar
wind-ionosphere interactions, ion pick-up, etc. These escaping ions
contribute to the atmospheric erosion. Upflowing ions can be blocked by
an induced magnetosphere or trapped inside an intrinsic magnetosphere.
They may affect their plasma environment and even alter the dynamics of
the magnetosphere. This session invites contributions concerning all
the processes controlling ionospheric ion upflow and outflow on Earth,
Venus, and Mars, and their possible implications. Submissions comparing
the processes at different planets, similarities and differences, are
also encouraged.

AGU SESSION 27083: PLANETARY DATA SYSTEM - NEW DEVELOPMENTS IN DATA
ARCHIVING SECTION/FOCUS GROUP - EARTH AND SPACE SCIENCE INFORMATICS
(IN048)

Please consider submitting an abstract to the following session at the
fall 2017 AGU Meeting on new developments in Planetary Data System data
archiving (due August 2nd).

The Planetary Data System (PDS) archives a diverse set of unique
electronic data products from NASA planetary missions and NASA ROSES
investigations. All PDS-curated products are peer-reviewed, documented,
and available online. The PDS uses standards for describing and storing
data that address the data structure and contents. The current
formatting and archiving standard in the PDS is PDS4. PDS4 is designed
to modernize the online data system and to improve the efficiency of
data ingestion and delivery by supporting scalable data storage and
delivery architectures needed to provide access to continually
increasing data holdings. This special session focuses on new
developments in PDS including: updates to the Information Model, PDS4
concepts, data, bundle and collection design, product label
development, policies, tools, metadata, and standards. This general
session should be of high interest to those involved in missions and
small data archiving products wishing to archive data within the NASA
PDS.

[NASA] ROSES-17 AMENDMENT 15: SSW NOIS, NOT STEP-1 PROPOSALS

ROSES-17 Amendment 15: Program element C.2 Solar System Workings no
longer uses a two-step proposal submission process common in Appendix
C.

The Solar System Workings (SSW) program element supports research into
atmospheric, climatological, dynamical, geologic, geophysical, and
geochemical processes occurring on planetary bodies, satellites, and
other minor bodies (including rings) in the Solar System. This call
seeks to address the physical and chemical processes that affect the
surfaces, interiors, atmospheres, exospheres, and magnetospheres of
planetary bodies. A wide range of investigations will be covered,
including theoretical studies, analytical and numerical modeling,
sample-based studies of extraterrestrial materials, field work,
laboratory studies, and data synthesis relevant to the physical and
chemical processes affecting planetary systems.

This program element no longer uses the two-step proposal submission
process common in Appendix C. Instead, a Notice of Intent (NOI) is
requested by November 16, 2017. Proposals are now due February 1, 2018.
The list of Data Analysis Programs (DAPs) following the fourth
paragraph in Section 2.1, Exclusions, was deleted to remove the
potential implication that this list was exhaustive or completely
described what type of proposals each DAP solicited.

13-15, 2017) will be held at the European Space Research Technology
Center (ESTEC), in Noordwijk, the Netherlands.

Each workshop will include a mixture of presentations about the promise
of JWST for solar system science, specifics on observer planning tools
and observatory capabilities, and hands-on training and Q&A with the
planning tools. Observations of solar system targets approved for
guaranteed-time observers (GTOs) and through the Early Release Science
(ERS) program will be summarized. The workshop is timed to support JWST
cycle-1 open time proposals, which are expected to be due in February,
2018.
