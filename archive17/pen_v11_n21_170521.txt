PLANETARY EXPLORATION NEWSLETTER CELEBRATES ITS 10TH ANNIVERSARY

The first Planetary Exploration Newsletter was released on May 24, 
2007. This is the 581st newsletter. Today PEN has 3280 subscribers 
worldwide, and the number continues to grow. We would like to thank 
our colleagues in the international planetary community who have made 
this newsletter of value and the past editors whose weekly efforts over 
the years has made it possible:

2010-2017, Susan Benecchi
2009-2016, Melissa Lane
2007-2010, Nic Richmond
2007-2009, Matt Balme

As we note at the end, PEN is a service provided by the Planetary 
Science Institute (http://www.psi.edu) using no NASA funds. All 
editorial work is volunteer.

CALL FOR SMALL MICROGRAVITY EXPERIMENTS

The NASA Astromaterials group at JSC is looking for ideas for small 
microgravity experiments that can be sent to the International Space 
Station (ISS). Following on the success of our Strata-1 asteroid 
regolith investigation (see description below), we are developing a 
new ISS microgravity facility called Hermes. This facility is open to 
experiments of any kind, from small-body investigations to testing 
equipment to anything you can think of. It will house small experiments 
up to 12"x4"x4". The facility is reconfigurable and new experiments can 
be incorporated into Hermes over time. At a minimum, Hermes can provide 
cameras, lights, power, communication, and electrical connections for 
mechanical or actuation devices. Pending future funding, NASA may 
provide flight opportunities. If you have any ideas for experiments or 
studies that can be performed in such a facility, please respond to the 
following RFI. The response simply requires a maximum of 5 pages 
(shorter is fine) emailed to Kristen John (kristen.k.john@nasa.gov) 
with your idea.

COMMUNITY ANNOUNCEMENT REGARDING EUROPA LANDER INSTRUMENT INVESTIGATION 
PROGRAM ELEMENT APPENDIX

This community announcement is an advance notice of NASA's Science 
Mission Directorate (SMD) plan to release a Program Element Appendix 
(PEA) for the Third Stand Alone Missions of Opportunity Notice 
(SALMON-2) for instrument investigations for a Europa lander mission. 
This opportunity will solicit proposals describing the full lifecycle
development and operation of instrument investigations. Proposed 
investigations will be evaluated and selected through a two-step 
competitive process, with approximately 10 proposals selected for 
Step 2. The Step 2 Phase A Concept Study will be capped at 
approximately twelve months and a $1.5M (FY2018) budget per 
investigation. At the conclusion of these studies, NASA may downselect 
some concept studies to complete Phase A and subsequent mission 
phases.

Further information will be posted as it becomes available on the 
Europa Lander Acquisition Page at: 

http://europalander.larc.nasa.gov/

Huygens probe and their instruments has just been released in the US by 
Haynes.  The "Cassini-Huygens Owners' Workshop Manual" is a 
large-format 196-page book in full color, with 325 images and is 
available on amazon.com, presently at $32.

THE RINGED PLANET - CASSINI'S VOYAGE OF DISCOVERY AT SATURN

Written for the general audience with an emphasis on the fundamental 
physics of planetary systems, The Ringed Planet is a fascinating 
exploration of the Saturn system that places Saturn in the context of 
the solar system as a whole. Cassini's instruments have revealed 
Enceladus and Titan to have subsurface oceans of liquid water. Its 
cameras have returned stunning images of rings in turmoil, a tumbling 
moon, the only extraterrestrial lakes known in the solar system, a 
hexagon of clouds, some of the highest mountains in the solar system 
and much more. Its final series of orbits before a planned crash into 
Saturn in September 2017 will reveal details of the interior structure 
of Saturn as well as provide unprecedented views of the rings. More 
than a journey of discovery at Saturn, The Ringed Planet is also an 
introduction to how planetary systems work.
