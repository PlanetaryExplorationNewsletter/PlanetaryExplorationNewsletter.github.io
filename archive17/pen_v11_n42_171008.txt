ENVIRONMENTS OF TERRESTRIAL PLANETS UNDER THE YOUNG SUN: SEEDS OF 
BIOMOLECULES

Symposium will be held on April 9-13, 2017, hosted by the Sellers 
Exoplanet Environments Collaboration at NASA Goddard Space Flight 
Center, Greenbelt, MD, USA. This symposium is a major international 
interdisciplinary conference in the emerging area of astrobiology 
covering astrophysical, physico-chemical, atmospheric and geological 
aspects of environments of early terrestrial planets with a focus on 
the impacts of the young Sun's space weather on the precursors of life.

The understanding of impacts of external factors on prebiotic chemistry 
including UV and particle fluxes from the young Sun (and other active 
stars) along with the physio-chemical evolution of planetary 
atmospheres under the influence of their volcanic and tectonic activity 
will sharpen our definition of habitability on early terrestrial and 
terrestrial-type exoplanets. It will also help to specify environmental 
constraints for prebiotic atmospheric chemistry experiments that will 
better specify the most plausible pathways to the origin of life. This 
is only possible by forming a key linkage between astrophysics, 
heliophysics, planetary scientists, Earth science and the prebiotic 
chemistry/origin of life community. 

Please contact Dr. Vladimir Airapetian at vladimir.airapetian@nasa.gov 
for further details.

DPS EVENT: FUTURE PLUTO AND KUIPER BELT MISSIONS WORKSHOP

Sunday, 3:30 pm at DPS Provo, Battle Creek Room

Interested DPS members please join us Sunday, October 15th, from 
3:30-5:30 pm for a focused workshop on future missions to the Kuiper 
Belt. The workshop will take place in the Battle Creek room of the 
Utah Valley Convention Center (DPS conference venue). No 
pre-registration required. 

The Kuiper Belt (KB) is a scientific treasure trove consisting of 
comets, planetesimals, and small planets like Pluto. Since its 
discovery in the early 1990s, the KB has yielded fundamental insights 
into planetary accretion, the migration of planets, and the population 
structure of our solar system-including the discovery that dwarf 
planets like Pluto are common there.

In this workshop we will review the scientific case to return to 
Pluto with an orbiter, as well as the scientific case to explore other 
small KB planets and smaller bodies with flybys or orbiters. We will 
go beyond this to discuss possible mission payloads. Finally, we will 
solicit community and individual scientist interest in future studies 
leading to the next Decadal Survey.

DPS EVENT: CARBONACEOUS ASTEROIDS - CONNECTIONS BETWEEN SURFACES AND 
INTERIORS

Time: 10/18/2017 from 12pm to 1pm.
Location: Battle Creek - Provo Utah Convention Center

Planetary Resources, the asteroid mining company, is developing 
methodology to quantify water abundance on volatile-rich C-complex NEAs 
in order to perform resource assessment. While spectral measurements in 
the visible to near-infrared regions can reveal a NEA's hydration 
state, these reflectance measurements are only sensitive to the optical 
surface. Additionally, spectral measurements of surface hydration (and 
spectral measurements in general) can be affected by poorly understood 
processes that may hinder accurate resource assessment. As such, a 
deeper understanding of the underlying mechanisms affecting asteroid 
surfaces is required. The goal of this workshop is to bring together 
experts from across multiple disciplines to facilitate a broad 
technical discussion around this complex challenge. Topics of interest 
for discussion include but are not limited to space weathering, thermal 
processing of asteroid surface material, carbonaceous chondrite 
mineralogy, regolith formation and sorting, solar wind implantation of 
H, and any other processes that may affect the quantification of water 
on asteroids.

PHD POSITION IN SPACE PHYSICS, UPPSALS, SWEDEN

Applications are invited for a PhD student position to study the plasma 
environment of Mars. Big questions remain regarding the topic - did 
ancient Mars lose most of its primordial atmosphere in to space, and 
how can we address this using current day measurements? Specifically, 
the aim of the project is to develop detailed understanding of 
electrodynamic processes at the day-night boundary, where steep 
gradients in plasma density and temperature are found. Intense, varied 
crustal magnetic fields, along with dynamic fields induced by the solar 
wind flowing past the planet are also significant here. The new PhD 
student will work directly with experimental data from both the ESA 
Mars Express and NASA MAVEN missions.

The position is available at the Uppsala office at the Swedish 
Institute of Space Physics (IRF), located at the Angstrom Laboratory in 
Uppsala, Sweden, starting in 2018 for a total duration of four years.
