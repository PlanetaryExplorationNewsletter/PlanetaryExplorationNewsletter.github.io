SUMMER INTERNSHIPS AT JOHNS HOPKINS APPLIED PHYSICS LAB (APL)

APL is looking for the next generation of explorers! The 2017 APL NASA
Intern Program provides unique opportunities for university students to
work on NASA missions or other space-related research projects. The
internship program runs 10 weeks in the summer and applications are due
March 26; however, selections are made on a continuous basis, so
interested students should apply as early as possible. More information
is available at:

http://www.jhuapl.edu/NASAIntern/

MAGNETOSPHERES OF THE OUTER PLANETS, 

12-16 JUNE 2017
Uppsala, Sweden

Abstract submission and registration for the 2017 MOP meeting in
Uppsala, Sweden, is now open at:

https://goo.gl/forms/2J38pNwpZyF3Qshy2

The meeting will take place in the Angstrom Laboratory, Uppsala, and is
hosted by the Swedish Institute for Space Physics, the Royal College of
Technology, and Uppsala University.

Presentations are solicited for original research on any aspects of the
magnetospheres, ionospheres, and thermospheres of Jupiter, Saturn,
Uranus and Neptune, and interactions of their moons with these systems.
We expect that particular focus will be given to recent results from
Juno, and anticipation of the Cassini "Grand Finale". Comparative
studies are welcome, provided the focus is within the scope of the
conference. Deadline for abstract submission is 31 March 2017.

The conference fee will be 4500 SEK (including tax). Current PhD
students registering before the deadline are offered a reduced
registration fee of 3000 SEK. This fee includes lunches (Monday-
Friday), coffee breaks, refreshments at poster sessions, Sunday evening
icebreaker, a short excursion, and the conference banquet.

TITAN THROUGH TIME 4

April 3-5th 2017 NASA Goddard Space Flight Center

Abstract submission is currently open for the 4th Workshop on "Titan
Through Time: Formation, Evolution and Fate" until WEDNESDAY FEBRUARY
15TH, 2017. As in previous years, we invite contributions on Titan's
atmosphere, surface and interior evolution; ongoing observations of
seasonal change; modeling of all types; laboratory work, and other
topics that give insight into Titan's unique character.

Missions: as well as new results from Cassini-Huygens, we have recently
confirmed invited speakers on the subject of two recently announced
mission proposals to Titan in the New Frontiers "Ocean Worlds"
category: A Titan Orbiter, and a Titan Lander.

2017 NASA PLANETARY SCIENCE SUMMER SEMINAR APPLICATIONS OPEN

NASA is accepting applications from science and engineering post-docs,
recent PhDs, and doctoral students, as well as engineering students
within 6-9 months of completion of their masters degree (but not
planning to pursue a PhD degree), for its 29th Annual Planetary Science
Summer Seminar (previously named Planetary Science Summer School),
which will be held July 24-28, 2017 at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in
Pasadena, Calif.

During the program and pre-session webinars, student teams will carry
out the equivalent of an early mission concept study, prepare a
proposal authorization presentation, present it to a review board, and
receive feedback. By the end of the session, students will have a
clearer understanding of the life cycle of a space mission;
relationships between mission design, cost, and schedule; and the
tradeoffs necessary to stay within cost and schedule while preserving
the quality of science.

Applications are due April 3, 2017. Partial financial support is
available for a limited number of individuals. Further information is
available at:

http://psss.jpl.nasa.gov

CALL FOR ABSTRACTS FOR THE IAPSO-IAMAS-IAGA CONFERENCE, SESSION A02

A02 - Earth's core dynamics and planetary dynamos 
IAPSO-IAMAS-IAGA
Conference Capetown, South Africa 
27 August-1 September 2017

Earth's geomagnetic field is just one of a diverse array of planetary
magnetic fields within our solar system. Common to each planet is a
core of electrically conducting fluid whose motion is responsible for
generating its magnetic field. Magnetic observations can therefore be
used to probe the internal structure and dynamics of planetary
interiors, including the inaccessible deep Earth.

This symposium will focus on recent advances in both observation of
magnetic fields from satellites, ground-based data and other sources
and associated modelling including dynamo models and planetary
evolution. Contributions to the ongoing debate concerning the thermal
history of the Earth and associated implications on the geomagnetic
field by a stratified layer are particularly welcome.

The abstract deadline is 12 March 2017.

NASA POSTDOCTORAL FELLOWSHIPS

The NASA Postdoctoral Program offers US and international scientists
the opportunity to advance their research while contributing to NASA's
scientific goals. The NPP supports fundamental science; explores the
undiscovered; promotes intellectual growth; and encourages scientific
connections.

Selected by a competitive peer-review process, NPP Fellows complete
one- to three-year Fellowship appointments that advance NASA's missions
in earth science, heliophysics, planetary science, astrophysics, space
bioscience, aeronautics and engineering, human exploration and space
operations, and astrobiology.

Current research opportunities in planetary science can be viewed here:

https://npp.usra.edu/opportunities/?filter_keywords=&filter_fields=145

Applicants must have a Ph.D. or equivalent degree in hand before
beginning the fellowship, but may apply while completing the degree
requirements. U.S. citizens, Lawful Permanent Residents, and foreign
nationals eligible for J-1 status as a Research Scholar may apply.

Stipends start at $53,500 per year, with supplements for high
cost-of-living areas and for certain academic specialties. Financial
assistance is available for relocation and health insurance, and $8,000
per year is provided for professional travel.

Applications are accepted three times each year: March 1, July 1, and
November 1.

EUROPA LANDER SDT REPORT RELEASED

The SDT report for the pre-Phase A study of a Europa lander mission
concept has been released and is available at:

http://solarsystem.nasa.gov/docs/Europa_Lander_SDT_Report_2016.pdf 

Community members are encouraged to read the report and attend a town
hall event on Sunday, March 19, from 12:30-5 pm at LPSC.  The town hall
is intended to provide an extended opportunity to communicate the
science content of the report to the scientific community and, equally
importantly, to engage in constructive discussion with the scientific
community. A second town hall will take place on the afternoon of
Sunday, April 23, at AbSciCon. For questions please contact Dr. Curt
Niebur at curt.niebur@nasa.gov.

AOGS 2017 ABSTRACT DEADLINE

Due this coming Wednesday, February 15, 2017
Session PS-11: Exploring the Solar System Primitive Bodies
August 6-11, Singapore

http://www.asiaoceania.org/aogs2017/public.asp?page=home.htm

This session welcomes abstracts about the studies of solar system small
bodies, using data from exploration missions, ground- and space-based
observatories, laboratory facilities, and theoretical studies. It also
welcomes abstracts about new concepts for future missions, observing
and laboratory facilities, and ideas for future studies. Abstracts
reporting the recent results from Dawn, New Horizons, and Rosetta
missions are especially welcome. Solar system small bodies are
considered the best-preserved fossils from the early era of planetary
systems formation. Small bodies could also have played an important
role in delivering water and organics to the inner solar system,
relevant to the origin of habitable worlds and life. With the context
of a big wave of recent small body missions, this session is designed
to promote the research of solar system primitive bodies from multiple
approaches and multiple disciplines, and to help develop concepts for
future studies and exploration missions.

Conveners: 
Dr. Jian-Yang Li (PSI, USA) 
Dr. Makoto Yoshikawa (JAXA, Japan) 
Dr. Eleonora Ammannito (UCLA, USA) 
Dr. Bin Yang (YNO, China)
