IN MEMORIAM: VON R. ESHLEMAN (1924-2017)

Von R. Eshleman died peacefully in late September, five days after his
93rd birthday. Although he began his career in radar astronomy, he is
best known as a pioneer in the use of spacecraft radio signals for
precise measurements in planetary exploration -- specifically, the
radio occultation method for profiling planetary atmospheres and
ionospheres, which has now been "brought home" for monitoring Earth's
atmosphere using GPS satellites. He was involved in early Mariner
missions to Mars and Venus, and he was the leader of the Radio Science
Team on Voyager through the Jupiter encounters. In later years he
worked on ring dynamics, gravitational focusing of electromagnetic
waves, and anomalous retro-reflection from icy surfaces. A longer
obituary may be found at:

42nd SCIENTIFIC ASSEMBLY OF THE COMMITTEE ON SPACE RESEARCH (COSPAR)
 
The Committee on Space Research (COSPAR) will hold its 42nd Scientific
Assembly in Pasadena, California, USA, on 14-22 July, 2018. The COSPAR
Scientific Assemblies supply a forum to all scientists involved in
space research for the presentation of their latest scientific results,
the exchange of knowledge and also the discussion of space research
problems.
 
Abstract submission is now open (deadline 9 February, 2018)

THEMIS GEODETICALLY CONTROLLED MOSAICS AVAILABLE FROM THE USGS

THEMIS infrared preliminary geodetically controlled mosaics, updated
spacecraft pointing and orientation information (i.e., preliminary
smithed SPICE kernels), and supporting documentation are available for
download from the USGS Astrogeology Science Center. All daytime
infrared and nighttime infrared mosaics +/-65 deg of the equator are
currently available. These preliminary mosaics are tied to a known
coordinate system (USGS Viking Orbiter MDIM 2.1), spatially adjusted to
align feature boundaries, and orthoprojected at 100 m/pixel scale.
Final adjustments are being processed and will result in final mosaics
being released in September 2018. This process results in sub-pixel
registration between images, and knowledge of the accuracy of that
registration and the location of features, and the daytime IR and
nighttime IR mosaics to be well-registered to one another. These
products enhance our knowledge (e.g., position, precision, and
accuracy) of image placement and the location of small-scale surface
features, and will benefit the current and future orbital acquisition
of data, the planning of spacecraft and surface operations, and allows
for easier and improved intercomparison of all Mars data sets.

Several product types are available, including DTMs, orthoimages, and
slope maps. The orthos and slope maps are listed under "Derived
Products" on each DTM product page. The ortho and slope product pages
also contain links back to the DTM they were derived from.

USGS Astrogeolgoy also generated HiRISE DTMs for InSight landing site
selection, and those DTMs are all available via the HiRISE DTM release
page:

MOLA-HRSC MERGED DTM MOSAIC AVAILABLE FROM THE USGS

This data product is a blend of digital elevation model (DEM/DTM) data
derived from the Mars Orbiter Laser Altimeter (MOLA) instrument aboard
NASA's Mars Global Surveyor spacecraft (MGS) and the High-Resolution
Stereo Camera (HRSC) aboard the European Space Agency's Mars Express
spacecraft. This product was created in support of thermal modelling
studies (Fergason et al. 2017; Laura 2016), but may also be of interest
to the broader planetary community. A cell-size of 200 meters/pixel was
chosen as a compromise between up-sampling the MOLA (463 meters/pixel)
and down-sampling the HRSC DEMs (50 to 100 meters/pixel).

This is an interim product only. The HRSC Team is currently generating
HRSC DEM mosaics (level 5 products) that cover 5 deg by 5 deg regions,
and these mosaics are of superior quality to this hybrid product. We
highly recommend using the level 5 HRSC products, when they become
available.

PLANETARY DEFENSE COORDINATION OFFICE NEAR EARTH OBJECTS OBSERVATIONS
PARTNERSHIPS REQUEST FOR INFORMATION
 
Through this Request for Information (RFI) NASA's Planetary Defense
Coordination Office (PDCO) is soliciting capability statements to
identify private sector and philanthropic organizations that could
contribute to the Near-Earth Object (NEO) Observations Program. This
RFI will be used for planning purposes only and will be internally
reviewed. NASA will use the information obtained as a result of this
RFI on a non-attribution basis. Responses of up to 10 pages must be
submitted by November 13, 2017, via NSPIRES in response to
NNH17ZDA009L.

The specific objective of this RFI is to seek information on
organizations that NASA's PDCO could partner with to enhance the NEO
Observations Program and specific information on their capabilities
that could aid in this Survey.

Previous relevant experience is also of interest. Capability areas that
PDCO is interested in include but are not limited to:
 
1. Data Processing and Management
2. Detection and Tracking
3. Follow-Up
4. Characterization

Please refer to the full text of this RFI which is posted as a PDF on
the NSPIRES web page at NNH17ZDA009L for background information,
response guidelines, and other details.

NEOWISE 2017 DATA RELEASE

The 2017 data release for NEOWISE was in June 2017. The 3-year NEOWISE
archive now contains over 7.7 million calibrated image sets and over 57
billion source detections overall. As of mid-September 2017, NEOWISE is
55% into its eighth sky coverage since the start of the Reactivation
mission. Over 691,000 infrared measurements have been made of 27,628
different solar system objects, including 735 NEOs and 128 comets.

IRSA: New Time Series Tool and Coming IRTF Archive

(1) IRSA has a new Time Series Tool:

http://irsa.ipac.caltech.edu/irsaviewer/timeseries

This tool allows exploration and analysis of time series observations.
For WISE/NEOWISE and PTF, users can view measurements as a function of
time, simultaneously visualize the single-epoch images, and optionally
find the period of variability. Partial functionality is available for
other data sets.

This video playlist collects all the relevant movies on the Time Series
Tool:

(2) IRTF archive coming to IRSA

Starting in Feb 2018, IRSA will host the public archive for the
NASA/Infrared Telescope Facility (IRTF). The archive will serve raw
data from the SpeX and iSHELL instruments.

ENVIRONMENTS OF TERRESTRIAL PLANETS UNDER THE YOUNG SUN: SEEDS OF
BIOMOLECULES

Symposium will be held on April 9-13, 2018, hosted by the Sellers
Exoplanet Environments Collaboration at NASA Goddard Space Flight
Center, Greenbelt, MD, USA. This symposium is a major international
interdisciplinary conference in the emerging area of astrobiology
covering astrophysical, physico-chemical, atmospheric and geological
aspects of environments of early terrestrial planets with a focus on
the impacts of the young Sun's space weather on the precursors of life.

The understanding of impacts of external factors on prebiotic chemistry
including UV and particle fluxes from the young Sun (and other active
stars) along with the physio-chemical evolution of planetary
atmospheres under the influence of their volcanic and tectonic activity
will sharpen our definition of habitability on early terrestrial and
terrestrial-type exoplanets. It will also help to specify environmental
constraints for prebiotic atmospheric chemistry experiments that will
better specify the most plausible pathways to the origin of life. This
is only possible by forming a key linkage between astrophysics,
heliophysics, planetary scientists, Earth science and the prebiotic
chemistry/origin of life community.

Please contact Dr. Vladimir Airapetian at vladimir.airapetian@nasa.gov
for further details.
