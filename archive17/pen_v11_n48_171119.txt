2018 PIERAZZO INTERNATIONAL STUDENT TRAVEL AWARD

Application deadline: 9 PM PST, November 30, 2017

Awards will be announced on or before December 9, 2017

This award is established by the Planetary Science Institute in memory 
of Senior Scientist Betty Pierazzo to support and encourage graduate 
students to build international collaborations and relationships in 
planetary science. Two awards will be made each year, contingent upon 
there being meritorious applications. One will be awarded to a graduate 
student working on his or her Ph.D. at an institution within the U.S. 
This is to support travel to a planetary science related meeting 
(conferences and workshops) outside of the U.S. The second award will 
be to a graduate student working on his or her Ph.D. at an institution 
outside of the U.S. This is to support travel to a planetary science 
related meeting within the U.S. These include general meetings that 
have planetary-focused sessions such as the AGU, GSA, EGU and IAG.

The award will consist of a certificate and up to $2000US.

AGI PANEL DISCUSSION: PLANETARY BODIES IN THE ULTRAVIOLET

In recent years, UV spectroscopy techniques have provided significant 
insights into volatiles, surface composition, and space weathering 
effects on Solar System objects. At the AGU meeting in New Orleans, 
please join us for session P23F, Planetary Bodies in the Ultraviolet. 
We will hear about recent UV observations, from Earth-orbiting 
telescopes and deep space probes, of Mercury, asteroids, comets, moons, 
and plumes. We'll also hear about new lab work being done to aid in 
interpreting these data. This will be a panel discussion with audience 
participation. It's sure to be an engaging discussing and we hope to see 
you there.

P23F, Planetary Bodies in the Ultraviolet, on Tues Dec 12 1:40-3:40PM 
(room R02/R03).

CTX DTMS FOR MARS2020 LANDING SITE CHARACTERIZATION AVAILABLE FROM THE 
USGS

The CTX DTM products generated by the USGS Astrogeology Science Center 
for the Mars 2020 landing site characterization are publicly available 
in the PDS Annex. All CTX DTMs generated for this effort are linked 
below:

Several product types are available, including DTMs, orthoimages, and 
slope maps. The orthoimages and slope maps are listed under "Derived 
Products" on each DTM product page. The orthoimages and slope product 
pages also contain links back to the DTM they were derived from USGS 
Astrogeology also generated HiRISE DTMs for Mars 2020 landing site 
selection, and those DTMs are all available via the HiRISE DTM release 
page:

NAU PLANETARY SCIENCE AND ASTRONOMY PH.D. STUDENT OPPORTUNITIES

The Department of Physics and Astronomy at Northern Arizona University 
is recruiting excellent students to undertake a Ph.D. in Planetary 
Science and Astronomy. We are currently searching for several planetary 
surfaces-focused students to undertake projects related to analog 
science, orbital remote sensing of Mars and other planetary bodies, 
and rover-based science. Students in this dynamic and growing Ph.D. 
program have the opportunity to tailor their curriculum and course 
load to meet their academic and scientific goals. Close collaboration 
with the USGS Astrogeology Science Center, combined with our planetary 
surfaces-focused students, postdocs and faculty members lends to a rich 
community of planetary science researchers in Flagstaff, Arizona. In 
addition, northern Arizona provides numerous opportunities for 
terrestrial analog studies, ranging from Meteor Crater, Grand Canyon, 
and the San Francisco volcanic field to nearby sand dune fields and 
seasonal river channels.

Applications are due January 1. For more information, including a list 
of current faculty members and their research interests, as well as how 
to apply to our program, please see:

Please do not hesitate to contact any member of our department for 
additional information, especially Christopher.Edwards@nau.edu, 
Mark.Salvatore@nau.edu, and Nadine.Barlow@nau.edu.

ASTROBIOLOGY SCIENCE STRATEGY FOR THE SEARCH FOR LIFE IN THE UNIVERSE: 
CALL FOR WHITE PAPERS

In preparation for and as an input to the upcoming decadal surveys in 
astronomy and astrophysics and planetary science, the National 
Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine has been charged with 
carrying out a study on the astrobiology science strategy as it relates 
to the search for life in the solar system and extrasolar planetary 
systems: 

http://sites.nationalacademies.org/SSB/CurrentProjects/SSB_180812 

The committee is requesting community input in the form of white 
papers. Please find recommended topics for white papers and submission 
guidelines at the following website: 

http://sgiz.mobi/s3/Astrobiology-Strategy-Call-For-Papers 

White papers will be accepted from immediately until 8 January, 2018. 
Papers received earlier will have a higher likelihood of being read and 
considered. Please note that multiple authorship accurately reflecting 
a consensus among many individuals is strongly encouraged. Everyone in 
research communities associated with astrobiology is encouraged to 
author or collaborate on these papers.
