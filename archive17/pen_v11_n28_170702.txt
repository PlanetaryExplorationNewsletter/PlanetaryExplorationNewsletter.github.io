AGU SESSION 21994: MERCURY - NEW DISCOVERIES, FUTURE OPPORTUNITIES

We are pleased to announce a session on Mercury at the 2017 AGU Fall 
Meeting in New Orleans, LA, December 11-15, 2017.

NASA's MESSENGER mission returned unprecedented measurements of 
Mercury's surface, interior, exosphere, and magnetosphere that 
collectively have revolutionized our understanding of the innermost 
planet. We solicit contributed papers on data analysis, ground-based 
observations, laboratory measurements, and theoretical developments 
that contribute to our understanding of Mercury's geological evolution, 
its geophysical and geochemical characteristics, and the interaction of 
its exosphere and magnetosphere with the solar wind and interplanetary 
magnetic field. We also welcome papers on future mission opportunities, 
as well as how MESSENGER discoveries can inform questions to be 
addressed by the upcoming ESA-JAXA BepiColombo mission to Mercury.

Please consider submitting an abstract for this session. For more 
information, visit:

AGU SESSION 22664: MAGNETOSPHERES IN THE INNER SOLAR SYSTEM

We invite submissions to 'Magnetospheres in the Inner Solar System', 
a session to be held at the Fall 2017 AGU Meeting, described below:

The structure and dynamics of each planetary magnetosphere (intrinsic 
and induced) in the inner solar system are driven by a unique set of 
factors including the nature of its magnetization, atmosphere-
ionosphere coupling, and local solar wind parameters. To provide a 
forum for discussion of recent data analysis and modeling efforts 
concerning the inner planet magnetospheres, this session welcomes 
submissions on the intrinsic magnetospheres of Mercury and Earth, as 
well as the induced magnetospheres of Venus and Mars. It will focus on 
general magnetospheric processes including, but not limited to: 
solar wind-magnetosphere interaction, magnetosphere-ionosphere 
coupling, plasma acceleration and transport, magnetic reconnection, 
wave instabilities, magnetotail dynamics, and bow shock physics. We 
strongly encourage comparative studies of these inner solar system 
magnetospheres with each other or with other planetary magnetospheres 
throughout the solar system. Results from various missions such as 
MESSENGER, BepiColombo, VEX, MEX, MGS, MAVEN, and more, are actively 
solicited.

AGU SESSION 22722: LINKING SEDIMENT TRANSPORT AND GEOPHYSICAL FLOWS TO
PLANETARY SURFACE EVOLUTION

We aim to bring together geomorphologists studying diverse landscapes 
across the solar system.

https://agu.confex.com/agu/fm17/preliminaryview.cgi/Session22722

Invited speakers: 
Tim Goudge (University of Texas at Austin) 
Mackenzie Day (University of Texas at Austin)

Planetary missions over the past decade have revealed that while 
planetary bodies across the solar system differ greatly in surface 
conditions, their landscapes share striking similarities to those on 
Earth. Understanding the feedbacks between how geophysical flows and 
sediment transport processes affect landscape evolution is necessary 
for constraining the current and past climatic conditions on such 
planetary surfaces. We invite contributions from research exploring 
these interplays using remote sensing data from surface or orbital 
missions, numerical modeling, laboratory experiments, Earth analog 
studies, or some combination thereof. We want to foster 
collaborations between those working to understand how geophysical 
flows and sediment fluxes modify our own planet's surface under 
changing climates and those who are working to understand how such 
surface processes behave in places with vastly different conditions 
and constraints from our own.

AGU SESSION 23187: CLIMATIC EVOLUTION OF VENUS AND VENUS-LIKE 
EXOPLANETS

https://agu.confex.com/agu/fm17/preliminaryview.cgi/Session23187

Abstract deadline: August 2, 2017

Although Venus today is hostile and uninhabitable, recent studies have 
shown that its climate evolution is complex and could permit early 
habitable conditions. For example, recent 3-D modeling studies have 
showed that Venus may have been habitable for a large fraction of our 
solar system's history (e.g. Yang et al. 2014, Way et al. 2016). Also, 
it has been suggested that alternate modes of plate tectonics could aid 
volatile cycling on timescales congruent with stable climates on 
Venus-like worlds (e.g. Lenardic et al. 2016). Advances in 
understanding the climates of Venus-like planets are important not only 
to understanding the evolution of our nearest planetary neighbor, but 
also to understanding Venus-like exoplanets, which may represent a 
cosmically ubiquitous type of world (Kane et al 2014). This session 
hopes to explore recent advances in understanding the evolution of the 
Venusian climate to provide a more complete view of Venus and 
Venus-like exoplanets.

AGU SESSION 23303: CERES AND VESTA - UNDERSTANDING THE "PLANETS" OF THE
ASTEROID BELT

We encourage abstract submissions related to geologic, spectroscopic, 
compositional and geophysical analyses of Ceres and Vesta. Possible 
topics include analyses of Dawn data, telescopic observations, 
analytical interior modeling, and numerical modeling of impact events
and/or tectonic activity. Comparative analyses with other small bodies 
are welcome.

AGU SESSION 23867: THE URANUS AND NEPTUNE SYSTEMS, AND THEIR RELATION
TO OTHER PLANETS

https://agu.confex.com/agu/fm17/preliminaryview.cgi/Session23867

This session encompasses all aspects of ice-giant systems: the 
magnetospheres, satellites, rings, atmospheres, and interiors of 
Uranus and Neptune; their formation and evolution; and their relation 
to other planets in and beyond our solar system. Uranus and Neptune 
present us with several mysteries, including how they form, how their 
magnetic fields are generated, the energy balance of their atmospheres, 
and the nature of their rings and satellites, particularly those seen 
to be active (Triton) or with young surfaces (Miranda, Ariel). Radial 
migration of the ice giants may have had significant impact on the rest 
of the solar system. Looking beyond our system, the Kepler planet-
finding spacecraft has shown that ice giants are common in our galaxy:  
most planets known today are thought to be ice giants. Observations, 
modeling, and theory related to the ice giants will inform the design 
of missions to Uranus and Neptune which are currently under 
consideration.

AGU SESSION 24418: EXPLORING THE SURFACE PROPERTIES OF THE MOON, 
ASTEROIDS, AND OTHER AIRLESS BODIES

The close collaboration between science, technology, and exploration 
enables a deeper understanding of the Moon and other airless bodies as 
our manned missions move further out of low-Earth orbit, return to the 
Moon, visit a Near Earth Asteroid (NEA), and venture towards Mars and 
its moons, Phobos and Deimos. This session will feature 
interdisciplinary, exploration-related science focused on all airless 
bodies targeted as potential human destinations. Areas of study 
reported here will represent the broad spectrum of lunar, NEA, and 
Martian moon sciences, encompassing investigations of their surface, 
interior, and near-space environment, as well as the science uniquely 
enabled from these bodies. Early career scientists are especially 
encouraged to submit abstracts for oral presentations.

AGU SESSION 24739: IF YOU SEE SOMETHING, SAY SOMETHING - EXPLORING THE
WEIRD AND WONDERFUL FEATURES OF THE SOLAR SYSTEM

Satellite data acquired from NASA and international missions provide a 
wealth of information about the geologic features of rocky and icy 
bodies throughout the solar system. Comparing these features with 
features on Earth and other Solar System bodies can inspire hypotheses, 
and yield important insights about how geologic processes operate and 
differ across bodies. Sometimes, however, we encounter geologic 
features for which we have no ready comparison. This session is aimed 
at exploring these features in more detail and exposing the wider 
community to them. We encourage you to submit unusual features (however 
you chose to define unusual), and particularly encourage the submission 
of features that have left you scratching your head. Presenters will 
briefly introduce unexplained observations of geologic (tectonic, 
volcanic, aeolian, glacial, etc.) features. The session will then 
allow time for discussion so that the community can bring combined 
knowledge to better understand the weird and wonderful geologic 
features throughout the solar system. This session encourages 
planetary and terrestrially-focused scientists to come together to 
combine their observations and expertise.

AGU SESSION 25981: PLANETARY THERMOPHYSICS

https://agu.confex.com/agu/fm17/preliminaryview.cgi/Session25891

Planetary surface and subsurface temperature measurements are greatly 
contributing to the telescopic and robotic exploration of the Solar 
System. They are often analyzed in conjunction with numerical models 
or laboratory experiments, and shed light on fundamental questions 
related to regolith formation and maturation, presence/stability of 
volatiles, habitability, interactions with atmospheres, heat flow and 
deep structures, surface changes, etc. This session aims at sharing 
recent results stemming from these efforts, and welcomes all 
contributions focused on planetary geological/geophysical processes 
constrained through the lens of thermophysics. Presentations relevant 
to minor bodies, satellites, and (exo)planets based on data analysis, 
numerical modeling, or laboratory experiments are also encouraged.

EXPLORING THE PLANETS - A MEMOIR

Fred Taylor's memoir is described by reviewers as 'A highly readable 
romp through [his involvement in] the great planetary space missions 
produced by NASA and then ESA ... in the last 50 years. He writes of 
the individuals involved ... the politics that often rides roughshod 
over scientific endeavour ... and the internal workings of university 
departments. A wonderful read for those interested in the history and 
politics [of solar system research] by a key player in the field, and 
a source of inspiration for those who will carry on into the next era'.
