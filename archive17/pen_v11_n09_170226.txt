INFORMATION SESSION AT LPSC ON POST-DOC OPPORTUNITIES AT NASA GODDARD

Are you interested in a postdoctoral position at NASA's Goddard Space 
Flight Center? Join scientists from Goddard's Solar System Exploration 
Division (http://science.gsfc.nasa.gov) for an information session at 
LPSC on Tuesday, March 21st at Noon in the Grogans Mill Room. We'll 
discuss available opportunities and pathways, through the NASA 
Postdoctoral Program, cooperative agreements, and the NAI and SSERVI, 
as well as professional development opportunities like the Planetary 
Science Winter School, and other aspects of Goddard that make it a 
great place to work.

If you can't make the lunchtime meeting, we will also hold an informal 
gathering prior to the Tuesday evening poster session for those that 
would like to talk more, or who can't make the noontime meeting. We 
will meet at Grimaldi's Pizza at 5:00 PM for food and discussion.

Please email Noah Petro (Noah.E.Petro@nasa.gov) if you have any 
questions.

NEW MEPAG GOALS COMMITTEE CHAIR

Mars community members,

We are pleased to announce that Dr. Don Banfield (Cornell University) 
has agreed to serve as the next MEPAG Goals Committee Chair. 
Dr. Banfield is an atmospheric scientist, who has studied the giant 
planets and Mars from both remote sensing and in situ perspectives. 
He has been associated with the Voyager flyby of Neptune, Galileo at 
Jupiter, and the MER Rovers; was a Participating Scientist for Mars 
Polar Lander and Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter; and is a Co-I on InSight. 
He succeeds Dr. Victoria Hamilton (Southwest Research Institution), who 
we deeply thank for the years of service that resulted in two MEPAG 
Goals Document revisions (2012 and 2015).

The full listing of MEPAG Goals Committee members can be found at: 

https://mepag.jpl.nasa.gov/about.cfm

Thank you,

Dr. Jeffrey R. Johnson
MEPAG Chair

FAR INFRARED NEXT GENERATION INSTRUMENTATION COMMUNITY WORKSHOP

Thursday, March 23, 2017
Caltech, Pasadena, California

Community input is sought for far-infrared instrument needs across 
multiple platforms (balloons, SOFIA, sub-orbital, FIR probes). Bring 
your knowledge of what science gaps we still have in the far-IR and 
how we can shape our existing and future platforms to get these 
measurements. We hope to see you there.
 
More information at: 

https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/~mmacgreg/FIR_SIG/workshop.html
 
Registration is open for the workshop:

If you are unable to attend in person, you may join us by Webex. 
Your inputs will be important contributions to the discussion at 
the workshop. 
 
Please leave your ideas as answers to questions in Section 2 of 
the registration form:

Sign-up is also available for a tour of your SOFIA Observatory in 
Palmdale, Calif., on Friday, March 24, 2017 morning (transport 
to/from Pasadena provided).

PLANETARY GIS DATA SPECIALIST SOUGHT

Sagan Center at the SETI Institute, Mt. View, California

The Planetary GIS Data Specialist is responsible for producing 
"research ready" cartographic and geospatial data for various projects. 
This work involves interfacing with the supervisor to determine the 
data processing strategy for a particular project and then executing 
that strategy.

Responsibilities: Image processing of experimental data records up to 
map projected images, mosaicking of images, production of digital 
terrain models from stereo pairs of images, production of other data 
products derived from the above, production of visualizations of the 
above data products, and work with supervisor to find the best ways to 
perform various kinds of cartographic analyses.

Qualifications: Masters degree or equivalent experience in geographic 
information systems, experience working with planetary data, 
experience with Unix operating systems, experience with the 
Integrated Software for Imagers and Spectrometers software, and some 
programming experience (any language).

VENUS MODELING WORKSHOP - ABSTRACT DEADLINE EXTENSION

Update: In order to avoid conflicts with the SSW deadline, the workshop 
organizing committee has extended the abstract deadline until Thursday, 
March 2.

Details: Researchers using any combination of analytic, numerical, or 
empirical modeling to study Venus' orbital environment, atmosphere, 
surface, or interior are invited to submit abstracts to the Venus 
Modeling Workshop to be held May 9-11, 2017 in Cleveland, OH adjacent 
to NASA's Glenn Research Center. This 2.5 day event is being convened 
for interested researchers to share the state of knowledge, approaches, 
tools, and data sets currently in use. Discipline-specific roundtable 
discussions will identify needs for future data products and 
investigative resources that can enable deeper understanding of the 
past, present, and future of Venus.

NASA POSTDOCTORAL FELLOWSHIPS

The NASA Postdoctoral Program offers US and international scientists 
the opportunity to advance their research while contributing to NASA's 
scientific goals. The NPP supports fundamental science; explores the 
undiscovered; promotes intellectual growth; and encourages scientific 
connections.

Selected by a competitive peer-review process, NPP Fellows complete 
one- to three-year Fellowship appointments that advance NASA's missions 
in earth science, heliophysics, planetary science, astrophysics, space 
bioscience, aeronautics and engineering, human exploration and space 
operations, and astrobiology.

Current research opportunities in planetary science can be viewed here:

https://npp.usra.edu/opportunities/?filter_keywords=&filter_fields=145

Applicants must have a Ph.D. or equivalent degree in hand before 
beginning the fellowship, but may apply while completing the degree 
requirements. U.S. citizens, Lawful Permanent Residents, and foreign 
nationals eligible for J-1 status as a Research Scholar may apply.

Stipends start at $53,500 per year, with supplements for high 
cost-of-living areas and for certain academic specialties. Financial 
assistance is available for relocation and health insurance, and 
$8,000 per year is provided for professional travel.

Applications are accepted three times each year: March 1, July 1, and 
November 1.

NOMINATIONS FOR NASA FEDERAL ADVISORY COMMITTEE

Due: March 8, 2017

NASA invites public nominations for service on four new Federal 
advisory committees that advise NASA on science. The four new 
committees, which were formerly subcommittees of the NASA Advisory 
Council, are The Astrophysics Advisory Committee (APAC), The Earth 
Science Advisory Committee (ESAC), The Heliophysics Advisory Committee 
(HPAC), and The Planetary Science Advisory Committee (PAC).

U.S. citizens may submit self-nominations for consideration to fill 
vacancies on these four new committees. There will be member vacancies 
from time to time throughout the year, and NASA will consider 
self-nominations to fill such intermittent vacancies. Nominees will be 
contacted only if a vacancy should arise and the expertise of the 
nominees is appropriate for that specific vacancy. The deadline for 
NASA receipt of all public nominations is March 8, 2017.

For more information, please see the federal register notice at:
