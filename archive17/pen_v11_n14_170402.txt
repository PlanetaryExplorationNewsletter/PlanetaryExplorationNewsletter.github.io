POSTDOCTORAL RESEARCHER AT ARIZONA STATE UNIVERSITY

The NSF-funded SIMS facility at Arizona State University (ASU) is
seeking a Postdoctoral researcher to start in August 2017. This
position is in the laboratory of Dr. Maitrayee Bose, a new Assistant
Professor in the School of Earth and Space Exploration (SESE), who will
oversee the NanoSIMS (Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry) instrument at
ASU. She investigates the isotopic properties of dust grains and
organics formed in stellar and nebular environments. She also studies
the volatile component of tiny grains, including samples from asteroid
Itokawa. Details of research projects will be discussed in person, but
will involve use and development of high resolution isotopic
measurements using the NanoSIMS.

Prior analytical experience with SIMS/NanoSIMS instrumentation is
required, but familiarity with the specific research involved is not a
prerequisite. The successful candidate should have a PhD before Aug
2017 in a relevant field (e.g. geology, physics, materials physics,
solid state chemistry) and should have a track record of publication in
peer-reviewed international journals, together with good communication
skills for presenting results at international meetings.

Candidates interested in the above position should contact Maitrayee
Bose (mbose2@asu.edu or 480-965-4244) as soon as possible.

XVIIIth INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON THE ORIGIN OF LIFE

The XVIIIth International Conference on the Origin of Life will be held
July 16-21, 2017 in San Diego, CA. This conference provides an
important opportunity for planetary scientists, astronomers, chemists,
natural historians, and others to meet and tackle the issue of the
transition from non-living systems to the living state.

Topics of interest include

* the physical and chemical environments on the early Earth;

* studies on the evolution of life at its earliest stages;

* identifying the traces left in the geological record;

* checking the possibility that a similar process could have evolved in
  other places of the solar system or exoplanets; and

* considering the philosophical and historical issues associated with
  the developments of these research approaches.

Early career researchers are especially encouraged to attend.

The abstract deadline is April 11.

TAKE THE PLANETARY MAP SURVEY (MAPSIT)

Please take a few minutes to fill out this short anonymous survey about
planetary map creation and use. This request takes <5 minutes and
covers all types of mapping efforts focused on non-terrestrial bodies. 

http://bit.ly/map_input

Poll results will help inform how planetary geoscience mapping efforts
can be improved. Results and paths forward will be posted on the MAPSIT
webpage by end of summer:

http://www.lpi.usra.edu/mapsit

Please forward the above link as needed to interested community
members. Thank you in advance for your time.

VOLUNTEER AS A TOTAL SOLAR ECLIPSE SUBJECT MATTER EXPERT

Join NASA's efforts to engage the public about the August 21, 2017
total solar eclipse by volunteering as a Subject Matter Expert! NASA
welcomes scientists, engineers, science writers, amateur astronomers,
and science educators to identify themselves as subject matter experts,
or SMEs, available and interested in supporting programs around the
nation on August 21. By volunteering, groups seeking an expert speaker
can reach out to you to join their event. To be considered as a SME,
you will need to have a minimum understanding of selected eclipse
content. Before filling out the application form you must download
and review eclipse training documents. In addition, you must meet the
following requirements: 

* Be at least 21 years of age.
* Have a basic working knowledge of astronomy especially eclipses and
  the sun-Earth-Moon system.
* Be available to support a solar eclipse event somewhere in the 
  country as a speaker/eclipse educator. 

For more information, access to eclipse training documents, and to
apply, visit:
