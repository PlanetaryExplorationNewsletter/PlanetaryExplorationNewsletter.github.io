ASTROBIOLOGY SCIENCE CONFERENCE SESSION: MODERN AND ANCIENT 
BIOSIGNATURES AND THE SEARCH FOR LIFE ON MARS

The burden of proof for confirming the existence of life outside of our 
planet will be unprecedented in scientific history. Finding 
extraterrestrial microorganisms (whether fossil or extant) would 
provide the most direct evidence of life. Given planetary protection 
concerns, we are more likely to sample fossil microorganisms, but the 
biogenicity of ancient terrestrial microfossils is greatly debated 
owing to often poor preservation. Thus, other biosignatures are 
typically required to establish the biogenicity of putative ancient 
microfossils and other microbial structures. By developing additional 
novel biosignatures and combining multiple techniques for establishing 
biogenicity, we can find evidence of life that is more convincing. Such 
techniques would provide invaluable tools for the search for 
extraterrestrial life. This session seeks to highlight work being done 
to develop novel biosignatures or to use established biosignatures to 
search for new evidence of early life on Earth and/or past or present 
life on Mars.

ASTROBIOLOGY SCIENCE CONFERENCE SESSION: BIOSIGNATURE DETECTION 
ON MARS - WHERE, WHAT, WHEN, WHY and HOW?

http://www.hou.usra.edu/meetings/abscicon2017 

Abstracts due: January 18, 2017
Meeting: April 24-28, Mesa AZ 

Finding evidence of extant life on Mars would be a watershed event. 
We have evidence on Mars for many environments that may have been 
habitable in the past, but the range of possible biogeochemistries 
those environments allow, the co-evolution of those environments 
with life, the specific niches most likely to host 
detectable biosignatures, and the path forward to explore those 
environments are still key unknowns. We invite contributions that:

(1) explore the succession of physical and environmental processes 
    and their combination on Early Mars, 
(2) evaluate (ideally quantitatively!) the geo/environmental 
    context of potential sites for biological exploration of Mars, 
(3) detail the most promising locations, instrument concepts, and 
    strategies for investigating these ecosystems, 
(4) define the relevant objects, substances or patterns that could 
    serve as definitive biosignatures for martian life, and 
(5) investigate metabolisms, survival strategies, and energy sources 
    that may be relevant to the search for biosignatures on Mars.

TITAN THROUGH TIME 4

NASA GSFC, April 3-5th 2017

We are pleased to announce that the 4th workshop on "Titan Through 
Time: Titan's Formation, Evolution and Fate" will be held at NASA 
Goddard Space Flight Center, April 3-5th 2017. As in previous years, 
the 2 1/2 day workshop will feature a mixture of invited review talks, 
as well as contributed talks and posters. The timing of this workshop 
is especially apt, coinciding with the last year of the Cassini 
mission, and an era when new missions to Titan are envisaged for the 
"Ocean Worlds" initiative of the New Frontiers program.

Invited speakers and meeting details can be found at:

EUROPLANET VESPA WORKSHOP 2ND ANNOUNCEMENT: PLANETARY MAPPING AND 
VIRTUAL OBSERVATORY

https://epn-vespa.github.io/mapping2017/

Abstract deadline: 20th February 2017

Mapping of planetary surfaces is well established with both practice 
and standards. Neighboring areas, from interiors to magnetospheres are 
suitable for cross-disciplinary science using the Virtual Observatory 
(VO) approach and tools, specifically targeting Planetary Science 
(VESPA). The workshop aims at bringing together the geologic, 
geospatial and VO communities for bringing forward knowledge, tools 
and standards for mapping the Solar System.

FULLY-FUNDED 3 YEAR PHD STUDENTSHIP ON SURFACE WIND MODELLING ON MARS

Most efforts to date have focussed on Mars atmospheric circulation at 
very large scales, with Global Climate Models being the primary 
guidance. The temporal and spatial scales these models are operating at 
are good first principles in understanding atmospheric-surface 
interactions - however, they are much too coarse when we are trying to 
comprehend how surface landforms such as dunes are (or have been) 
moulded into modern forms. Understanding aeolian processes must be 
approached at a spatial scale of much less than the length of a dune 
to properly assess for example patterns of dune evolution.

This fully funded 3-year PhD studentship, based between Ulster 
University (N. Ireland) and the Carl Sagan Centre (USA) will use 
several state-of-the-art numerical atmospheric modelling tools, 
including a Mars GCM, a regional Mars mesoscale climate model, and a 
computational fluid dynamics model. Geospatial and geomorphic analysis 
of relevant spacecraft imagery and other observational data will also 
be used to constrain and validate modelling results.

TOWN HALLS TO DISCUSS EUROPA LANDER SDT REPORT
 
NASA is currently conducting a pre-phase A study of a Europa lander 
mission concept with the primary goal of searching for evidence of 
biomarkers and/or extant life on Europa. The SDT report will be 
released in late January, and NASA and the SDT are eager to hear 
feedback from the science community on the science content and 
implementation for the mission concept. To that end, NASA will host 
interactive town halls at LPSC and AbSciCon to discuss the SDT report.  
The purpose of these town halls is to provide an extended opportunity 
to communicate the science content of the report to the scientific 
community and, equally importantly, to engage in constructive 
discussion with the scientific community. The workshops will take 
place on the afternoons of Sunday, March 19, for LPSC and Sunday, 
April 23, for AbSciCon. For questions please contact Dr. Curt Niebur 
at curt.niebur@nasa.gov.

[NASA] ROSES-16 IGHAPS MOVING TO ROSES-2017

C.26 Instruments For Gondola For High-Altitude Planetary Science 
(IGHAPS) will not be solicited in ROSES-2016 but will be solicited as 
part of ROSES-2017.

NASA's Planetary Science Division has begun development of the 
stratospheric balloon-borne platform Gondola for High-Altitude 
Planetary Science (GHAPS) intended for use by the broad science 
community. The GHAPS platform will host a 1-meter telescope and is
designed to fly a minimum of five missions from any of the six Balloon 
Program Office (BPO) launch locations, with minimal refurbishment 
costs between flights. The purpose is to produce significant science 
returns through observations in the 300 nm to 5 um range and possibly 
beyond. As a stratospheric balloon platform flying above 99.5 percent 
of the atmosphere, GHAPS offers access to wavelengths not possible 
from the ground or current space assets. Advances in balloon system 
technology promise long duration flights with day-night cycles. GHAPS 
will provide competed guest observer access through the peer review 
process, allowing the broader science community to accomplish 
compelling planetary science using this platform.

Questions regarding this program element maybe directed to both 
Rob Landis at rob.r.landis@nasa.gov and Kelly Fast at
kelly.e.fast@nasa.gov.
