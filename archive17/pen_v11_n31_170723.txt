[NASA] HQ VACANCY ANNOUNCEMENT - PLANETARY PROTECTION OFFICER

NASA has posted a position in the Office of Safety and Mission 
Assurance for Planetary Protection. It has a very short response time, 
with applications due by August 14, 2017. This position is now assigned 
to Office of Safety and Mission Assurance for Planetary Protection. 
Planetary protection is concerned with the avoidance of organic-
constituent and biological contamination in human and robotic space 
exploration. NASA maintains policies for planetary protection 
applicable to all space flight missions that may intentionally or
unintentionally carry Earth organisms and organic constituents to the 
planets or other solar system bodies, and any mission employing 
spacecraft, which are intended to return to Earth and its biosphere 
with samples from extraterrestrial targets of exploration. 

The initial appointment will be for 3 years, with the possibility of 
extending for an additional 2 years. This may be converted to a
permanent position without further competition.

NOTE: This announcement is open to U.S. citizens and U.S. nationals

For additional information regarding the position, as well as 
qualifying and application procedures, please review the complete 
announcement at:

AGU SESSION 22335: POLARIMETRY AS AN INVALUABLE TOOL TO STUDY THE SOLAR 
SYSTEM AND BEYOND (P033)

Polarimetry is a powerful observing tool and modeling technique, 
providing information about astronomical objects that cannot be 
obtained by traditional photometric/spectroscopic observations. 
Applications include characterization of solar system objects (Sun, 
Earth, planetary atmospheres, aurorae, comets, asteroids, planetary 
satellites/ring systems, dust, etc.) to the detection of exoplanets and 
identification of biological markers in search of habitability. 
Innovative developments in vector radiative transfer theory, laboratory 
measurements, and the increasing significance of non-sphericity effects 
on retrieval efforts showcase the importance of polarimetric 
exploration of the solar system and other planetary systems. This 
session is open to papers about observations of solar system bodies, 
theoretical or experimental investigations, instrumental developments 
ground-based facilities or onboard future space missions.

AGU SESSION 23844: PRESENT-DAY LANDSCAPE EVOLUTION ON MARS (P034)

Long-lived robotic missions have documented many active surface 
processes on Mars, including slope, impact, aeolian, and polar 
processes. These data are now producing insights into landscape 
evolution over longer timescales. Examples include formation of complex 
gullied slopes, carbon-dioxide-driven erosion of south polar terrains 
(including "spiders"), dune field evolution and implications for 
erosion of layered sediments, steep polar scarps with seasonal 
avalanches, and new impact events causing dust avalanches. Of special 
interest due to the possible role of water are recurring slope 
lineae (RSL), with characteristic associated morphologies such as small 
gullies or channels, sandy fans, and slumps. There are also better 
constraints on the rates of other processes, such as ice sublimation 
and glacial flow in the middle latitudes and tectonic activity. Rovers 
and landers provide important in situ measurements supporting orbital 
monitoring. We invite submissions documenting active surface change or 
assessing current landscape evolution on longer timescales.    

Abstract deadline: August 2, 2017

AGU SESSION 25433: CONNECTING CRYOSPHERES ON EARTH AND BEYOND
- GEOLOGICAL & CHEMICAL PROCESSES ON ICY SURFACES (P008)

This session will focus on the physical and chemical processes 
affecting icy surfaces on the Earth and on other worlds, with a 
particular focus on the icy satellites of the outer Solar System. What 
geologic processes take place on the surfaces of icy worlds such as 
Europa and Enceladus, and what can we learn from appropriate 
terrestrial analogs? What balance of external (sunlight, radiation) 
and internal (convection, heating) processes affect and determine the 
morphology and appearance of icy surfaces? This session will bring 
together theoretical and laboratory work with remote sensing 
observations of icy Solar System bodies, and field work at terrestrial 
analog cryosphere locations. A particular focus will be on 
understanding surface / subsurface material exchange, and how processes 
that affect the top surface layer (the "remote sensing layer") continue 
into the subsurface.

AGU SESSION 26453: FUTURE LUNAR EXPLORATION ENABLED BY RECENT MISSION
DATA AND SCIENCE (P015)

A vast science data set has been amassed from recent orbital missions, 
such as LRO and GRAIL, studying the lunar surface and environment. The 
Moon has numerous resources readily available that can enable and 
sustain the exploration of deep space, specifically; volatiles near 
the lunar poles, minerals that may be mined, and hydrogen and oxygen 
that could be extracted. The challenge is to use the available 
scientific data to evaluate these resources for in-situ resource 
utilization. We can also exploit the mission data archive and new 
science results to locate resources, identify nearby landing sites, 
and plan operations, taking into account surface properties at various 
scales. We solicit abstracts that use data or science results from 
recent lunar missions to enable or plan future lunar exploration These 
results might develop new techniques and tools to locate resources 
based on multiple data sets or maximize mission science return.

We encourage submission from researchers and explorers from industry, 
academia and government agencies that are studying future lunar mission 
to describe how the existing data set is being used in innovated ways 
for decisions, plans and optimization.

AGU SESSION 26566: PROBING PLANETARY INTERIORS BEYOND EARTH - EVOLUTION
THORUGH TIME AND SPACE (DI014)

We invite all Earth, Exoplanet and Planetary scientists to submit an 
abstract (deadline August 2, 2017) to our session at the AGU Fall 
Meeting 2017 in New Orleans. 

https://agu.confex.com/agu/fm17/preliminaryview.cgi/Session26566

The compositional diversity of planets in our Solar System and 
predicted to exist in exoplanets represents a new frontier in geologic 
science. The mineralogy, dynamics and structure of these bodies may be 
wholly different from the Earth and present exciting challenges for 
observers, experimentalists and modelers alike. In this session we 
would like to address the effects of planetary composition on 
planetary evolution. We welcome abstracts exploring the compositional 
diversity of bodies, planetary accretion, mineral phase-equilibria and 
physical properties, interior dynamics, and surface/mantle 
interactions. We welcome novel observational approaches for determining 
planetary interior structure and composition as well as efforts to 
model and/or experimentally explore the consequences of potential 
variability of planetary interiors.
