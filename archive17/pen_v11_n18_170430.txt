LLOYD V. BERKNER SPACE POLICY INTERNSHIPS AUTUMN 2017

The goal of the Lloyd V. Berkner Space Policy Internship is to provide
promising undergraduate and graduate students with the opportunity to
work in the area of civil space research policy in the nation's
capital, under the aegis of the National Academies of Sciences,
Engineering, and Medicine's Space Science Board. The autumn program is
open to undergraduate and graduate students. The deadline for
applications is 2 June. Candidate(s) selected for will be contacted no
later than 7 July. Additional information about the program, including
application procedure, can be found at:

SMALL BODIES PLANETARY ASTRONOMY PYTHON PACKAGE

We are proposing a dedicated Python package for use in small bodies
planetary astronomy (asteroids and comets). The idea is to include
well-tested routines that are widely used in our field to prevent
people from re-inventing the wheel time and again. The goal would be to
produce a package that will eventually be added as an Astropy
affiliated package, meeting all of their high-level standards and
building upon existing functionality.

We would like to know from you, as a potential user, what features you
would be interested in. Also, if you are interested in contributing,
either by doing actual Python programming for this package or simply
contributing existing code (Python or any other common language, your
contribution will be properly acknowledged), please let us know.

We created a google form for you to provide us feedback:

PLANETARY GEOMORPHOLOGY 'IMAGE OF THE MONTH'

The May image of the month is now available at the IAG's Planetary
Geomorphology web page:

This month's topic is "Cryovolcanic flows on Ceres". Contributed by Dr.
Katrin Krohn, German Aerospace Center, Institute of Planetary Research.

BUILDING NEW WORLDS - NOW ACCEPTING REGISTRATION APPLICATIONS

Accretion: Building New Worlds is the first topical conference of
LPI's "The First Billion Years" initiative.

http://www.lpi.usra.edu/first-billion-years/ 

The conference will focus on processes of star formation and
circumstellar disks that lead to planetary systems with both
silicate-rich and volatile-rich planetary bodies. These planetary
bodies and their subsequent evolutions provide the basis for habitable
environments and for the origin of life as we know it. The goal of this
topical conference is to integrate the disparate stories of planetary
accretion, both physical and chemical, into a consistent (although
understandably incomplete) whole. The list of invited speakers can be
found on the conference website.

There is no registration fee, but registration is mandatory. 

Due to limited seating, priority will be given to people who submit
abstracts selected for presentation. Because student participation is
strongly encouraged, second priority will be given to undergraduate and
graduate students and early career researchers who apply to attend
(abstract submission is NOT a requirement for attendance for
participants in this category). Remaining seats will be assigned on a
first-come, first-served basis according to the date of application.

Register deadline: June 15, 2017 
Abstract deadline: June 1, 2017

MARS RECONNAISSANCE ORBITER CRISM MTRDR AND TER RELEASE 6

PDS Announces the Sixth Release of Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter CRISM
Targeted Empirical Data Record (TER) and Map-projected Targeted Reduced
Data Record (MTRDR) products, at:

http://pds-geosciences.wustl.edu/missions/mro/crism.htm

This release fills in data from June 12, 2007, through June 23, 2008.
TER products are image cubes derived from CRISM hyperspectral targeted
observations, post-processed to standardize the illumination and
observations geometry and remove atmospheric gas absorptions and
instrument artifacts. MTRDRs are the same data map-projected using
terrain models of the Martian surface. The next TER/MTRDR release is
scheduled for August 1, 2017.

PROPOSAL OF NEW BOOK ON MARTIAN VOLCANISM

Dear colleagues,

I'm putting together a proposal for a new specific book on Martian
volcanism. I think that time has come for such a book, particularly
after the latest discoveries (i.e. volcanic alignments, new volcanic
centers in the southern hemisphere, links between volcanism and
southern giant impact, tridymite at Gale, and much more). 

I have some people who already joined this project but I want to
enlarge the number of authors in order to have a final product as much
shared as possible within the planetary community. This is a wonderful
opportunity for everyone to contribute with a chapter or more. 

So please send me a message (either giovanni.leone@erdw.ethz.ch or
giovanni.leone@tin.it) with your expression of interest and title(s) of
chapter(s) that you are willing to contribute. Of course, I'll be happy
to answer all your questions via email. The deadline for the expression
of interest is May 31, 2017.

Kind regards

Leone Giovanni

EPSC 2017 SESSION OPS4/TP8.2: PLANETARY AEROSOLS AND CLOUDS SESSION

Dear Colleagues,

European Planetary Science Congress 2017 
Riga, Latvia, 
17-22 September 2017
Abstract deadline: May 3!

We invite you to submit abstracts to our (co-organized) session
OPS4/TP8.2 "Aerosols and clouds in planetary atmospheres"!

http://meetingorganizer.copernicus.org/EPSC2017/session/26063

Atmospheric aerosols and cloud particles are found in every atmosphere
of the solar system and in exoplanets. Depending on their size, shape,
chemical composition, latent heat, and distribution, their effect on
the radiation budget varies drastically and is difficult to predict.
When organic, aerosols also carry a strong prebiotic interest
reinforced by the presence of heavy atoms such as nitrogen, oxygen or
sulfur.

The aim of the session is to gather presentations on these complex
objects for both terrestrial and giant planet atmospheres, including
the special case of Titan's hazy atmosphere. All research aspects from
their production and evolution processes, their observation/detection,
to their fate and atmospheric impact are welcomed, including laboratory
investigations and modeling.

The ambition of the session is a review effort beginning in our solar
system, and which would be valuable to further investigate atmospheric
aerosols in exoplanetary systems.

With best regards,
Nathalie Carrasco, Panayotis Lavvas, Anni Maattanen

EPSC 2017 SESSION TP5/OPS5/SB14: PLANETARY GEOMORPHOLOGY SESSION
 
This session invites research on past and present processes and
landforms on planetary surfaces, including moons, asteroids and comets.

The session scope encompasses all aspects of geomorphology, both
exogenic and endogenic. We particularly encourage contributions on
Earth-analogue studies, recent Mars and results from the multitude of
new high-resolution data from missions to objects never seen before
(e.g., Rosetta, New Horizons). This session aims to represent the new
frontiers of geomorphology on Earth and beyond.

EPSC 2017 SESSION TP4 : MARS INTERIOR AND SURFACE SESSION
 
This session welcomes all presentations on Mars' interior and surface
processes. The aim of this session is to bring together disciplines as
various as geology, geomorphology, geophysics, mineralogy, glaciology,
and chemistry. We welcome presentations on either present or past Mars
processes, either pure Mars science or comparative planetology with the
Earth, either observations or modeling or laboratory experiments (or
any combination of those). New results on Mars science obtained from
recent in situ and orbital measurements are particularly encouraged, as
well as prospective science for the preparation of future missions to
be exploring Mars (InSight, ExoMars, Rover 2020).
