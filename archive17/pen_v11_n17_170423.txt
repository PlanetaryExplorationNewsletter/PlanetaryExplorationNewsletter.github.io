ROADMAPS TO OCEAN WORLDS (ROW) TOWNHALL AT ABSCICON

The Roadmaps to Ocean Worlds (ROW) team was chartered by OPAG to 
identify science objectives for Ocean Worlds and to design a roadmap 
(or roadmaps) to explore these worlds to address the identified science 
objectives. We will be holding a ROW townhall at AbSciCon (Monday, 
April 24, 12:15-1:15PM) to share our progress and allow for 
astrobiology community input. We hope to see you there!

LUNAR AND SMALL BODIES GRADUATE CONFERENCE 2017 

Abstract Subsmission Deadline: June 2

Registration is now open for the 8th Annual Lunar and Small Bodies 
Graduate Conference (LunGradCon 2017) to be held on Monday, July 17, 
2017 at the NASA Ames Research Center, preceding the NASA Exploration 
Science Forum (ESF, July 18-20). With the expanded interests of the 
Solar System Exploration Research Virtual Institute (SSERVI), the 
scope of this year's LunGradCon includes both lunar and small body 
science. LunGradCon provides an opportunity for grad students and 
early-career postdocs to present their research on lunar and small 
body science in a low-stress, friendly environment, being critiqued 
only by their peers. In addition to oral presentations, the conference 
presents opportunities for professional development and networking with 
fellow grad students and postdocs, as well as senior members of SSERVI. 
A limited amount of funding will be provided for travel and lodging 
costs. The deadline for registration and abstract submission is June 2, 
2016, 11:59 PM PDT. Note the abstract deadline for ESF is April 19.

PH.D. OPPORTUNITY IN MARTIAN GEOCHEMISTRY

Wesleyan University has funding for a student to complete a Ph.D. in 
the Department of Chemistry with a Concentration in Planetary Science.
The program of study will be tailored to include a relevant geoscience 
curriculum. The proposed project is to create a series of Mars 
analogue brines and precipitate them under terrestrial and martian 
conditions in a Mars chamber. Visible - near-infrared spectra of the 
precipitates will then be compared to similar data collected in Mars 
orbit. The research will be under the tutelage of Prof. Gilmore in the 
Dept. of Earth and Environmental Sciences. The opening is available for 
Fall of 2017. Please apply to the Chemistry Department at: 

http://www.wesleyan.edu/grad/  

Applications will be reviewed as they are received. More information 
about Planetary Sciences at Wesleyan may be found at:

Please direct all inquiries to: 

Prof. Martha Gilmore

LUNAR RECONNAISSANCE ORBITER DIVINER GCPS

The Diviner Lunar Radiometer Experiment onboard the Lunar 
Reconnaissance Orbiter has been acquiring solar reflectance and 
mid-infrared radiance measurements of the lunar surface nearly 
continuously since July 2009. All nadir-pointing observations acquired 
over the first 5.5 years of the mission, approximately a quarter 
trillion calibrated radiance measurements, have been compiled into a 
0.5 degree resolution global data set with a 0.25 hour local time 
resolution. This provides a coarse diurnal temperature cycle for each 
map pixel location. These Global Cumulative Products (GCPs) have been 
released as a new Diviner data set on the NASA Planetary Data System 
Geosciences Node

http://pds-geosciences.wustl.edu/lro/diviner.htm

This data set significantly lowers the level of effort for data 
users to incorporate Diviner results into their research or 
presentations. Maps generated with this data set provide a global 
perspective of the Moon's surface energy balance. Further details of 
the data set and how it can be applied to conduct lunar science can 
be found in Williams et al (2017), The global surface temperatures of 
the Moon as measured by the Diviner Lunar Radiometer Experiment, 
Icarus, 283, 300-325, and will be presented at the 3rd Planetary Data 
Workshop occurring June 12-15 in Flagstaff, AZ.

NASA FRONTIER DEVELOPMENT LAB CALL FOR APPLICANTS

NASA Frontier Development Lab (FDL) has announced its 2017 challenges 
and opened the application process for participants. 

FDL is looking for planetary scientists and computer or data 
scientists with hands-on skills in machine learning, DNNs and other 
algorithmic approaches.

Applicants must have a masters, doctorate or post-doc level of 
understanding in this year's problem areas (Heliophysics, Astronomy, 
Exogeology, Data Science, Software Engineering or Advanced Statistics). 

Hosted by the SETI Institute and NASA Ames, FDL is an artificial 
intelligence accelerator established to tackle knowledge gaps in 
space science by bringing together machine learning expertise and 
physical science specialists. Interdisciplinary teams address 
tightly defined problems and the format encourages rapid iteration 
and prototyping to create outputs with meaningful application.

The 2017 8-week program will accept 24 participants and will run 
June 26 - August 18, 2017.

To learn more about FDL, the 2017 challenge questions, and to apply, 
please visit the FDL website at frontierdevelopmentlab.org

[NASA] NEW INTERNET ADDRESSES FOR PDS DISCIPLINE NODES

Due to evolving government cybersecurity requirements, the Internet 
addresses (URLs) of five Discipline Nodes of the Planetary Data System 
(PDS) have changed. The new URLs are:

Atmospheres (http://pds-atmospheres.nmsu.edu)
Geosciences (http://pds-geosciences.wustl.edu)
Planetary Plasma Interactions (http://pds-ppi.igpp.ucla.edu)
Ring-Moon Systems (http://pds-rings.seti.org)
Small Bodies (https://pds-smallbodies.astro.umd.edu)

The URLs for the Engineering and Management Nodes, and the Navigation 
and Ancillary Information Facility have not changed.

The PDS apologizes for any disruptions that these changes cause.
