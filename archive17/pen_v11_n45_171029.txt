2018 PIERAZZO INTERNATIONAL STUDENT TRAVEL AWARD

Application deadline: 9 PM PST, November 30, 2017

Awards will be announced on or before December 9, 2017

This award is established by the Planetary Science Institute in memory 
of Senior Scientist Betty Pierazzo to support and encourage graduate 
students to build international collaborations and relationships in 
planetary science. Two awards will be made each year, contingent upon 
there being meritorious applications. One will be awarded to a graduate 
student working on his or her Ph.D. at an institution within the U.S. 
This is to support travel to a planetary science related meeting 
(conferences and workshops) outside of the U.S. The second award will 
be to a graduate student working on his or her Ph.D. at an institution 
outside of the U.S. This is to support travel to a planetary science 
related meeting within the U.S. These include general meetings that 
have planetary-focused sessions such as the AGU, GSA, EGU and IAG.

The award will consist of a certificate and up to $2000US.

ICUBESAT 2018 - THE 7TH INTERPLANETARY CUBESAT WORKSHOP

29-30 May 2018
Paris, France

iCubeSat 2018, the 7th Interplanetary CubeSat Workshop, will address
the technical challenges, opportunities, and practicalities of
interplanetary space exploration with CubeSats. The workshop provides
a unique environment for open wide ranging practical collaboration
between academic researchers, industry professionals, policy makers
and students developing this new and rapidly growing field. The full
call for papers and presentations from previous workshops at Caltech,
Cornell, Imperial, MIT, Oxford and Cambridge can be found at:

http://www.iCubeSat.org

Keywords: CubeSat, Interplanetary, Space Science, iCubeSat

Presentations from the 2017 workshop at Cambridge may be seen at:

PLANETARY LASER ALTIMETRY POSITION

Applications are invited for a position at NASA's Goddard Space Flight 
Center in the Planetary Geology, Geophysics and Geochemistry 
Laboratory. We are looking for someone with demonstrated capability in 
interpretation of planetary laser altimetry and radiometry data in 
areas such as characterization of planetary surface properties, 
instrument performance, and measurement accuracy for spaceflight 
altimeters. Demonstrated expertise in developing innovative approaches 
that combine laser altimetry ranges with stereo imaging is required. 
Previous experience in development, implementation, planning, and 
interpretation of new operation modes for flight instruments, 
leveraging sophisticated modeling tools such as illumination modeling 
algorithms, is required. The incumbent will develop new techniques for 
extracting quantitative ranging and ancillary information acquired by 
laser altimeters. The incumbent is expected to participate in the 
development of new and advanced approaches to laser altimetry 
instrumentation and acquisition of surface topography for the planets, 
Moon, asteroids and satellites.

GLOBAL EXPLORATION ROADMAP V3.0 WORKSHOP

Registration has opened for NASA's upcoming virtual workshop on the 
Global Exploration Roadmap, taking place Nov. 29 and 30, 2017. The 
workshop will be primarily virtual, but limited seating is available 
for onsite attendance at the Solar System Exploration Research Virtual 
Institute, located at NASA's Ames Research Center in Moffett Field, 
California. 

We look forward to engaging in meaningful discussions during this 
workshop, when we will provide an overview of updates to the next 
iteration of the Global Exploration Roadmap, a document authored 
jointly by 15 contributing space agencies. We also will share NASA's 
current plans for advancing human missions in deep space, and invite 
our partners and spaceflight industry representatives to comment and 
provide feedback. 

Registration is required for onsite attendance, and encouraged for 
virtual attendance. Virtual participants will have opportunities to 
comment and ask questions during the workshop through an interactive 
web platform. Note that non-U.S. onsite attendees must submit an 
International Visitor form by Oct. 27. The form will be provided via 
email for those non-U.S. citizens.

A complete workshop agenda will be posted to the same webpage closer to 
the workshop dates.
