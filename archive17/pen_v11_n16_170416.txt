9TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON GEOMORPHOLOGY

Location: Vigyan Bhawan, New Delhi

Abstracts Due: April 30, 2017
Earlybird Registration Closes: July 31, 2017

S32 Planetary Geomorphology (IAG-WG)
Chairs: Vic Baker, Susan Conway and Klaus Kuhn

Unprecedented high spatial, temporal and spectral resolution data from
planetary, lunar, asteroidal and cometary surfaces in our solar system
are being returned by satellites, landers and rovers. These data allow
the identification of a range of active and relict geomorphic processes
that include impact cratering, aeolian, fluvial, lacustrine, deltaic,
volcanic, tectonic, mass wasting, rock breakdown, glacial, periglacial,
and coastal. While the landforms appear similar to those on Earth,
there are issues of equifinality in addition to important differences
in denudation rates, landform scale and indeed the balance of
geomorphic processes. In addition to experimental and modelling
studies, Earth field analogues are often used to better understand
geomorphic processes on other planets. The aim of this session is
to stimulate cross-community discussion of ideas and theories that will
improve our understanding of geomorphic processes in the widest sense
and therefore to better formulate links between process and form on
planetary surfaces.

FUNDAMENTALS OF LIFE IN THE UNIVERSE SYMPOSIUM

Date: Aug 31-Sept 1, 2017
Location: Groningen, The Netherlands
Registration Deadline: April 30, 2017

The newly established Origins Center (http://www.origins-center.nl) in
the Netherlands will be kicked off this summer during the Fundamentals
of Life in the Universe Symposium.

The origin of life, on Earth and elsewhere, is a topic that fascinates
the public, and which is ideally suited to bring together scientists
from various disciplines. On August 31st and September 1st, we organize
a two-day symposium, covering a wide spectrum of topics, from planetary
evolution to the fabrication of synthetic cells.

1. The origin of the Earth and of life
2. Predicting the evolution of life
3. Building and directing life from molecule to biosphere
4. Life in extraterrestrial environments
5. Emergence and bridging of temporal and spatial scales

Besides invited talks, the conference includes a keynote lecture by Ben
Feringa (2016 Nobel laureate in chemistry), and a public lecture by
Charley Lineweaver. We invite participants from the fields including
chemistry, geosciences, biology, astronomy, and physics to submit
abstracts for our poster sessions. The program also includes
opportunities for cross-disciplinary networking.

3RD PLANETARY DATA WORKSHOP

The 3rd Planetary Data Workshop will be conducted June 12-15, 2017 at
the High Country Conference Center, 201 West Butler Avenue, Flagstaff,
Arizona 86001. 

https://www.hou.usra.edu/meetings/planetdata2017/

This workshop will cover a wide variety of planetary data topics,
including current mission data availability, online data access tools
and capabilities, new data visualization tools and data user training,
GIS methods and software, and an introduction to PDS4 concepts and
software. The agenda will be available at the meeting Web site by April
25, 2017.

This year we're proud to co-host the annual NASA Planetary Geologic
Mappers (PGM) Meeting. The PGM annual meeting primarily supports
NASA-funded principal investigators who are currently developing
geological map products to discuss the status of mapping tasks and to
obtain guidance for the map publication process. Other scientists and
students interested in planetary cartography, geological mapping, and
map-related topical science are also encouraged to attend.

PDS4 DATA ARCHIVING TRAINING SESSION AT THE 3RD PLANETARY DATA WORKSHOP

The current format standard for archiving data with the NASA Planetary
Data System (PDS) is called PDS4. This standard has been required for
data archives from NASA-funded missions and for small data archives
since 2011. There will be a PDS4 archiving training event scheduled for
June 14, 2017 here in Flagstaff, in association with the 3rd Planetary
Data Workshop. See:

https://www.hou.usra.edu/meetings/planetdata2017

This 1-day session will include distribution of a virtual box with
archiving software, examples and documentation. Topics will include an
introduction to PDS4 concepts and vocabulary and hands-on training on
how to design a bundle and collections and on development of basic
product labels for a simple table and image file. Experienced PDS
staff will be on-hand to answer questions and offer help as needed. 
For more information about PDS4, please refer to information on and
linked to the NASA PDS4 site:

THREE PHD STUDENT POSITIONS IN SPACE PLASMA PHYSICS

The Solar System Physics and Space Technology research programme at the
Swedish Institute of Space Physics (IRF) in Kiruna invites applications
for PhD student positions in experimental space plasma physics. The
projects focus on data analysis from the ESA cometary mission Rosetta
and on development of instruments for studies of the Jovian system on
the ESA mission to Jupiter, JUICE.

EUROPA LANDER TOWN HALL AT LPSC AND ABSCICON
 
As a reminder, NASA will host a town hall at AbSciCon to discuss the
Europa lander SDT report. The town hall is intended to provide an
extended opportunity to communicate the science content of the report
to the scientific community and, equally importantly, to engage in
constructive discussion with the scientific community. The event will
be held in the Starlight room at AbSciCon and will begin at 12:30 pm
mountain time (Phoenix local time). Webex information for the town
hall is given below. For questions please contact Dr. Curt Niebur at
curt.niebur@nasa.gov.

The SDT report for the pre-Phase A study of a Europa lander mission is
