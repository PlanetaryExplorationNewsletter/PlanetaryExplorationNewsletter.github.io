NOTICE OF FUTURE CALL FOR NASA KECK KEY STRATEGIC MISSION SUPPORT
PROGRAMS

NASA is a partner in the two 10-m telescopes of the William M. Keck
Observatory. Access to NASA's share of this time on the Keck telescopes
(~90 nights/year) is available to all astronomers resident at US
institutions. Proposals are submitted biannually to the NASA Exoplanet
Science Institute (NExScI). Observing time is awarded on the basis of
scientific merit and the degree to which the proposed program supports
NASA missions and/or strategic goals.

NASA sets aside 1/3 of its allocation for Key Strategic Mission Support
programs (KSMS). In the 2016A semester, NASA selected three KSMS
projects for a 2 year duration. All three programs end at the
completion of the 2017B semester.

NASA is planning to release a new call for KSMS projects for the 2018A
semester. Details of the opportunity and the proposal process will be
announced in early in August 2017 with non-binding notices of intent
due shortly thereafter. Proposals for the 2018A semester will be due on
September 14, 2017. A KSMS project is typically multi-semester (10-60
nights, up to three years). The KSMS opportunity will be open for all
topics/missions in astrophysics and planetary science.

PHD POSITION AT DLR IN BERLIN

PhD position on experimental investigation of asteroid and comet
regolith

The Institute of Planetary Research at the German Aerospace Center
(DLR) in Berlin invites applications for a PhD position within the
framework of a DLR junior research group. The group works on the
interpretation of surface features related to volatile content on
asteroids and comets via an interdisciplinary approach including
cartographic preparations, geologic analysis of remote sensing data of
space missions as well as experimental and numerical simulations. The
successful candidate will work on the implementation and interpretation
of experiments simulating volatile related regolith properties and
processes on asteroids and comets. The evaluation of the experimental
results will encompass correlation with data from relevant space
missions including the Rosetta and Dawn missions.

Candidates should hold a master degree in physics or closely related
field.

For more information about the post and the application procedure
please visit:

http://www.dlr.de/dlr/jobs/en/desktopdefault.aspx/tabid-10596/1003_read

Interested candidates should send a letter of motivation stating their
research interests and relevant experience, a CV, copies of grade
transcripts/diplomas, and 1-2 letters of recommendation. Applications
should be submitted via the link above.

ABSTRACT DEADLINE APPROACHING!

Accretion: Building New Worlds Conference at the Lunar and Planetary
Institute. ABSTRACT DEADLINE APPROACHING!
August 15-18, 2017, Houston TX

https://www.hou.usra.edu/meetings/accretion2017/

The Accretion Conference will focus on processes that lead to
planetary systems, like our own, with silicate-rich and volatile-rich
planetary bodies. These bodies and their subsequent evolutions provide
the bases for habitable environments and for the origin of life as we
know it. The goal of this topical conference is to integrate the
disparate stories of planetary accretion, both physical and chemical,
into a consistent (although understandably incomplete) whole.

The Accretion conference will encompass the formation and aggregation
of dust and gas to embryos to planets, and include astronomical
observations of circumstellar disks, chemical and physical data from
the solar system materials (meteorites, etc.), and simulations of
physical and chemical processes of accretion. All relevant data and
ideas are welcome.

students, seek involvement with spacecraft missions if appropriate, and
participate with NASA and the science community in review panels,
analysis and advisory groups, etc. We are particularly interested in
hearing from prospective candidates who have expertise beyond that of
our existing staff scientists.
 
For more information about the position, please contact the LPI
Director, Dr. Louise Prockter at prockter@lpi.usra.edu. Applicants

EUROPA LANDER INSTRUMENT PEA

Special OPAG Steering Committee Finding, May 26, 2017

For full postion, see: 

http://www.lpi.usra.edu/opag/

NASA released "Community Announcement Regarding Europa Lander
Instrument Investigation Program Element Appendix" on May 17, 2017,
which included a surprising statement prohibiting JPL from submitting
proposals to this opportunity. The OPAG steering committee is concerned
about this potential exclusion of JPL scientists and instrument
technology experts who have spent decades preparing for a life-
detection mission such as Europa Lander. We urge NASA to proceed in a
way that does not increase risk to Europa Lander science by excluding
key capabilities. We note that NASA has funded much highly relevant
work at JPL via R&A programs and the Astrobiology Institute, and
instrument technology development via MatISSE, PICASSO, COLDtech, and
other programs. Excluding the knowledge gained from such efforts would
be counterproductive.

BOOK: ATMOSPHERIC EVOLUTION ON INHABITED AND LIFELESS WORLDS
 
Written by David Catling and Jim Kasting, two well-known planetary
scientists, this brand new text explains the physical and chemical
principles of atmospheric evolution and planetary atmospheres, in the
context of how atmospheric composition and climate determine a planet's
habitability. The authors survey our current understanding of the
atmospheric evolution and climate on Earth, on other rocky planets
within our Solar System, and on exoplanets. This interdisciplinary text
is an invaluable resource for graduate-level students and researchers
working across the fields of atmospheric science, geochemistry,
planetary science, and astrobiology. More details, including sample
