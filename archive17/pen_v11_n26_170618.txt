SCIENTIFIC PROGRAMMER, UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND

The Small Bodies Node (SBN) of NASA's Planetary Data System, based in 
the Department of Astronomy at the University of Maryland, College 
Park, is seeking a programmer with analytic experience who would work 
with a larger group of planetary scientists and programmers. The ideal 
candidate will also work closely with programmers at the Minor Planet 
Center at the Center for Astrophysics, Cambridge, MA, concerned with 
small body astronomy and orbital calculation. Five years experience is 
required, including some system administration experience or training, 
and with some experience either designing or implementing IT security 
measures in a Linux network environment. A familiarity with relational 
database management is also desired. A Bachelor's or Master's level 
degree in computer science or a related field is prefered, but previous 
work experience will also be considered. Near-term tasks include 
developing a cross-identification database for all bodies represented 
in the archive, overseeing the security plan for the SBN, back-end 
development and user interface development, and reporting to NASA.

To receive full consideration, applications must be submitted by 
August 25, 2017.

PLANETARY AND SPACE SCIENCES (PSS) SPECIAL ISSUE INVITATION: DUST,
ATMOSPHERE AND PLASMA ENVIRONMENT OF THE MOON AND SMALL BODIES

The DAP-2017 workshop was held in Boulder on January 11th-13th. It 
was focused on open science questions, the status and future of our 
supporting modeling and laboratory experimental capabilities, and the 
definition of the required measurements and instrument capabilities 
for future investigations from orbit or landed missions. Contributions 
to the earlier LDAP-2010 and DAP-2012 meetings were published in 
special issues of Planetary and Space Sciences. A similar volume is 
planned to report the contributions to DAP-2017.

In addition to the meeting participants, the editors are soliciting 
contributed papers from the larger lunar, planetary, and space science 
communities that are relevant to the topics discussed during the 
DAP-2017 meeting.  

The deadline for submitting a paper to this special issue is June 30, 
2017.

GSA 2017 SESSION T.199: BASALT WEATHERING ON EARTH AND MARS

We invite you to submit an abstract to our session on "Basalt 
weathering on Earth and Mars" at this year's GSA Annual Meeting in 
Seattle, WA on October 22-25, 2017.

This session explores basalt weathering processes and products under 
various environmental conditions on Earth and Mars. Abstracts are 
solicited on field studies, laboratory simulations, geochemical 
modeling, and/or remote sensing observations.

Please submit your abstract here:

https://gsa.confex.com/gsa/2017AM/top/papers/index.cgi?sessionid=43290

The submission deadline is August 1, 2017.

Conveners:

Melissa S. Rice (Western Washington University)
Leslie L. Baker (University of Idaho)
Michael D. Kraft (Western Washington University)

We look forward to seeing you in Seattle!

[NASA] PDS: LUNAR RECONNAISSANCE ORBITER DATA RELEASE 30

The NASA Planetary Data System is pleased to announce a new delivery of 
Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) data for the following instruments:  
CRaTER, DLRE, LAMP, LEND, LOLA, and LROC. In general, LRO Release 30 
includes data collected between December 15, 2016 and March 14, 2017. 
To access the above data, please visit the following link:  

http://pds.nasa.gov/tools/subscription_service/SS-20170615.shtml

PDS offers two services for searching the LRO archives:

The Planetary Image Atlas at the Imaging Node allows selection of LRO 
data by specific search criteria:

The Lunar Orbital Data Explorer at the Geosciences Node allows 
searching and downloading of LRO data and other lunar orbital data sets 
(Clementine and Lunar Prospector):

ICE GIANT MISSION STUDY RELEASED

A joint NASA-ESA study of potential missions to Uranus and Neptune has 
been released. The study was performed as part of preparations for the 
next Planetary Science Decadal Survey. It identifies the scientific 
questions the next Ice Giant mission should address, and discusses 
various instruments, spacecraft, flight-paths, and technologies that 
could be used. The full study as well as an Executive Summary are 
available at:
