IN MEMORIAM: TOBIAS C. OWEN (1936-2017)
 
It is with real sadness that we report the loss of Tobias (Toby) C. Owen,
who died on March 4, 2017. To quote Dale Cruikshank: 

"Toby was a professor at SUNY Stony Brook for many years, and then at
the University of Hawaii, where he was affiliated until his passing. He
will be remembered as a man of the world, unfailingly generous and
modest, and a great scientist. He inspired all of his many colleagues
with his enthusiasm for all aspects of planetary science, including the
big questions of the origin of the Solar System and of life in the
Universe. Toby received a number of honors in the US and in Europe, and
in 2009, he was awarded the Gerard P. Kuiper Prize of the DPS."

EUROPLANET GRANTS FOR FIELD WORK IN DANAKIL (ETHIOPIA) AND AT IBN
BATTUTA CENTRE (MOROCCO)

A call of the Europlanet Research Infrastructure for field work in
Ethiopia and Morocco is currently active and the proposal must be
received by March 30th at 12:00 CEST. The Europlanet partners IRSPS
(Italy) and Ibn Battuta Centre (Morocco) are organising the activities
in Ethiopia with major objectives the hydrothermal site of Dallol and
other features such as fan-deltas, lakes, salt flats. In Morocco
several sites are available including the ones described in the Ibn
Battuta web page (see below). Other field sites and laboratories for
simulation and samples data are available under this scheme. The
activities in Danakil will be concentrated in a single expedition
scheduled for January 2018, the ones in Morocco can be carried anytime.
Europlanet RI will cover travel, and field work costs. The call is open
to scientists of any nationality.

CALL FOR DWORNIK JUDGES AT LPSC

We need more judges! Please assist in the important task of supporting
excellence in our younger scientists through judging student
presentations at the 48th LPSC, March 20-24, in The Woodlands, Texas.
Contact Sharon Wilson Purdy at purdys@si.edu to sign up.

About the Award: The Dwornik Award was started in 1991 with a generous
endowment by Dr. Stephen E. Dwornik, who wished to encourage U.S.
students to become involved with NASA and planetary science. The Award
consists of a plaque and a monetary award given for outstanding student
presentations (in both poster and oral categories) or a plaque for
honorable mentions (poster and oral) at the annual Lunar and Planetary
Science Conference (LPSC) hosted by the Lunar and Planetary Institute
(LPI). The awards are managed and judged by the Planetary Geology
Division of the Geological Society of America. More information here:

2017 NASA FUNDAMENTAL PHYSICS WORKSHOP

Date: May 31-June 2, 2017
Location: Santa Barbara, CA
Abstract Deadline: April 30, 2017

The workshop will provide a forum for NASA fundamental physics
investigators to present results and discuss research ideas for future
space experimentation with interested international and US colleagues
in the areas of Atomic and Molecular Physics (DAMOP community),
Fundamental Forces and Symmetries, Dusty Plasma Physics, and Condensed
Matter Physics. Specific sessions will be organized to discuss status
and planned science capabilities of the Cold Atom Laboratory slated for
launch in 2017, the Bose-Einstein Condensate Cold Atom Laboratory
(BECCAL) follow-on activity under joint development with Germany (DLR),
including results from the recent DLR MAIUS rocket flight, and
investigation plans by scientists using ESA's Plasma Kristall-4 ISS
facility and CNES' DECLIC-ALI-R ISS facility insert.

During the workshop, NASA/JPL will discuss plans for engaging the
BECCAL U.S. science community through a regular investigator
solicitation and also through the selection of Science Definition Team
members during the BECCAL early formulation activities. Also,
discussions will be held regarding collaborations with NSF and CASIS,
the ISS US National Laboratory manager.

POSTDOC IN GIANT PLANET ATMOSPHERES, UNIVERSITY OF LEICESTER

The Physics and Astronomy Department at the University of Leicester
wishes to appoint a postdoctoral researcher to undertake a programme of
original research in the field of giant planet atmospheric science,
utilising remote sensing data from a range of space- and ground-based
observatories. You will join a planetary science team addressing the
aims of a grant awarded by the European Research Council (ERC) to Dr.
Leigh Fletcher. The appointment will initially be for a period of up to
four years.

The "GIANTCLIMES" programme seeks to study the climates of the four
giant planets over large spans of time, allowing us to investigate
cycles of meteorology, circulation, and chemical processes shaping the
environments on these worlds. Inversions of planetary spectra, from the
ultraviolet to the microwave, will be used to reconstruct these
atmospheres in three dimensions to explore their temporal variability
and the processes coupling different atmospheric regimes. You will
analyse subsets of data from Juno, Cassini, Spitzer and the James Webb
Space Telescope (among others), complemented by observations from
Earth-based facilities. We are therefore particularly interested in
candidates with a background in planetary atmospheres and spectroscopic
modelling techniques, but all applicants with a strong background in
planetary science are encouraged to apply.

Closing date: 5 April 2017

EUROPA LANDER TOWN HALL AT LPSC AND ABSCICON
 
As a reminder, NASA will host a town hall at LPSC to discuss the Europa
lander SDT report. The town hall is intended to provide an extended
opportunity to communicate the science content of the report to the
scientific community and, equally importantly, to engage in
constructive discussion with the scientific community. The event will
be held in the Waterway I ballroom at LPSC and will begin at 12:30 pm
central time. Webex information for the town hall is given below. A
second town hall will take place on the afternoon of Sunday, April 23,
at AbSciCon. For questions please contact Dr. Curt Niebur at
curt.niebur@nasa.gov.

The SDT report for the pre-Phase A study of a Europa lander mission is
available at:

YOUNG SCIENTISTS FOR PLANETARY EXPLORATION AT LPSC

Mark your LPSC agendas! Thursday (March 23) during lunch (12:00 to
1:15), the Young Scientists for Planetary Exploration will hold an open
forum to discuss issues affecting early career scientists: upcoming
opportunities for research and mission involvement, job prospects and
networking, and ways to improve the future of planetary exploration. A
supportive and inclusive environment is paramount to this future.
Although priority will be given to issues concerning younger/early
career scientists, this forum is open to all members of the community.
Bring your lunch and good ideas!

Thursday, 12:00 to 1:15 PM, Waterway 4
