POST-DOCTORAL RESEARCH ASSOCIATE, LOWELL OBSERVATORY

Applications are invited for a postdoctoral position at Lowell 
Observatory to work on the physical characterization of near-Earth 
objects. This position will be supervised by Dr. Nicholas Moskovitz. 
The position is to be split with 80% of the time dedicated to the main 
program and 20% for any other research of the postdoctoral associate's 
choosing. The start date is negotiable, but the preference would be for 
late Summer or early Fall 2017.

The postdoctoral associate will work in collaboration with Dr. 
Moskovitz and other project team members on an ongoing physical 
characterization survey of near-Earth objects. This survey is working 
to build a comprehensive dataset of astrometry, rotational light 
curves, and spectra for hundreds of newly discovered NEOs. In addition 
to assisting with target management and conducting regular (1-2 nights 
per month) observing runs, the postdoctoral associate will be expected 
to take a leading role in the survey's spectroscopic observations, 
reductions, and analysis.

Review of application will begin on 15 March 2017.

EARLY CAREER PARTICIPANT SUPPORT AVAILABLE FOR NASA OUTER PLANETS 
ASSESSMENT GROUP MEETING IN ATLANTA
 
NASA's Outer Planets Assessment Group will provide travel grants for a 
limited number of interested Early Career participants to attend the 
OPAG meeting February 22-23 in Atlanta, GA. OPAG plays a key role in 
sculpting the planetary science community's input into NASA activities 
for outer planets science and exploration. Thus it is critical for
Early Career scientists to attend these meetings both to learn how 
NASA and Planetary Science programs operate and to represent the 
community that will work on OPAG-relevant projects in the coming
decade. Selected individuals will present a poster at the meeting on 
a topic of their choosing. Interested graduate students, postdocs, 
and other Early Career scientists (within 5 years of PhD/MS/BS) should 
submit a one page letter of interest and a CV to 
britneys@eas.gatech.edu by Jan 18, 2017. Recipients will be notified 
by Jan 23. For more information, email Britney Schmidt at the 
address above.

VENUS MODELING WORKSHOP ANNOUNCEMENT

This 3-day workshop is being convened with support from VEXAG in order 
to share knowledge among researchers involved in any aspect of 
modeling the current or historic conditions of Venus. It will be held 
May 9-11, 2017 in Cleveland, OH at the Ohio Aerospace Institute 
adjacent to NASA's Glenn Research Center. Abstract submission is now 
open, and further information can be found at:

CALL FOR ABSTRACTS FOR SYMPOSIUM M13 - AT THE IAPSO-IAMAS-IAGA 
CONFERENCE

Symposium M13 - Comparative Planetary Atmospheres within and beyond 
the Solar System at the IAPSO-IAMAS-IAGA Conference 
Capetown, South Africa
27 August-1 September 2017

Convenor: Sanjay S. Limaye, Feng Tian
Co-Convenors: Athena Coustenis, Christina Plainaki, Christine Hvidberg 
(TBC), Scot Rafkin, Takeshi Imamura (TBC) 

An abundance of new information from spacecraft missions such as 
Cassini, Mars Express, Venus Express, Akatsuki, New Horizons, as well 
as from telescopes on Earth or in orbit around Earth, has been 
obtained about planetary atmospheres in the solar system since the 
last symposium.

Hubble and ground based telescopes have also yielded information about 
atmospheres of exoplanets. Further, numerical modelling studies have 
provided useful results on the present or past composition and 
circulation of these exoplanetary atmospheres. This symposium will 
highlight results on past and present composition, processes and 
regional and global circulations of all planetary atmospheres.

This session will be organized according to gaseous planets and 
those with rocky surfaces.

Abstracts are invited for this symposium. The deadline is 12 March 
2017.

EARLY REGISTRATION ENDS ON JANUARY 31ST FOR THE 2017 HUMANS TO MARS 
SUMMIT 

Join us at the Humans to Mars Summit (H2M) that will be held from 
May 9-11, 2017 at The George Washington University in Washington, DC. 
Early registration ends on January 31st!
 
H2M is an annual Mars exploration conference that addresses the major 
technical, scientific, and policy challenges that need to be overcome 
in order to send humans to Mars by the 2030s. It is the most 
comprehensive conference in the world focused on landing humans on 
Mars, and the 2017 H2M is shaping up to be the biggest H2M yet.
 
Confirmed and tentative speakers already include William Gerstenmaier, 
Penny Boston, Thomas Zurbuchen, Clementine Poidatz (National 
Geographic Series, Mars), Buzz Aldrin, John Grunsfeld, James Green, 
Janet Ivey (Janet's Planet), Stephen Jurczyk, Leonard David, Joe 
Cassady (Aerojet Rocketdyne), and many others... 

Register today at: 

http://h2m.exploremars.org 

Early registration available until January 31st.

METSOC 2017 & WORKSHOP/FIELD TRIP TO SANTA FE IMPACT STRUCTURE

The 80th Annual Meeting of the Meteoritical Society will be July 23-28 
in Santa Fe, New Mexico presented by the Institute of Meteoritics at
at the University of New Mexico. For more information:

http://metsoc2017-santafe.com/

Pre-conference workshop and field trip on Sunday, July 23rd:

http://www.psi.edu/santafe2017

The details on the pre-conference morning workshop and afternoon field
trip to the Santa Fe impact structure are found at the link above. The 
theme of the workshop (9:00-12:00) is "Recognizing the criteria for 
ancient impact structures" and will have several 15-20 minute invited 
talks by Wolf "Uwe" Reimold and others. After lunch on your own, a bus 
will take ~25 workshop participants to see shatter cones and (fault) 
breccias of Santa Fe impact structure. A field guide will be handed out 
to all participants.

There will also be a field trip on Wednesday, July 26th as one of the 
Wednesday options at MetSoc. This Wednesday field trip will focus on 
sediment locations of shocked detrital grains.

The workshop website above will be updated in the spring to include 
sign-up information and soliciting volunteers that want to give a 
workshop talk on ancient impact structures.
