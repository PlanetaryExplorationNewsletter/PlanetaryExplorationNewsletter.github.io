METEORITES - UNDERSTANDING THE ORIGIN OF PLANETODIVERSITY

June 6-8, 2018

This is an international workshop held in the Museum National 
d'Histoire Naturelle, Paris.

The aim of the workshop is to bring together meteorites experts as well 
as astronomers working on star and planetary formation to unravel 
physical processes and timescales of planetary formation and evolution 
within our Solar System and beyond.

The workshop will be the conclusion of the 2017-2018 Meteorite 
temporary exhibit at the MNHN, which will feature more than 300 
specimens of meteorites.

PHD OPPORTUNITIES IN PLANETARY SCIENCE AT CURTIN UNIVERSITY

The growing Planetary Sciences Group at Curtin University in Perth, 
Australia, invites applications for three PhD awards. Curtin University 
has the largest planetary science research program in Australia, 
inclusive of the Desert Fireball Network, and is looking to extend this 
vibrant and diverse team of over 20 staff, postdocs and students with 
new PhD opportunities. Projects include an active involvement with the 
InSight mission, the forthcoming mission to land on Mars in 2018, as 
well as current remote sensing missions operating at Mars. Projects are 
best-suited for students with a science degree (planetary sciences, 
physics, geology, geophysics, chemistry, or astronomy background) with 
some computational experience. Student scholarships and stipends 
provided by ARC and Curtin University.

NASA POSTDOCTORAL FELLOWSHIPS 

Application deadline: March 1, 2018

The NASA Postdoctoral Program offers US and international scientists 
the opportunity to advance their research while contributing to NASA's 
scientific goals. The NPP supports fundamental science, explores the 
undiscovered, promotes intellectual growth, and encourages scientific 
connections.

Selected by a competitive peer-review process, NPP Fellows complete 
one- to three-year Fellowship appointments that advance NASA's 
missions in earth science, heliophysics, planetary science, 
astrophysics, space bioscience, aeronautics and engineering, human 
exploration and space operations, and astrobiology.

Current NPP research opportunities in planetary science can be viewed 
here:

https://npp.usra.edu/opportunities/?filter_keywords=&filter_fields=145

Applicants must have a Ph.D. or equivalent degree in hand before 
beginning the fellowship, but may apply while completing the degree 
requirements. U.S. citizens, Lawful Permanent Residents, and foreign 
nationals eligible for J-1 status as a Research Scholar may apply.

Stipends start at $53,500 per year, with supplements for high 
cost-of-living areas and for certain academic specialties. Financial 
assistance is available for relocation and health insurance, and 
$8,000 per year is provided for professional travel.

LPSC SPECIAL SESSION: CELEBRATING CASSINI

We are pleased to announce a special session at the 2018 LPSC meeting, 
Celebrating Cassini! The Cassini spacecraft's thirteen-year mission in 
the Saturn system, covering nearly half of a Saturn year, has come to 
an end. LPSC is at a perfect time and is a wonderful venue to celebrate 
the remarkable legacy of Cassini with invited and contributed talks and 
posters covering science from the many disciplines of this mission. 
This session will highlight the rings, Titan and the icy moons. The 
session will focus on new results covering the final year of the 
mission, as well as seasonal changes, and inter-instrument and 
inter-body comparisons. And, as we now look to the future, papers 
utilizing Cassini discoveries to contemplate the next steps in the 
Saturn system will be welcome. Abstracts are due Jan 9.

[NASA] NEW POLICY FOR SMD CLASS-D MISSIONS

SMD is issuing a new policy documenting the principles and approach 
that will guide the implementation of Class-D missions under $150M 
lifecycle cost, not including launch vehicles, going forward. This new 
approach is a tailoring/streamlining of how SMD executes space flight 
projects per NPR 8705.4, Risk Classification for NASA Payloads 
(Updated w/change 3); NPR 7120.5, NASA Space Flight Program and Project 
Management Requirements w/Changes 1-15; and the SMD Management 
Handbook. This policy is effective January 1, 2018 for all applicable 
projects that have not reached Key Decision Point-C (KDP-C) as of that 
date.

The full text of the new policy is available: 

https://soma.larc.nasa.gov/standardao/ClassD.html

SMD will be hosting a discussion of the new policy during a town hall 
meeting scheduled for Thursday, December 14 at 6:15pm CST at the 2017 
American Geophysical Union Fall Meeting in New Orleans, LA.

SMD will also host a discussion for interested industry 
representatives at 1:00pm EST on January 3, 2018 at NASA Headquarters 
in Washington, DC. Further information about this meeting will appear 
on the SOMA web page.

A web feature on this topic has also been released at:
