2017 EXOPLANET SUMMER PROGRAM

June 26 - July 21, 2017

http://owl.ucsc.edu/visitors/

The Other Worlds Laboratory (OWL) at the University of California, 
Santa Cruz (UCSC) announces the 2017 Exoplanet Summer Program (ESP). 
Within the program we wish to foster new and existing research 
collaborations by outstanding visitors, with stays of 1 to 4 weeks.

Program: The purpose of the program is to allow visitors to generate 
new ideas, nurture existing research projects and collaborations, 
and foster new ones. There is no theme or focus area - in this 
fast-moving exoplanets field we want the participants to drive the 
discussion and work on areas they feel is most pressing and exciting.
We imagine an ESP program that is modest in terms of planned 
activities, besides a daily coffee and seminar with active 
discussion. Participants can expect access to shared offices on 
campus, discussion common areas, and of course immersion in Santa 
Cruz's natural beauty.

Eligibility: Faculty, researchers, postdocs, and graduate students 
at any level are invited to apply. Funding is limited, so 
participant travel support will range from partial to full.

Deadlines: Applications that are received by January 15th, 
February 15th, and March 15th, 2017, will be reviewed on a rolling 
basis.

ASTROBIOLOGY SCIENCE CONFERENCE SESSION: ASSESSING CERES' PAST AND 
PRESENT HABITABILITY AND RELEVANCE TO OCEAN WORLDS

Abstracts are welcome for the following session planned during the 
Astrobiology Science Conference (AbSciCon 2017) that will take 
place during the week of April 24-28 in Mesa, Arizona. 

Abstracts are due by January 18.

Topic: Assessing Ceres' Past and Present Habitability and Relevance 
to Ocean Worlds

Session Summary: Long before Dawn's rendezvous in 2015 it was 
suspected that Ceres, a dwarf planet and the largest body between 
Mars and Jupiter, may once have harbored liquid water in its deep 
interior and may have been aqueously altered. Observations from 
the Dawn mission have confirmed aqueous alteration on Ceres and 
revealed ocean-derived material on its surface. This session will 
explore Ceres' astrobiological relevance in the light of Dawn's 
observations, new models for Ceres' chemical and physical 
evolution, its present state, and possible exploration strategies.

The Organizers: Julie Castillo-Rogez and Marc Neveu

ASTROBIOLOGY SCIENCE CONFERENCE SESSION: BIOSIGNATURE DETECTION ON 
MARS - WHERE, WHAT, WHEN, WHY and HOW?

http://www.hou.usra.edu/meetings/abscicon2017

Abstracts due January 18, 2017
Meeting April 24-28, Mesa AZ 

Finding evidence of extant life on Mars would be a watershed event. 
We have evidence on Mars for many environments that may have been 
habitable in the past, but the range of possible biogeochemistries 
those environments allow, the co-evolution of those environments 
with life, the specific niches that are most likely to host 
detectable biosignatures, and the path forward to explore those 
environments are still key unknowns. We invite contributions that:

(1) explore the succession of physical and environmental processes 
    and their combination on Early Mars, 
(2) evaluate (ideally quantitatively!) the geo/environmental 
    context of potential sites for biological exploration of Mars, 
(3) detail the most promising locations, instrument concepts, and 
    strategies for investigating these ecosystems, 
(4) define the relevant objects, substances or patterns that could 
    serve as definitive biosignatures for martian life, and 
(5) investigate metabolisms, survival strategies, and energy sources 
    that may be relevant to the search for biosignatures on Mars.

AOGS 2017, SESSION PS15: VOLCANISM AND TECTONISM ACROSS THE SOLAR 
SYSTEM

Singapore in August 6-11, 2017
Abstract submission deadline: 15 February 2017

http://www.asiaoceania.org/aogs2017/public.asp?page=home.htm

The surfaces of the terrestrial planets and their satellites have 
been largely shaped through volcanic and tectonic processes. 
Extreme conditions on outer solar system bodies, such as the 
Jovian and Saturnian satellites, result in different types of 
volcanism and tectonism. Fracturing and faulting processes 
mainly affect minor bodies such as asteroids and small moons, 
where volcanism and tectonism have not played an important role. 
We invite contributions that cover a wide range of topics 
including geomorphology and composition of volcanic deposits, 
edifices, and plumes, volcano-induced deformation and edifice 
growth and collapse to tectonic structures, faulting and 
fracturing processes, crustal stress and strain analysis, 
cryovolcanism, and any study related to planetary endogenic 
processes. Furthermore, studies that relay interactions between 
planetary interiors, surfaces, and atmospheres are welcomed. 
Comparative studies of volcanic or tectonic systems on Earth 
with a strong remote sensing component are encouraged. 

Hope to see you there!

Dr. Anezina Solomonidou (Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Caltech, 
United States)
Dr. Thomas Platz (Max-Planck Institute for Solar System 
Research, Germany)

EARLY CAREER PARTICIPANT SUPPORT AVAILABLE FOR NASA OUTER PLANETS 
ASSESSMENT GROUP MEETING IN ATLANTA

NASA's Outer Planets Assessment Group will provide travel grants for 
a limited number of interested Early Career participants to attend 
the OPAG meeting February 22-23 in Atlanta, GA. OPAG plays a key role 
in sculpting the planetary science community's input into NASA 
activities for outer planets science and exploration. Thus it is 
critical for Early Career scientists to attend these meetings both 
to learn how NASA and Planetary Science programs operate and to 
represent the community that will work on OPAG-relevant projects 
in the coming decade. Selected individuals will present a poster 
at the meeting on a topic of their choosing. Interested graduate 
students, postdocs, and other Early Career scientists (within 5 
years of PhD/MS/BS) should submit a one page letter of interest and 
a CV to britneys@eas.gatech.edu by Jan 18, 2017. Recipients will 
be notified by Jan 23.  

For more information, email Britney Schmidt at the address above.
