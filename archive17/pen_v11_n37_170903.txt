[NASA] ROSES-17: HURRICANE HARVEY CAUSES DELAY OF ROSES DUE DATES

To give more time to proposers who are without power because of 
Hurricane Harvey, the following due dates for ROSES program elements 
have been delayed [planetary programs listed below]:

C.15 Planetary Protection Research has been delayed to September 21, 
2017.

For both C.11 Discovery Data Analysis and C.20 Rosetta Data Analysis 
Program the Step-1 proposal due date is now September 21, 2017 and 
the Step-2 proposal due date is November 21, 2017.

Questions concerning these program elements may be directed to the 
point of contacts listed in the summary table of key information and 
at:

TWO POSTDOCTORAL POSITIONS IN MARS SCIENCE

The Department of Planetology and Habitability at the Centro de 
Astrobiologia (CAB) invites applications for two postdoctoral positions 
to support investigations on the nature of the early Mars environments. 
The successful candidate will work with Dr. Alberto Fairen in the 
ERC-funded Project "icyMARS".

Applicants should have a recent Ph.D. in the field of Planetary 
Science or related discipline, and background in sedimentology of 
ice-covered lakes, or in biology of psychrophilic microorganisms.

The positions, placed in Madrid, would be for one year, with possible 
extension to a second year contingent upon funding availability and 
satisfactory performance. Benefits include working in a young 
enthusiastic team at one of the leading Planetary Sciences institutions 
in Europe, full social benefits according to the Spanish social care 
system, and a very competitive salary.

Applicants should send a letter of interest, a curriculum with a list 
of publications, a brief (maximum two pages) statement of research 
interests, and a list of three references, no later than September 10, 
2017, to Alberto Fairen (agfairen@cab.inta-csic.es).

The starting date is negotiable, but should be no later than Jan 1, 
2018.

SIX POSTDOC POSITIONS IN ORIGINS OF LIFE RESEARCH

The Origins Center is a recent, multidisciplinary and multi-institute, 
Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research NWO funded initiative 
of a large number of top tier scientists in the Netherlands. Over 17 
Dutch universities and research institutes participate in the Center 
that is coordinated by the University of Groningen, the Netherlands.

Within the Center we are now recruiting postdoctoral research fellows 
for five three-year pathfinder projects that together should lay the 
groundwork for a future, far larger research programme which aims at 
game-changing understanding of the origin of life and of life-bearing 
planets, predicting evolution, building and steering life from molecule 
to biosphere, finding extra-terrestrial life and of the mathematical 
concepts needed for bridging large spatial, temporal and organisatorial 
scale differences:

http://www.origins-center.nl/vacancies

Fellowships are available within each of the following five projects:

Developing, testing and operating the Origins Simulator
Identifying factors enabling predictability of evolution
Building and directing life
Modelling planet earth as an exoplanet
Mathematically understanding downward causation

Candidates should have a strong background in astronomy, biophysics, 
chemistry, microbiology, ecology, evolutionary biology, mathematics, 
computational science, molecular biosciences or planetary and 
geosciences, and be able to perform innovative and multidisciplinary 
research.

HE SPACE ROCKETS TO 200 EMPLOYEES

Europe's leading specialist in personnel services for space will
shortly be welcoming its 200th employee, who will work as a planetary
scientist on ESA's BepiColombo project.

This exciting new position is another example of the wide-ranging
support and capabilities that HE Space is able to offer to the European
space sector. HE Space recently won a five year extension of the frame
contract it has with ESA for the supply of manpower services. This was
achieved by out-performing all its rivals in open competition.
