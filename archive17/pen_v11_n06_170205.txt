MARS RECONNAISSANCE ORBITER CRISM MTRDR and TER RELEASE 5

PDS announces the fifth release of Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter CRISM 
Targeted Empirical Data Record (TER) and Map-projected Targeted 
Reduced Data Record (MTRDR) products, at:

http://pds-geosciences.wustl.edu/missions/mro/crism.htm

This release fills in data from Dec. 22, 2006, through July 20, 2008. 
TER products are image cubes derived from CRISM hyperspectral targeted 
observations, post-processed to standardize the illumination and 
observations geometry and remove atmospheric gas absorptions and 
instrument artifacts. MTRDRs are the same data map-projected using 
terrain models of the Martian surface. The next TER/MTRDR release is 
scheduled for May 1, 2017.

PLANETARY GEOMORPHOLOGY 'IMAGE OF THE MONTH'

The February image of the month is now available at the IAG's Planetary 
Geomorphology web page: 

http://planetarygeomorphology.wordpress.com/

This month's topic is "Everything you wanted to know about Martian 
scoria cones, but were afraid to ask...".

Post contributed by Dr. Petr Broz, Institute of Geophysics of the Czech 
Academy of Science.

FINAL ANNOUNCEMENT FOR THE SHOCK METAMORPHISM WORKSHOP

2017 International Workshop on: Shock Metamorphism in Terrestrial and 
Extra-Terrestrial Rocks will be held June 26 - July 2 in Perth, 
Australia, including a field trip to the Wolfe Creek crater in Western 
Australia.

We invite researchers of all backgrounds and interests in studying 
shock effects in geologic media and impact-related processes in the 
solar system for this four-day multi-disciplinary workshop.

Early bird registration is now open and submissions close 1st May 2017.

EXTENSION FOR SUBMISSION DEADLINE FOR ICARUS SPECIAL ISSUE FOR MARS 
POLAR SCIENCE CONFERENCE

As a participant in the recent Sixth Mars Polar Conference, we'd like 
to let you know that we have extended the deadline for papers for the 
Conference Special Issue in the journal Icarus. The new due date is 
1 March. We hope this enables as many of you as possible to consider 
submitting your scientific work to the special issue.

Papers submitted after the deadline are not guaranteed to be in the 
special issue. They may be sent to Icarus for normal review.

We thank those who have already submitted papers and NOIs and 
encourage other interested parties to email us to let us know if you 
are intending to submit a paper.

Regards,

Adrian Brown (abrown@seti.org)

JPGU-AGU 2017 SESSION P-PS02: SMALL BODIES - EXPLORATION OF THE 
ASTEROID BELT AND THE SOLAR SYSTEM AT LARGE

May 20-25, Makuhari Messe

http://www.jpgu.org/meeting_e2017/

Abstract deadline: February 16, 2017 05:00PM JST (UTC/GMT +9hours)

Small Solar System bodies, including asteroids, comets, satellites, 
and interplanetary dust particles have undergone a recent scientific 
renaissance with new observations that have greatly expanded our 
understanding of the origin and evolution of our Solar System. This 
new information comes from telescopic data, and in-situ observations 
with spacecraft carrying high resolution instruments sensing IR, 
visible, UV, X-rays, gamma ray photons and neutrons. In addition, 
Hayabusa 1 has returned samples to earth and Hayabusa 2 and OSIRIS-REx 
have been sent to return more. In this session, all contributions on 
small solar system bodies are welcome. We welcome all contributions 
on recent advances in the study of asteroids whether obtained by 
rendezvous spacecraft, sample return, analysis of meteorites, remote 
sensing and laboratory research on analogous materials.

SUMMER INTERNSHIPS AT JOHNS HOPKINS APPLIED PHYSICS LAB (APL)
 
APL is looking for the next generation of explorers! The 2017 APL NASA 
Intern Program provides unique opportunities for university students 
to work on NASA missions or other space-related research projects. The 
internship program runs 10 weeks in the summer and applications are 
due March 26; however, selections are made on a continuous basis, so 
interested students should apply as early as possible. More information 
is available at:

http://www.jhuapl.edu/NASAIntern/

IAVCEI SESSION I.1: PLANETARY VOLCANOLOGY

We invite you to submit an abstract to our Planetary Volcanology 
session at the IAVCEI 2017 Scientific Assembly in Portland, OR on 
August 14-18, 2017.

Volcanic activity is a hallmark of almost every large solid-surface 
body in the Solar System. Giant volcanoes dominate the surfaces of 
Venus, Mars, enormous calderas are abundant on Io, and large igneous 
provinces are major physiographic features of Mercury and the Moon. 
Each of these bodies also boasts evidence of pyroclastic activity, and 
evidence of the interplay of volcanic and tectonic processes is 
widespread. In the outer Solar System, numerous icy satellites (and a 
dwarf planet) display evidence indicative of cryovolcanic activity. In 
this session, we solicit contributions exploring the myriad styles of 
volcanic landforms and processes on Solar System bodies (planets, 
moons, or asteroids) using field observations, remotely sensed data, 
laboratory or numerical simulations, or some combination thereof.

Please submit your abstract here: 

http://iavcei2017.org/abstract.html

The submission deadline is March 17, 2017.

Conveners:
Paul K. Byrne (NCSU)
DelWayne R. Bohnenstiehl (NCSU)
Patrick J. McGovern (LPI)

We look forward to seeing you in Portland!

MPC USER COMMITTEE

The Minor Planet Center (MPC) has become a functional sub-node of the 
Small Bodies Node (SBN) of NASA's Planetary Data System (PDS). As part 
of that transition, we are creating a User's Advisory Group for the 
MPC. We would like to include both data providers to the MPC and users 
of the data produced by MPC. We would also consider an orbital 
dynamicist who compares his/her results with those of the MPC. At this 
point we would like to solicit both volunteers and nominees from the 
community. We anticipate an annual face-to-face meeting at the MPC 
(in Cambridge, MA) and intervening electronic meetings perhaps 2 or 3 
times per year. International, i.e., non-US, members are welcome but we 
can not use NASA funds for the travel of international members. Please 
contact both Matt Holman, Director of the MPC, and Mike A'Hearn, PI of 
the PDS Small Bodies Node, with a very brief statement of your, or your 
nominee's, relevance to the committee. See the web pages for the MPC:
