NASA JOB OPENING IN LABORATORY ASTROCHEMISTRY

A NASA civil-servant position is anticipated for early 2018 in the NASA
Goddard Space Flight Center's Astrochemistry Laboratory in Greenbelt,
Maryland. The work will be in the Cosmic Ice group on problems relevant
to low-temperature, low-pressure chemical changes and physical
properties related to solar-system and interstellar materials. The
successful candidate will have laboratory experience in cryogenic,
vacuum, and infrared spectral measurements, preferably some familiarity
with radiation-chemical or photochemical studies. Duties in this
research position will include investigating astrochemical problems
connected to NASA missions and projects.

Applicant should have a PhD or equivalent in chemistry, physics, or a
closely related field, with post-doctoral experience desired. Good oral
and written communications skills are required.

It is anticipated that this position will be at the GS-13 level or,
depending on the applicant's qualifications, GS-14. Interested persons
should watch for the official announcement, with additional details, on
the USAJOBS website. US citizenship at the time of the application is a
requirement for this position.

For more information about this opportunity, please contact Jason
Dworkin (jason.p.dworkin@nasa.gov), Reggie Hudson
(reggie.hudson@nasa.gov), or Perry Gerakines
(perry.a.gerakines@nasa.gov).

[NASA] CALL FOR APPLICATIONS FOR NASA'S CERES SCIENCE DEFINITION TEAM

The Planetary Science Division of NASA's Science Mission Directorate
plans to conduct a generic study of mission options for future
exploration of the dwarf planet Ceres. NASA invites scientists and
other qualified and interested individuals at U.S. institutions to
apply for membership on the Ceres Science Definition Team (SDT).

The Ceres SDT will:

1. Identify and prioritize science objectives to be addressed by
spaceflight mission(s) based upon recommendations from the 2013-2022
Decadal Survey, but also account for recent information and current
state of the science. 
2. Participate in mission studies designed to address those science
objectives. 
3. Assist in the preparation of study reports.

Full details available at:

https://science.nasa.gov/researchers/sara/grant-solicitations

Each Letter of Application, limited to one page with 11-point Times
font and 1-inch margins, must be received by Dr. Michael Kelley via
e-mail no later than December 21, 2017 (5:00 p.m. EST) at the address
below. The subject line of the e-mail should read "Ceres pre-decadal
SDT application".

EGU 2018 SESSION ON EXTRATERRESTRIAL SEISMOLOGY
 
Please consider submitting an abstract to the session PS5.3/SM1.03
"Extraterrestrial Seismology - Advances in instrumentation and
methodology" to be held at EGU on 8-13 April 2018, in Vienna, Austria.

https://meetingorganizer.copernicus.org/EGU2018/session/28537

The abstract submission deadline is 10 Jan 2018, 13:00 CET.

This session discusses advances in seismic instrumentation and
seismological methodology aimed at investigating terrestrial planets,
icy moons, and small bodies.

We welcome contributions presenting (1) robust and low-power seismic
instrumentation adequate for space, including new deployment and sensor
concepts: miniaturization, rotational sensors, or sensors for
atmospheric recordings of seismic waves; (2) seismological methods
adaptable to cases of limited data availability or harsh conditions on
extraterrestrial bodies: dealing with single-station setups, scarce
networks, strong background noise, lack of meta-deta etc.; (3) insights
obtained from previous and recent missions such as Apollo and Rosetta,
preparations for seismic data processing of the InSight mission to
Mars, as well as simulations of seismic experiments on asteroids,
comets, icy moons etc.

We especially invite contributions presenting seismological experiments
in challenging, i.e. analogue terrestrial environments, e.g.
experiments on (floating) ice, in the oceans, or in deserts.

Best regards, 
Stefanie Hempel, Brigitte Knapmeyer-Endrun, Martin Knapmeyer, Savas

GEOSCIENCES SPECIAL ISSUE "RECENT ADVANCES IN LUNAR STUDIES"

Dear Colleagues,

The journal Geosciences is accepting papers for a Special Issue related
to recent advances in studies of the Moon. Since the Apollo era, sample
studies, remote analyses, and dynamical models continue to tease out
details related to the Moon's formation and evolution. Additionally,
the international lunar science community is eager to continue its
presence on the Moon, as evidenced by recent, upcoming, and future
lunar missions. All of these topics are of great interest to the
broader geoscience community.

The Special Issue welcomes papers that describe studies related to any
of the above topics and will be an outlet for rapid, accessible, and
peer-reviewed publications. The editors especially welcome papers from
young investigators.
