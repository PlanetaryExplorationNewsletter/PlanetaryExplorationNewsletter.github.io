NASA SCIENCE/TECHNOLOGY PLATFORM SATELLITE (NSTP-SAT) REQUEST FOR
INFORMATION

SMD has released a Request for Information (RFI) NNH17ZDA002L to assist
in planning for potential payloads on the NASA Science/Technology
Platform Satellite (NSTP-Sat) with a possible launch to low earth
orbit, geostationary equatorial orbit, medium Earth orbit, Earth-Moon
L1, or lunar orbit in the 2021 timeframe.

To respond to this RFI please upload a PDF of up to 10 pages in length
to the NSPIRES system by 11:59 p.m. Eastern time on March 17, 2017.
Based on responses to this RFI, NASA will consider

(i) whether there are science opportunities for new uses of this
spacecraft and 
(ii) whether a solicitation for proposals is warranted to enable such
opportunities.

The full text of the RFI including background on the NSTP-Sat, schedule
milestones, Potential payload classes and accommodations and bus
capabilities, and instructions for responding to this RFI may be found
by following this link or by going to:

https://nspires.nasaprs.com/

NASA POSTDOCTORAL FELLOWSHIPS

The NASA Postdoctoral Program offers US and international scientists
the opportunity to advance their research while contributing to NASA's
scientific goals. The NPP supports fundamental science; explores the
undiscovered; promotes intellectual growth; and encourages scientific
connections.

Selected by a competitive peer-review process, NPP Fellows complete
one- to three-year Fellowship appointments that advance NASA's missions
in earth science, heliophysics, planetary science, astrophysics, space
bioscience, aeronautics and engineering, human exploration and space
operations, and astrobiology.

Current research opportunities in planetary science can be viewed here:

https://npp.usra.edu/opportunities/?filter_keywords=&filter_fields=145

Applicants must have a Ph.D. or equivalent degree in hand before
beginning the fellowship, but may apply while completing the degree
requirements. U.S. citizens, Lawful Permanent Residents, and foreign
nationals eligible for J-1 status as a Research Scholar may apply.

Stipends start at $53,500 per year, with supplements for high

ROADMAPS TO OCEAN WORLDS (ROW) TOWNHALL AT LPSC

The Roadmaps to Ocean Worlds (ROW) team was chartered by OPAG to
identify science objectives for Ocean Worlds and to design a roadmap
(or roadmaps) to explore these worlds to address the identified science
objectives. We will be holding a ROW townhall at LPSC (Thursday, March

in the complex interactions between magmas and ice in all its forms on
Earth and other planets.

Elected Officers rotate each year and the Secretary elected for the
2017-2018 term will become the Vice-Chair in 2018-2019, the Chair in
2019-2020 and then becomes ex officio for one year to serve as a
consultant, if needed.

This year, nominees are encouraged to have a research focus in
Planetary Sciences, whereas next year the focus will be Glaciology and
the year after Field Geology.

Please send your nominations either to Christopher Hamilton
(hamilton@lpl.arizona.edu) or to Benjamin Edwards
