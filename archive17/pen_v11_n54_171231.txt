TENURED FULL PROFESSOR POSITION IN ASTROBIOLOGY

The Institute for Planetary Materials (IPM), Okayama University, 
Misasa, Japan, invites applications for a Tenured Full Professor 
position in the area of Astrobiology.

IPM is a world-class institute with the aim of advancing research and 
education on the origin, evolution and dynamics of the Earth and 
planets. The Institute provides leadership in the fields of analytical 
planetary chemistry and experimental geophysics, hosting comprehensive, 
state-of-the-art analytical systems (including multiple element/isotope 
analysis and multiple dating techniques at various scales) and a range 
of high-pressure and high-temperature apparatus and spectroscopic 
facilities.

Further information about the faculty, research and facilities of the 
Institute can be found at the IPM website:

OUTREACH COORDINATOR POSITIONS OPEN

The Solar System Exploration Division (SSED) at NASA Goddard Space 
Flight Center (GSFC) located in Greenbelt, Maryland has positions open 
for Outreach Coordinator. The Solar System Exploration Division 
conducts theoretical and experimental research to explore the solar 
system and understand the formation and evolution of planetary systems. 
Laboratories within the Division investigate areas as diverse as 
astrochemistry, planetary atmospheres, extrasolar planetary systems, 
planetary geodynamics, space geodesy, and comparative planetary studies.
 
For more information about the duties of this position and minimum 
requirements or to apply please see:

IAU GENERAL ASSEMBLY MINI-CONFERENCE - RECENT ADVANCES IN PLANETARY 
ASTRONOMY

We would like to announce a two-day mini-conference on recent advances 
on planetary astronomy. The conference is organized by the IAU 
Division F (Planetary Systems & Astrobiology) in conjunction with the 
30th General Assembly of the International Astronomical Union that will 
be held in August 2018 in Vienna. The purpose of this program is to 
bring together researchers from all fields of planetary astronomy 
(Solar system and extrasolar planets) to present their new findings in 
form of oral and poster presentations, and discuss the current state
of research in our field. The website of the conference can be found at:

http://www.ifa.hawaii.edu/planetsdays2018/

The mini-conference is held on August 24 & 27, 2018 during the IAU 
General Assembly. 

Registration is now open and abstracts are accepted from all fields of 
planetary astronomy for oral and poster presentations. The deadline for 
early registration discount is January 31. Participants in this 
workshop will receive admission to all scientific activities of the 
IAU General Assembly including the Focus Meeting 1 on asteroid 
families, IAU Symposium 345 on the origin of life and planetary 
systems, and a training school in Astrobiology held on August 17-18, 
2018 by the University of Vienna.

We look forward to seeing you in Vienna.

President of the IAU Division F

2018 AOGS SESSION PS10 - ON THE DWARF PLANET CERES AFTER DAWN

Honolulu, Hawaii 
June 3-8, 2018

Abstract deadline: January 19

http://www.asiaoceania.org/aogs2018/

Since 2015, the Dawn spacecraft has orbited Ceres, the largest body in 
the asteroid belt, and has returned a wealth of data. This session aims 
to summarize and synthesize our current understanding of Ceres, and 
welcomes submissions that study Ceres through a variety of techniques, 
including Dawn and telescopic data analyses, modeling studies, analog 
studies, and laboratory investigations. Ceres is weakly differentiated 
into a rocky and comparatively dense interior and a more water-ice-rich 
outer layer. Water ice facilitates the formation of particular types of 
lobate flows and is likely located in some polar permanently shadowed 
craters. Phyllosilicates are homogeneously distributed across the 
surface, indicating global scale alteration, possibly in an ancient 
ocean. Organic materials have also been detected on the surface. Occator 
crater contains distinctly bright regions, called faculae, which are 
proposed to be the solid residues of brines sourced in the subsurface. 
Ahuna Mons is a ~4 km high edifice interpreted as a recently formed 
viscous cryovolcanic dome. 

We look forward to seeing you in Honolulu!

MAGNETOSPHERES OF THE OUTER PLANETS 2018

The 2018 conference on Magnetospheres of the Outer Planets will be held 
at the University of Colorado, Boulder on July 9-13. The time is ripe 
to compare data from the last orbits of Cassini around Saturn with the 
polar orbits of Juno around Jupiter. And to keep thinking about those 
weird and wonderful magnetospheres of Uranus and Neptune. Information 
about the meeting is at:
