[NASA] RELEASE OF SALMON-3 AND MMX PROGRAM ELEMENT APPENDIX

Around March 22, 2017, NASA will be releasing the Third Stand Alone
Missions of Opportunity Notice (SALMON-3) Announcement of Opportunity
(AO). The SALMON-3 AO provides a solicitation and procurement base for
modest investigations, or Missions of Opportunity (MO), requiring space
flight that advance the high priority science, exploration, and
technology objectives of NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Human
Exploration and Operations Mission Directorate, and the Space
Technology Mission Directorate. This release includes one proposal
opportunity for a Discovery Program Focused Mission of Opportunity
Martian Moons eXploration (MMX) Neutron and Gamma-Ray Spectrometer
Investigation.

The SALMON-3 solicitation will be open from March 21, 2017, through
March 18, 2022. Further information about the solicitation and each
Program Element Appendices (PEA) will be available on the SALMON-3
Acquisition Page:

https://soma.larc.nasa.gov/salmon-3/index.html

A Pre-proposal Conference will be held April 17, 2017 via Webex. For
exact date, time, agenda, and logistics, see the MMX PEA additional
information page at:

http://soma.larc.nasa.gov/mmx/

Direct questions specifically regarding PEA-I to:

Dr. Thomas Statler 
MMX Program Scientist

HST OBSERVATIONS TO DETECT PLUMES/OUTGASSING FROM EUROPA 

The STScI Director has commissioned a committee to provide advice on
optimizing future strategies for using Hubble to investigate potential
outgassing from Europa. The committee is currently developing
recommendations that will include suggestions for pilot observations in
the near future. The full report will not be available until after the
Cycle 25 proposal deadline (April 7, 2017). Consequently, interested
parties should not submit proposals at this time unless the
observations must be executed before October 27 2017. Time will be set
aside for observations at later dates, and proposals related to the
Europan plumes will be solicited as part of the first Cycle 25 Call for
Mid-Cycle proposals, deadline September 30 2017.
