LSST AND THE SOLAR SYSTEM WORKSHOP

Thursday October 19 2017, 4:30-6:30 pm
49th DPS meeting, Provo, UT - Open to all DPS attendees 
Organizers: Meg Schwamb (Gemini) & David Trilling (NAU)

Over its 10 year lifespan, the Large Synoptic Sky Survey Telescope
(LSST) will catalog over 5 million Main Belt asteroids, almost 300,000
Jupiter Trojans, over 100,000 NEOs, and over 40,000 KBOs. Many of these
objects will receive hundreds of observations in multiple bandpasses.
The LSST Solar System Science Collaboration (SSSC) is preparing methods
and tools to analyze this data, as well as understand optimum survey
strategies for discovering moving objects throughout the Solar System.

This workshop serves as the annual meeting of the LSST SSSC, and is
open to everyone. We will provide a brief status of LSST with respect
to Solar System science and provide updates on current and future
activities within the SSSC. The focus will not be on general LSST
background but on details relevant to Solar System science topics.
There will be time set aside for open discussion for both members of
the SSSC and the broader planetary community.

Contact Meg Schwamb (mschwamb.astro@gmail.com) and David Trilling
(David.Trilling@nau.edu) with any questions

TWO POSTDOCTORAL POSITIONS IN MARS SCIENCE

The Department of Planetology and Habitability at the Centro de
Astrobiologia (CAB) invites applications for two postdoctoral positions
to support investigations on the nature of the early Mars environments.
The successful candidate will work with Dr. Alberto Fairen in the
ERC-funded Project "icyMARS".

Applicants should have a recent Ph.D. in the field of Planetary Science
or related discipline, and background in sedimentology of ice-covered
lakes, or in biology of psychrophilic microorganisms.

The positions, placed in Madrid, would be for one year, with possible
extension to a second year contingent upon funding availability and
satisfactory performance. Benefits include working in a young
enthusiastic team at one of the leading Planetary Sciences institutions
in Europe, full social benefits according to the Spanish social care
system, and a very competitive salary.

Applicants should send a letter of interest, a curriculum with a list
of publications, a brief (maximum two pages) statement of research
interests, and a list of three references, no later than September 10
2017, to Alberto Fairen (agfairen@cab.inta-csic.es).

The starting date is negotiable, but should be no later than Jan 1,
2018.

ARIZONA-JAXA WORKSHOP

The Institute of Space and Astronautical Science (ISAS) of the Japan
Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) and the Lunar and Planetary
Laboratory (LPL) of the University of Arizona will hold the second
annual workshop dedicated to planetary science enabled by missions to
be led JAXA on November 12 and 13, 2017, at LPL in Tucson, Arizona.
Given the nature of the workshop described below, participation will be
limited to the first 50 registrants.

This workshop will be devoted to discussions of planetary missions that
are within the reach of ISAS capability and how to make these missions
fruitful for the world-wide planetary science community. Three specific
topics:

1) The DESTINY+ mission will fly by asteroid 3200 Phaethon, the parent
body of the Geminid meteor shower. 
2) JAXA is studying the SolarPowerSail (SPS) mission to the Jupiter
Trojans.
3) Small body science would benefit greatly from opportunities to
perform flybys of a wide variety of asteroids - the workshop will
include a discussion of asteroids suggested by workshop participants as
flyby targets. Presentations for this portion of the workshop will be
selected based on short abstracts from registered participants.

To register or for more details:

Deadline for abstract submission is 5 p.m. MST, October 27, 2017 or
when registration is full, whichever is earlier.
