independent research in the area(s) of solid surface planetary and/or
laboratory spectroscopy (VNIR and/or TIR), and is expected to publish
scientific papers on a regular basis. This position entails regular
travel (about two weeks duration, every other month) to Ithaca College
(Ithaca, NY), travel to science team meetings (two/year, usually in
Tucson AZ), and co-location in Tucson AZ for mission-critical events,
primarily in the first half of calendar year 2019. The desired start
date is 2 January 2018; the position is for two years, with the
potential to extend for a third year.

Applications must include a curriculum vitae, cover letter, statement
of research interests and contact information for three professional
references.
