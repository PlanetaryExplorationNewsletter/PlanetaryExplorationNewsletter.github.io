2018 AOGS MEETING SESSION ON FIELD AND LABORATORY STUDIES

Dear colleagues,

We would like to draw your attention to a session focused on field and
laboratory studies that we are convening at the 2018 AOGS meeting in
Honolulu, Hawaii, June 3-8, 2018. Our intention is to bring together
researchers from all over Asia as well as the Americas and Europe to
present the latest field and laboratory studies in support of remote
infrared studies of planetary bodies. 

Abstract deadline: January 19

http://www.asiaoceania.org/aogs2018/public.asp?page=abstract.htm

Look forward to seeing you in Honolulu!

PS22: Field and Laboratory Studies in Support of Planetary Infrared
Remote Sensing This session will highlight the importance of
comprehensive analog studies towards understanding planetary remote
sensing datasets, with a focus on the near infrared and thermal
infrared. Contributions that probe the links between the small-scale of
laboratory (microns-mm) and ground/airborne field (cm-m) measurement to
the large-scale (10s meters-km) in remote sensing observations to
better interpret the properties of surfaces and atmospheres are
encouraged. This session is open to a diverse range of planetary
bodies. New developments of instrumentation and techniques used in
field and laboratory studies are also welcome.

LUNAR SCIENCE FOR LANDED MISSIONS WORKSHOP PROGRAM AND REGISTRATION

The Lunar Science for Landed Missions Workshop will take place on 10-12
January 2018 at SSERVI Central, NASA Ames. The program is now set and
can be found at: 

https://lunar-landing.arc.nasa.gov/program

Registration is required so if attending please register here:
 
https://lunar-landing.arc.nasa.gov/registration

The workshop will feature a series of invited talks highlighting the
contributions of recent lunar missions to detailed knowledge of the
lunar surface. The workshop will then proceed with a series of
contributed presentations highlighting potential lunar landing sites,
each describing the individual site's benefit to science and/or human
exploration (e.g., ISRU). Presentations will discuss the merits of a
proposed site in terms of its benefit(s), involving one or more of the
following:

a) Short term reconnaissance and/or surface science experiments (<one
lunar day) 
b) Sample return 
c) Long term monitoring (days, years) 
d) Regional roving experiments (ala MSL) 
e) Technological demonstrations that feed forward 
f) Technological demonstrations for ISRU 
g) Other

On behalf of the SOC, we would like to invite you to attend and
participate in this opportunity to fashion the next stage of lunar
science and exploration.

[NASA] ROSES-17 AMENDMENT 57: JUNO PSP FINAL TEXT
 
The objective of the Juno Participating Scientist Program will be to
enhance the scientific return during the science phase of the Juno
mission by expanding participation in the mission through new
investigations that broaden and/or complement existing mission
investigations. The PI of a selected proposal, and that person alone,
will be added to the Juno Science Team as a Participating Scientist and
will be given all of the rights and responsibilities of Juno Co-Is, as
per the Juno Rules of the Road.

This amendment releases final text for this program element which was
previously released as draft for community comment. Step-1 Proposals
are due March 1 2018 and Step-2 Proposals are due April 26, 2018.
 
This Amendment to the NASA Research Announcement ROSES 2017 will be
posted on the NASA research opportunity homepage at: 

http://nspires.nasaprs.com/ 

and will appear on the RSS feed at: 

https://science.nasa.gov/researchers/sara/grant-solicitations/roses-
2017/

CALL FOR WHITE PAPERS ON A FUTURE NASA OPEN-SOURCE POLICY

NASA has requested the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and
Medicine to investigate and recommend best practices as the Science
Mission Directorate considers whether to establish an open-code policy,
complementary to its current open-data policy. A study committee has
been appointed and solicits white papers. The committee's statement of
task, membership, activity schedule, and instructions for white papers
are at:

http://sites.nationalacademies.org/SSB/CurrentProjects/SSB_178892

The goal of this call is to hear broadly from the community on any
relevant issues, situations, or points of view, to ensure consideration
of the full set of possible consequences of any new NASA open
source-policy. For the purpose of this call, "open-code" and
"open-source" refer to computer program source codes released publicly
under an open source license, as defined by the Open Source Initiative:

https://opensource.org/licenses

To be considered at the committee's next meeting, white-paper
submissions are due no later than January 12, 2018. The committee
strongly encourages authors to submit white papers by this deadline,
but papers will continue to be received until midnight on January 31,
2018.

Send questions about the project or white paper submissions to
asheffer@nas.edu.

[NASA] MARS NOW A CYCLE 1 TARGET FOR WEBB
 
Mars has been one of the targets for James Webb Space Telescope from
the outset (see white paper at https://arxiv.org/pdf/1510.04619.pdf).
But prior to the launch date change, it was only available in Cycle 2.
With the revised dates, Mars is now available in Cycle 1. Heidi
Hammel, Webb Interdisciplinary Scientist for Solar System Observations,
thus requested that 5 hours of her guaranteed time be reprogrammed for
Mars observations. Webb will obtain NIRCam images at 2.2 and 4.3
microns, as well as a full NIRSPEC survey (all gratings), employing a
mosaic on Mars of 4 x 4 with the 0.2 x 3.3 slit.  Hammel's Mars team,
led by Geronimo Villanueva (NASA GSFC), expects detections of both H2O
and HDO. According to the current Exposure Time Calculator, Mars will
saturate in some cases, but many regions (both on the disk and in the
spectra) the data should be excellent. This Mars data from Webb will be
made available to the planetary community immediately, in order to
facilitate planning for Mars observations with Webb.

[NASA] NASA JOB OPENING IN LABORATORY ASTROCHEMISTRY

A NASA civil-servant position is available in the NASA Goddard Space
Flight Center's Astrochemistry Laboratory in Greenbelt, Maryland. The

the group's recent work, see the Cosmic Ice Laboratory's website at: 

https://science.gsfc.nasa.gov/691/cosmicice/

Candidates should have good oral and written communications skills,
laboratory experience in cryogenic, vacuum, and infrared spectral
measurements, and preferably some familiarity with radiation-chemical
or photochemical studies. Duties in this research position will include
investigating astrochemical problems connected to NASA missions and
projects.

agenda, and logistics.

2. The first day of the Spring 2018 MEPAG meeting is a forum for the
identification of mission objectives and concepts that address
high-priority Mars science questions, with an emphasis on the science
that can be achieved over the next two decades. To help us help gauge
interest and scope of this forum, please submit an expression of

PLANETARY IMPACT GEOCHEMIST POSITION
 
Applications are invited for a position at NASA's Goddard Space Flight
Center in the Planetary Geology, Geophysics and Geochemistry
Laboratory. We are looking for someone with demonstrated capability in
geochemical studies of impact event ages and developing scientific
requirements for conducting in situ geochemical studies on the surfaces
of the moon, planets, planetary satellites, and small bodies.
Demonstrated expertise in geologic field studies of terrestrial analogs
and conducting in situ and laboratory geochemical studies of physical
and chemical characteristics of impact processes on planetary surfaces
is required. Previous experience in developing approaches to improve in
situ instrumentation and measurement techniques for constraining impact
event ages, is required. The incumbent will apply scientific research,
mission operations and engineering perspectives to develop unique, new,
or improved techniques for planning, designing, and testing of science
operational scenarios that feed into the definition of science
requirements for future surface mission operations.
