INTERNATIONAL OBSERVE THE MOON NIGHT - OCTOBER 28, 2017
 
International Observe the Moon Night (InOMN) is an annual worldwide
celebration of our Moon, its connection to planetary science and
exploration, and the cultural and personal connections we all have to
our nearest celestial neighbor. Everyone on Earth is invited to
participate by hosting or participating in an InOMN event, which range
in size and scope and venue around the world.

The next International Observe the Moon Night is Saturday, October 28.
Go look at the Moon! Invite your family, friends, and neighbors to look
with you. Find an event near you, or let NASA know you'll be observing
the Moon from wherever you'll be, through: 

http://observethemoonnight.org.
 
Here you will also find more information about International Observe
the Moon Night and InOMN resources, including an event planning guide,
the 2017 InOMN Moon map, recommended activities and visualizations,
evaluation materials, and more.

InOMN is sponsored by NASA's Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO)
mission, with support from NASA's Solar System Exploration Research
Virtual Institute (SSERVI), the Lunar and Planetary Institute (LPI),
and other partners.

5TH INTERNATIONAL PLANETARY DUNE WORKSHOP JGR SPECIAL ISSUE: SUBMISSION
OPEN

JGR is now accepting submissions for the 5th International Planetary
Dune Workshop special issue. All the papers focusing on eolian and
fluvial bedforms on different bodies of our Solar System (including
Earth) are welcomed. The papers of the special issue can focus on all
aspects of the mechanism of bedform formation and development (geology,
geomorphology, sedimentology, physics of transport and modeling).
Papers on yardangs morphology and development are also welcomed.
Attendance at the meeting is not required to submit a paper.

42ND SCIENTIFIC ASSEMBLY OF THE COMMITTEE ON SPACE RESEARCH (COSPAR)
 
The Committee on Space Research (COSPAR) will hold its 42nd Scientific
Assembly in Pasadena, California, USA, on 14-22 July, 2018. The COSPAR
Scientific Assemblies supply a forum to all scientists involved in
space research for the presentation of their latest scientific results,
the exchange of knowledge and also the discussion of space research
problems.
 
Abstract submission is now open (deadline 9 February, 2018).
 
There will be a number of Planetary Science sessions to which abstract
are welcomed: 
- The Study of Exoplanet Atmospheres and the Search for Life Outside of
  the Solar System
- Planetary Science Enabled by CubeSats and Microprobes
- Observations of Planetary Objects with Non-Planetary Spacecraft
- The Golden Age of Small Bodies, Science and Exploration
- Pluto and Charon: The New Horizons Mission Results
- Growing Up: the Long Journey of Planetary Systems from Interstellar
  Volatiles and Refractories to Asteroids, Comets, and Planets
- References Frames for Applications of Geosciences (REFAG2018)
- Lunar Science and Exploration
- Mars Science Results
- Forward Planning for the Robotic Exploration of Mars
- Juno at Jupiter
- Cassini Highlights at Saturn
- Ocean Worlds: Europa, Enceladus, Titan, and Beyond

REQUESTING INDICATIONS OF INTEREST FOR MEPAG COMMITTEE MEMBERSHIP

The Mars Exploration Program Analysis Group (MEPAG) serves as a
community-based, interdisciplinary forum for inquiry and analysis in
support of planning and implementing Mars exploration objectives. The
MEPAG Terms of Reference and organization are described more fully at:

https://mepag.jpl.nasa.gov/about.cfm

The two executive bodies for MEPAG are: 

The MEPAG Executive Committee members discuss and approve MEPAG
reports, meeting agendas, and committee and science analysis group
(SAG) membership and charters.

The MEPAG Goals Committee members maintain and, based on new
discoveries and findings, update the MEPAG Goals Document:

https://mepag.jpl.nasa.gov/reports.cfm?expand=science

Membership of the Executive and Goals Committees are solicited from the
MEPAG community and determined by the MEPAG Chair and current Executive
Committee members. Terms of service are typically 2-3 years, depending
on MEPAG tasks and desire for overlapping terms. Participation in the
Executive Committee includes a monthly telecon, participation in MEPAG
community meetings, reviews of MEPAG reports, and related activities. 
Goals Committee activity is dependent upon the pace of updates to the
Goals Document. Related travel is supported (except for civil
servants); time is not.

altimeters. Demonstrated expertise in developing innovative approaches
that combine laser altimetry ranges with stereo imaging is required.
Previous experience in development, implementation, planning, and
interpretation of new operation modes for flight instruments,
leveraging sophisticated modeling tools such as illumination modeling
algorithms, is required. The incumbent will develop new techniques for
extracting quantitative ranging and ancillary information acquired by
laser altimeters. The incumbent is expected to participate in the
development of new and advanced approaches to laser altimetry
instrumentation and acquisition of surface topography for the planets,
Moon, asteroids and satellites.
