IN MEMORIAM: PLANETARY SCIENTIST NATHAN BRIDGES

Nathan Bridges, a planetary research scientist at the Johns Hopkins
University Applied Physics Laboratory (APL), died on April 26. He was
50 years old.

Bridges was a senior expert on the geology of Mars, remote sensing
techniques, and the role of wind-driven processes in planetary erosion
and sedimentation on Earth, Mars, and Titan, Saturn's largest moon.
Among his many important findings, Bridges discovered that wind is as
important a geologic process on Mars as it is on Earth, despite the
much lower density of the Martian atmosphere.

He was an integral part of multiple Mars missions and instrument teams:
he served as a Co-Investigator on the High Resolution Imaging Science
Experiment (HiRISE) instrument on the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, a
Co-Investigator on the Mars Science Laboratory (Curiosity rover)
ChemCam instrument, and a science team member on two Mars-2020 rover
instruments, SuperCam and the Mars Environmental Dynamics Analyzer.

Bridges is survived by his wife Karen, daughter Sarah, and son Matthew.

Meeting number: 640 002 474 Password: JWST2018

The General Observer (GO) Call for Proposals will be released on
November 30, 2017, with a submission due date of March 2, 2018. Get
ahead of the game by joining STScI's John Stansberry and Bryan Holler
for a hands-on demonstration of the ETC in the context of Solar System
observations. This webinar will also feature an overview of Pandeia,
the downloadable ETC engine written in Python, and a request for
community input on Pandeia tools and capabilities that would be useful
for planning observations.

Attendance information and a recording of the webinar will also be
available on the JWST events page at:

NASA POSTDOCTORAL FELLOWSHIPS
 
The NASA Postdoctoral Program offers US and international scientists
the opportunity to advance their research while contributing to NASA's
scientific goals. The NPP supports fundamental science, explores the
undiscovered, promotes intellectual growth, and encourages scientific
connections.

Selected by a competitive peer-review process, NPP Fellows complete
one- to three-year Fellowship appointments that advance NASA's missions
in earth science, heliophysics, planetary science, astrophysics, space
bioscience, aeronautics and engineering, human exploration and space
operations, and astrobiology.

Current research opportunities in planetary science can be viewed here:

https://npp.usra.edu/opportunities/?filter_keywords=&filter_fields=145

Applicants must have a Ph.D. or equivalent degree in hand before
beginning the fellowship, but may apply while completing the degree
requirements. U.S. citizens, Lawful Permanent Residents, and foreign
nationals eligible for J-1 status as a Research Scholar may apply.

Stipends start at $53,500 per year, with supplements for high
cost-of-living areas and for certain academic specialties. Financial
assistance is available for relocation and health insurance, and $8,000
per year is provided for professional travel.

Applications are accepted three times each year: March 1, July 1, and
November 1.

CALL FOR EXTERNAL REVIEWERS NASA POSTDOCTORAL PROGRAM

The NASA Postdoctoral Program (NPP), managed by USRA, provides young
and more senior scientists the opportunity to work on 1 to 3 year
assignments with NASA scientists and engineers at NASA centers and
institutes to advance NASA's missions in earth science, heliophysics,
planetary science, astrophysics, space bioscience, aeronautics,
engineering, human exploration and space operations, astrobiology, and
science management. USRA is recruiting well-qualified reviewers for
upcoming applications.

Reviewers may be asked to review up to 5 applications (each application
is 15 pages, including figures and citations; double-spaced). 
Proposals deadlines are March 1, July 1, and November 1. The reviewer
