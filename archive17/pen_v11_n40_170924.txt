ASSESSING NASA COMPLIANCE WITH THE PLANETARY DECADAL RECOMMENDATION FOR
RESEARCH AND ANALYSIS PROGRA FUNDING

Using budget numbers obtained directly and through Freedom of 
Information Act requests, analysis has been undertaken of NASA 
compliance with the Planetary Decadal Survey recommendation for growth 
in the support of Research and Analysis (R&A) programs. It is concluded 
that the recommendation has not been met and that R&A programs may have 
been underfunded by almost $90M from FY13 through FY16. The budget data 
and its assessment is posted at:

and planetary sciences, astrobiology, astrophysics and cosmology, 
instrumentation and systems engineering, and science education.

Incoming Fellows will receive an annual stipend of $63,000 with health 
benefits, plus $9,000 per year in discretionary research funds. A 
relocation allowance will be provided. Appointments will be for up to 
three years and shall commence on or around July 1, 2018.

PHD POSITION AT DLR IN BERLIN

PhD position on numerical and experimental investigation of asteroid 
and comet regolith.

The Institute of Planetary Research at the German Aerospace Center 
(DLR) in Berlin invites applications for a PhD position within the 
framework of a DLR junior research group. The group works on the 
interpretation of surface features related to volatile content on 
asteroids and comets via an interdisciplinary approach including 
cartographic preparations, geologic analysis of remote sensing data of 
space missions as well as experimental and numerical simulations. The 
successful candidate will work on the adaptation of a numerical code 
to simulate dynamical processes on asteroid and comet surfaces and the 
validation of the simulation by means of laboratory experiments and 
space mission data.

Candidates should hold a master degree in physics or closely related 
field.

Interested candidates should send a letter of motivation stating their 
research interests and relevant experience, a CV and copies of grade 
transcripts/diplomas. Applications should be submitted via the link 
above.

2ND INFORMATIONAL CIRCULAR FOR MEPAG MEETING 35

The 35th meeting of the Mars Exploration Program Analysis Group (MEPAG) 
is scheduled as a virtual meeting on Monday, September 25th, 2017, 
10:00am-1:00pm PDT. The final agenda and connection information is 
posted at:

https://mepag.jpl.nasa.gov/meetings.cfm?expand=m35

The main topic at this meeting will be low-cost, "opportunistic" 
mission concepts, as such missions may provide a new way of advancing 
Mars science through observations within the Mars system. We will hear 
from the 5 Mars mission concept teams selected for study under NASA's 
Planetary Science Deep Space SmallSat Studies (PSDS3) program:

https://www.nasa.gov/feature/nasa-selects-cubesat-smallsat-mission
-concept-studies

PRISM: Phobos Regolith Ion Sample Mission 
PI Michael Collier, NASA GSFC

Chariot to the Moons of Mars 
PI David Minton, Purdue University 
(presented by Co-I Briony Horgan, Purdue University)

Aeolus - to study the thermal and wind environment of Mars 
PI Anthony Colaprete, NASA ARC

MISEN: Mars Ion and Sputtering Escape Network 
PI Robert Lillis, UC Berkeley

MAT: Mars Aerosol Tracker 
PI Luca Montabone, SSI

There will also be a presentation from the Mars Exploration Program 
Director Jim Watzin on the status of discussions about future Mars 
mission architecture.

[NASA] TECH FLIGHTS - FLIGHT OPPORTUNITIES NOW OPEN

NASA Headquarters has released a solicitation, titled "NASA Flight 
Opportunities (FO): Technology Advancement Utilizing Suborbital Flight 
Opportunities" as an Appendix to the Space Technology Mission 
Directorate (STMD) NASA Research Announcement (NRA), titled "Space 
Technology Research, Development, Demonstration, and Infusion 2017 
(SpaceTech-REDDI-2017)."

Applications are due on or before November 3, 2017, and selections will 
be announced in February 2018 (target). The solicitation is available 
on NSPIRES at:

http://tinyurl.com/NASA-17FO-F1B

Dates for two Q&A sessions dates will be announced in the near future. 

The program strategically invests in the growth of the commercial 
spaceflight market while helping advance technologies that will enable 
future space missions for science and exploration. 

The purpose of this Appendix is to provide funding for the testing or 
demonstration of crosscutting space technologies in relevant 
environments through flights on reusable suborbital launch vehicles, 
reduced gravity aircraft, and high-altitude balloons. These flight 
tests should fit into an overall technology maturation plan as a 
bridge between laboratory testing and demonstration in Earth orbit or 
beyond. The proposer's organization will directly purchase the 
proposed flight(s) on currently available U.S. commercial platforms of 
their choice.

LUNAR SCIENCE FOR LANDED MISSIONS WORKSHOP

SSERVI and LEAG, in partnership, are pleased to announce the "Lunar 
Science for Landed Missions Workshop," January 10-12, 2018, at NASA 
Ames Research Center. This workshop is intended to produce a set of 
priority targets for near-term landed missions on the Moon, primarily, 
but not exclusively, from commercial exploration firms interested in 
pursuing ventures on the Moon. Abstracts are solicited describing 
target areas on the Moon for near-term in-situ science, network 
science, and sample return missions. Abstracts should be up to one page 
in length and are intended to stimulate discussion about specific 
targets. This workshop will result in a report to be presented to NASA 
Headquarters as an initial community consensus of priority landed 
targets, with the potential of future solicitations for science-focused 
payloads at such target sites.

Further information on this workshop, along with information on 
logistics, abstract guidelines and submission, and workshop 
registration, is available at: 

https://lunar-landing.arc.nasa.gov  

Abstracts are due on November 10, 2017.
