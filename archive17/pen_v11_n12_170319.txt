EDITOR SUSAN BENECCHI DEPARTING PEN

PSI Senior Scientist Susan Benecchi has been volunteering her time as 
a Planetary Exploration Newsletter editor since May 2, 2010. That 
is pushing seven years of weekends during which she has diligently 
edited and co-edited 393 issues of PEN, helping and communicating with 
submitters, making a lot of judgment calls, and always working to 
improve our product. She has decided it is now time to roll off and 
focus on other activities. It has been a real pleasure working with 
her! We would also like to welcome PSI Associate Research Scientist 
Elisabeth Adams to our editorial team.

NOI REQUEST FOR VENUS SMALL MISSION STUDIES

The Venus Exploration Analysis Group (VEXAG) requests your Notice of 
Interest to support "VenusBridge," a concept for one or more small 
missions with launch dates in the early-to-mid 2020s. The intent 
is to determine if there are lower cost options for the continuity of 
US Venus exploration between Magellan and any potential future 
Discovery, New Frontiers, or strategic mission. Within a nominal
cost cap of $200M, VenusBridge might accommodate a single mission or 
multiple smallsats or cubesats, including orbiters, probes, or 
landers. VEXAG is seeking innovative ideas on mission architectures 
(including launch), technology, and science investigations, including 
possible subsystems (e.g. bus, telecom) and novel techniques for 
answering key Venus science questions in this low cost range. See:

http://www.lpi.usra.edu/vexag/reports/GOI-140625.pdf 

The VenusBridge concept will be previewed at the LPSC 
Venus Town Hall Meeting. A VEXAG VenusBridge Focus Group will 
subsequently be formed. If you have a great idea for low-cost Venus 
exploration, please send a summary up to one page in length,
including your contact information, to VEXAG Chair Bob Grimm,
grimm@boulder.swri.edu. Also please indicate if you are interested 
in serving on the Focus Group.

CALL FOR PAPERS ON OCCATOR CRATER ON CERES

The Dawn mission has collected a wealth of data about the dwarf planet 
Ceres with its Framing Camera, Visible and Infrared Mapping 
Spectrometer, Gamma Ray and Neutron Detector and gravity science 
investigation. Occator crater is one of the most intriguing locations 
on Ceres as observed by Dawn, and it contains distinctive bright 
regions called the Cerealia Facula and Vinalia Faculae. Our 
understanding of the formation and evolution of Occator crater, in 
particular the Cerealia and Vinalia Faculae, is currently under 
investigation. We hereby call for submissions of papers to a special 
issue on the "The Formation and Evolution of Ceres' Occator Crater". 
These papers will focus on interpretations and explanations of the 
processes that formed Occator crater, and may also discuss the 
resulting implications for our understanding of Ceres' formation and 
evolution. We envisage that the majority of submissions will base 
their investigations on Dawn data. However, submissions relevant to 
Occator crater that are based on a wide range of datasets and 
techniques are welcome. For further details see:

NSPIRES USERS ENCOURAGED TO COMPLETE DEMOGRAPHIC INFORMATION

The objective of the demographics survey in NSPIRES is to better 
understand all of the scientific communities that NASA funds, 
including planetary science, and to understand any underlying 
diversity issues that may be occurring. Using this information the NASA 
Office of Chief Scientist can work to identify recommendations of 
inclusive practices to help improve the diversity of our professional 
communities and reduce or mitigate issues of implicit bias. 

Providing the data allows for the Office of the Chief Scientist to 
capture a true snapshot of our professional community. Providing this 
information is completely voluntary, and the data you provide are 
confidential. Only the Office of the Chief Scientist has access to the 
information, and your demographic data are not seen during the review 
process or by Program Officers when they make their selections.

Go to:

https://nspires.nasaprs.com/external/index.do 

and click on the "Account Management" link. Then click on the 
"Personal Profile" link, complete the demographics data section on the

VENERA-D VENUS MODELLING WORKSHOP

October 5-7, 2017 
(the week before the 7th Moscow Solar System Symposium)

Location: IKI, Moscow, Russia

Workshop Objectives: To understand the limitations and needs of current 
models (e.g. General Circulation Models or GCMs, interior structure 
models and plasma environment), landing site selection, and the types 
of measurements needed to more adequately constrain parameters in the
models and experiments. This would in turn form a basis to better 
identify the types of instruments needed to achieve the important 
science of Venera-D.

More information will be forthcoming. Point of contact for the workshop 
is Dima Gorinov (gorinov-dmitry@yandex.ru ).
