ESA RESEARCH FELLOWSHIPS IN SPACE SCIENCE

The European Space Agency awards several postdoctoral fellowships each
year.

The aim of these fellowships is to provide young scientists, holding a
PhD or the equivalent degree, with the means of performing space
science research in fields related to the ESA Science Programmes.

Areas of research include planetary science, astronomy and
astrophysics, solar and solar-terrestrial science, plasma physics and
fundamental physics. The fellowships have a duration of two years, with
the possible extension to three years, and are tenable at the European
Space Research and Technology Centre (ESTEC) in Noordwijk, Netherlands,
or at the European Space Astronomy Centre (ESAC) in Villafranca del
Castillo, near Madrid, Spain.

Applications are now solicited for fellowships in space science to
begin in the fall of 2018. Preference will be given to candidates
within five years of receiving their PhD. Candidates not holding a PhD
yet are encouraged to apply, but they must provide evidence of
receiving their degree before starting the fellowship.

Deadline: October 2, 2017

SPICE TRAINING CLASS

NASA's Navigation and Ancillary Information Facility (NAIF) announces a
"SPICE" training class to be held November 7-9, 2017, in the Pasadena,
CA, area. SPICE is a system used by scientists worldwide to
compute observation geometry associated with instruments aboard robotic
spacecraft. The class is free and open to all persons, including
foreign and commercial.

AGU SESSION: PRESENT-DAY LANDSCAPE EVOLUTION ON MARS

Session ID: 23844

Session details: Long-lived robotic missions have documented many
active surface processes on Mars, including slope, impact, aeolian, and
polar processes. These data are now producing insights into landscape
evolution over longer timescales. Examples include formation of
complex gullied slopes, carbon-dioxide-driven erosion of south polar
terrains (including "spiders"), dune field evolution and implications
for erosion of layered sediments, steep polar scarps with seasonal
avalanches, and new impact events causing dust avalanches. Of special
interest due to the possible role of water are recurring slope lineae
(RSL), with characteristic associated morphologies such as small
gullies or channels, sandy fans, and slumps. There are also better
constraints on the rates of other processes, such as ice sublimation
and glacial flow in the middle latitudes and tectonic activity. Rovers
and landers provide important in situ measurements supporting orbital
monitoring. We invite submissions documenting active surface change or
assessing current landscape evolution on longer timescales.

AGU SESSION: NATURE, DISTRIBUTION AND EVOLUTION OF ORGANIC MATTER IN
THE SOLAR SYSTEM

Organic matter is critical for habitability of an extraterrestrial
environment and the development of life. It is believed that life on
Earth arose from a chemical complexification of simple organic
molecules, yet many questions remain about the nature and origin of
these building blocks for life. Understanding the chemical processes
that occur in the varied environments of the solar system (e.g. Ocean
Worlds, Mars, comets, meteorites), and investigating the nature,
abundance and distribution of those molecules, give insights on the
processes that occurred on primitive Earth. It also provides valuable
information on the habitability and potential for life throughout the
solar system.

We invite contributions that include (1) remote or in situ observations
of organic matter on planetary bodies, (2) field work, experimental and
modeling studies that could predict organics distribution in planetary
environments, and (3) promising locations, instrument concepts and
strategies for investigating organic astrochemistry.

AGU SESSION: FROM THE EARTH TO THE MOONS: ICE-OCEAN SYSTEMS ON EARTH
AND OCEAN WORLDS

We're excited to invite abstracts for our session "From the Earth to
the Moons: Ice-ocean systems on Earth and Ocean Worlds" (P014).

We had a great turnout and valuable cross-disciplinary discussions last
year and look forward to doing so again in New Orleans!

We're seeking a wide range of terrestrial glaciology/oceanography and
planetary research to foster the Earth-planetary connection,
specifically focusing on the geological, glaciological and
oceanographic aspects of Ocean Worlds and their analogues. Bringing
together Earth and planetary studies to foster interdisciplinary
collaboration and broaden understanding is the aim of this session! We
welcome contributions regarding sea ice; glaciers and ice shelves; icy
satellites and small bodies; analog studies; field work,
in-situ/remotely-sensed observations; experimental and/or modeling
projects on ice/ice-water regimes; impact of melt beneath or within
ice; coupled ice-ocean physical and circulation models; and beyond!

We look forward to seeing you at AGU!

AGU SPECIAL SESSION: PLANETARY SPATIAL DATA INFRASTRUCTURE

11-15 December 2017
New Orleans, LA

Abstract submission is now open for a special session on Planetary
Spatial Data Infrastructure (PSDI) at:

https://agu.confex.com/agu/fm17/preliminaryview.cgi/Session26632

Spatial Data Infrastructures (SDIs) support data analysis and research
using in situ and remotely sensed spatial data. The concept of an
infrastructure is to enable users to (1) efficiently discover data, (2)
experience improved data integration and usage and (3) engage in
collaborative research through integrated research environments. SDIs
have been developed for a wide range of topics using a myriad of
technologies.

The special session is soliciting abstracts focusing on best practices
for creating and managing spatial data infrastructure frameworks for
processing, analyzing, visualizing, serving and sharing Planetary
science spatial data.

SCIENTIFIC PROGRAMMER, UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND

The Small Bodies Node (SBN) of NASA's Planetary Data System, based in
the Department of Astronomy at the University of Maryland, College
Park, is seeking a programmer with analytic experience who would work
with a larger group of planetary scientists and programmers. The ideal
candidate will also work closely with programmers at the Minor Planet
Center at the Center for Astrophysics, Cambridge, MA, concerned with
small body astronomy and orbital calculation. 5 years experience is
required, including some system administration experience or training,
and with some experience either designing or implementing IT security
measures in a Linux network environment. A familiarity with relational
database management is also desired. A Bachelor's or Master's level
degree in computer science or a related field is prefered, but previous
work experience will also be considered. Near-term tasks include
developing a cross-identification database for all bodies represented
in the archive, overseeing the security plan for the SBN, back-end
development and user interface development, and reporting to NASA.

LSST SOLAR SYSTEM SCIENCE COLLABORATION

Over its 10 year lifespan, the Large Synoptic Sky Survey Telescope
(LSST) will catalog over 5 million Main Belt asteroids, almost 300,000
Jupiter Trojans, over 100,000 NEOs, over 40,000 KBOs, and over 10,000
comets. Many of these objects will receive hundreds of observations in
multiple bandpasses. The LSST Solar System Science Collaboration (SSSC)
is preparing methods and tools to analyze this data, as well as
understand optimum survey strategies for discovering moving objects
throughout the Solar System.

The SSSC launched a new website. Check it out at:

http://www.lsstsssc.org

and please consider joining the collaboration if you're an eligible
researcher.

images ever assembled in one volume. With explanatory captions in 24
languages and a gallery of more than 200 images from HiRISE, this
distinctive volume underscores the need for such a camera on future
orbiters, especially as more landing missions are planned. Mars: The
Pristine Beauty of the Red Planet provides a stunning keepsake of one
of humanity's greatest accomplishments in space travel.
