AOGS 2023 SESSION: ASTROCHEMICAL PROCESSES LEADING TO THE FORMATION OF 
PLANETARY BODIES IN THE SOLAR SYSTEM

The Annual Meeting of the Asia Oceania Geosciences Society will be 
held in Singapore on July 30 - August 4, 2023. Our session intends 
to bring together researchers in the fields of planetary science, 
astrophysics, astrochemistry, and atmospheric science whose work 
focuses on the study of molecular interactions towards the formation 
of organic compounds in planetary environments, including comets, 
asteroids, planetary object (planets, dwarf planets, and moons) 
surfaces, and planetary object atmospheres. This also includes studies 
covering the formation of simple chemical precursors up to larger and 
more complex macromolecular organic compounds.

Research areas that are encouraged include, but are not limited to, 
all spectral ranges of laboratory investigations, particle and 
radiation, interaction with all phases of matter including ices and 
tholins, and theoretical and laboratory cross sections and reaction 
rates.

Experimentalists, observers, theorists, and modelers are all 
encouraged to present their work, further discuss emerging ideas and 
insights on planetary science, astrophysics, and astrochemistry.

Deadline for abstract submission: February 14, 2023.
Notification announcements: March 21-28, 2023.

JOB OPENING: SENIOR SCIENTIST FOR ASTROBIOLOGY AT NASA HEADQUARTERS, 
WASHINGTON, DC

NASA leads the world in Astrobiology research and exploration and is 
preparing for the discovery of life elsewhere by nurturing 
multidisciplinary research, developing exciting space missions to 
explore habitable worlds, and by cooperating with partners nationally 
and internationally for the benefit of humankind. Astrobiology is a 
scientific discipline devoted to the study of life in the universe - 
its origin, evolution, future, and distribution.

This appointment will be for a period of up to 6 years under the NASA 
Excepted Hiring Authority (NEX) and is open only to U.S. Citizens.

The incumbent serves as the Agency's Senior Leader in Astrobiology 
leading efforts from NASA Headquarters to ensure significant progress 
is made in Astrobiology. This position will ensure coordination and 
collaboration across SMD Divisions and between research programs and 
mission planning.

NASA POSTDOCTORAL PROGRAM

The NASA Postdoctoral Program offers US and international scientists 
the opportunity to advance their research while contributing to NASA's 
scientific goals. The NPP supports fundamental science; explores the 
undiscovered; promotes intellectual growth; and encourages scientific 
connections. 

Selected by a competitive peer-review process, NPP Fellows complete 
one- to three-year Fellowship appointments that advance NASA's 
missions in Earth science, planetary science, heliophysics, 
astrophysics, biological and physical science, aeronautics and 
engineering, human exploration systems, space operations, space 
technology, and astrobiology. 

Search for NPP research opportunities in planetary science here:

https://npp.orau.org/applicants/opportunities.html 

Applicants must have a Ph.D. or equivalent degree in hand before 
beginning the fellowship, but may apply while completing the degree 
requirements. Please see current eligibility requirements:

https://npp.orau.org/applicants/eligibility.html

Stipends start at $70,000 per year, with supplements for higher 
cost-of-living areas and for certain academic specialties. Financial 
assistance is available for relocation and health insurance, and 
$10,000 per year is provided for travel and professional development.

Applications are accepted three times each year: March 1, July 1, and 
November 1.

POSTDOCTORAL POSITION IN COSMIC ICE ASTROCHEMISTRY

Applications are now being accepted for a Postdoctoral Research
Associate to join The Cosmic Ice Laboratory at NASA/GSFC in Greenbelt,
MD. The position consists of a postdoctoral appointment at the
University of Maryland, Baltimore County and funded by NASA through
CRESST II. The successful applicant will join The Cosmic Ice Laboratory
and focus on investigating the radiolytic stability of organic
compounds under conditions relevant to dense clouds or icy Solar
System bodies. The successful candidate will perform radiation
chemistry experiments on ices at low temperatures in vacuum, using a
proton accelerator as the radiation source.

Candidates for the position must have a Ph.D. in chemistry, physics,
or related field by the date of the appointment and should be within
five years of the receipt of their doctoral degree. Ideally,
candidates will have experience with the following: cryo-vacuum
apparatuses, radiation chemistry, and infrared spectroscopy.

Complete applications received by December 31, 2022, will receive
full consideration.

Candidates should send a cover letter, CV (including publication
list), a 3-page statement of research interests, and contact
information for three references via email to Ms. Katherine McKee
(katherine.s.mckee@nasa.gov). The position will remain available until
filled.

Additionally, proposals that support the acquisition and/or analysis 
of scientific data from ground-based telescopes are solicited. Such 
ground-based programs must directly support the analysis and/or 
interpretation of TESS scientific data. Observations associated with 
TESS GI Cycle 6 will be executed from September 2023 until October 
2024, covering observing sectors 70 - 83. Proposals are solicited for 
targets in Northern Ecliptic Hemisphere fields and in fields along on 
the ecliptic plane.

ROSES-2022 Amendment 79 releases final text and due dates for D.10 
TESS GI. Phase-1 proposals are due 4:30 pm April 14, 2023, via the 
Astrophysics Research Knowledgebase Remote Proposal System at:

https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/ark/rps/

On or about December 19, 2022, this Amendment will be posted at:

TRANSIENT ASTRONOMY SATELLITE PARTICIPATING SCIENTISTS PROGRAM

Ultraviolet Transient Astronomy Satellite Participating Scientists 
Program (D.19 ULTRASAT PSP) solicits proposals for U.S. based 
researchers to join the ULTRASAT science team as Participating 
Scientists. Selected Participating Scientists will pursue science 
investigations related to ULTRASAT and will contribute to the mission 
by joining one or more topical ULTRASAT science working groups, where 
they will help develop, coordinate, and implement research plans for 
the corresponding science area. Successful proposals are expected to 
describe one or more specific research questions to be answered using 
the unique capabilities of ULTRASAT.

Notices of intent are strongly encouraged by January 23, 2023, and 
proposals are due March 31, 2023.

This program element differs from and supersedes the default rules in 
the ROSES Summary of Solicitation and the Guidebook in a number of 
ways; please see the Amendment for details.

This program will evaluate proposals using dual-anonymous peer review.

On or about December 23, 2022, this Amendment will be posted to:
