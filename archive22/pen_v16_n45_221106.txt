This month's topic is 'Topographically influenced evolution of 
large-scale changes in the smooth terrains of comet 
67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko' contributed by Abhinav Jindal, Department 
of Astronomy, Cornell University, USA.

PH.D. POSITION IN EXO-(PLANETARY) SCIENCE AT UNIVERSITY OF CENTRAL 
FLORIDA

Prof. Ramses Ramirez is seeking a qualified Ph.D. student to join his 
research team within the UCF Planetary Sciences Group (Department of 
Physics) in either the Spring 2023 or Fall 2023 semesters.

The qualified candidate will work with Prof. Ramirez and develop an 
original project to model the atmospheres of potentially habitable 
exoplanets or Solar System worlds. Theoretical projects involving 
climate, atmospheric escape, photochemistry or atmospheric-surface 
interactions (among other topics) are all welcome.

Programming experience is a must. Highly-motivated individuals with 
relevant astronomy, planetary science, geoscience, or engineering 
backgrounds are particularly encouraged to apply.

UCF offers a rigorous research program in Planetary Sciences, where 
students are paired with Ph.D. advisors upon admission. We offer robust 
academic and research mentoring programs and have strong ties to the 
Florida Space Institute, Arecibo, and the NASA Kennedy Space Center.

More information about Prof. Ramirez and the Planetary Sciences Group 
(plus Ph.D. program), respectively, can be found here:

EGU23 SESSION GM10.1/PS1: PLANETARY GEOMORPHOLOGY

Please consider submitting an abstract to the session on Planetary 
Geomorphology (GM10.1/PS1) at the EGU General Assembly 2023. EGU 
(23-28 April 2023) will be a hybrid event facilitating online and 
in-person participation in Vienna. 

Please note the approaching deadline (1 December, 13:00 CET) for 
those seeking travel support.

The Planetary Geomorphology session aims to bring together 
geomorphologists who study the Earth with those who work on other 
bodies such as Mars, Venus, Mercury, the Moon, icy satellites of the 
outer Solar System, comets, and/or asteroids. Studies applicable to 
landscapes on any scale on any solid body are welcome. We particularly 
encourage those who use Earth analogues, laboratory/numerical 
simulation and/or big satellite datasets to submit their work. 
Considered processes could include aeolian, volcanic, tectonic, 
fluvial, glacial, periglacial, or "undetermined" ones. We especially 
welcome contributions from early-career scientists and geomorphologists 
who are new to planetary science.

Session details: 

https://meetingorganizer.copernicus.org/EGU23/session/47063

Abstract instructions: 

https://egu23.eu/programme/how_to_submit.html

The abstract deadline is 10 January 2023 (13:00 CET), but those seeking 
travel support should submit their abstract by 1 December 2022 
(13:00 CET). 

Best wishes,

Planetary Geomorphology convenors: 

Lonneke Roelofs, Stephen Brough, Frances Butcher, Tjalling de Haas, and 
Nikolaus J. Kuhn

EGU23 SESSION PS4.1: ATMOSPHERES AND EXOSPHERES OF TERRESTRIAL PLANETS,
SATELLITES, AND EXOPLANETS

We are pleased to announce that the abstract submission is open for EGU 
2023, held in Vienna on 23-28 April 2023 and online.

The deadline for the abstract submission is 10 January 2023, 13:00 CET 
or before 1 December 2022, 13:00 CET to apply for travel support.

We would like to draw your attention to our session: Atmospheres and 
exospheres of terrestrial planets, satellites, and exoplanets.

This session primarily focuses on the neutral atmospheres of 
terrestrial bodies other than the Earth. This includes not only Venus 
and Mars, but also exoplanets with comparable envelopes and satellites 
carrying dense atmospheres such as Titan or exospheres such as 
Ganymede. We welcome contributions dealing with processes affecting the 
atmospheres of these bodies, from the surface to the exosphere. We 
invite abstracts concerning observations, both from Earth or from 
space, modeling and theoretical studies, or laboratory work. 
Comparative planetology abstracts will be particularly appreciated.

If you consider submitting an abstract in this session, you can use the 
following link:

Hope to see you in Vienna!

Best regards,

The conveners,

Arnaud Beth, Arianna Piccialli, and Audrey Vorburger

RESEARCH FACULTY POSITION IN PLANETARY SCIENCES, UNIVERSITY OF 
WASHINGTON

The Department of Earth and Space Sciences at the University of
Washington invites applications for a full-time Research Assistant
Professor in planetary sciences. The successful candidate will be
expected to engage in research on the geology and/or geophysics of
planetary bodies. We are particularly interested in candidates whose
research involves experimental and theoretical work involving
high-pressure processes on icy planets, moons, and exoplanets.
Involvement in planetary missions is a plus. The position will involve
taking a leadership role in advising and mentoring graduate students in
our program. Teaching opportunities may arise in the form of lectures,
seminars, mentoring, and lab instruction.

For more information, and to apply, see: 

https://apply.interfolio.com/116028

Please direct any questions to essasst@uw.edu. Applications will be
reviewed starting December 1, 2022. Application documents received
after this date may be considered at the discretion of the search
committee.
