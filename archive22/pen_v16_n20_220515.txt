[NASA] FINAL TEXT FOR F.2 TOPICAL WORKSHOPS, SYMPOSIA, AND CONFERENCES

Through Topical Workshops, Symposia, and Conferences (TWSC F.12 of
ROSES), the Science Mission Directorate (SMD) solicits proposals for 
events, including asynchronous and virtual workshops, Open Source
Science Initiatives, etc., that contribute to SMD's equity, science,
technology and exploration goals. Because there is no central or
dedicated TWSC funding, proposal submission requires designation of at
least one reviewing program, division or office. Proposals that are
relevant to more than one part of SMD also are welcome. Awards may be
grants, cooperative agreements, intra-NASA transfers, or inter-agency
agreements, as appropriate.

As a no due date or rolling submissions competition, TWSC proposals may 
be submitted at any time through May 12, 2023.

TWSC does not accept Notices of Intent, but potential proposers must
confirm the event's topical relevancy and availability of funds before
preparing or submitting a proposal to one or more SMD program officer
listed at:

https://science.nasa.gov/researchers/sara/program-officers-list

This Amendment will be posted on the NASA research opportunity 
homepage at:

https://solicitation.nasaprs.com/ROSES2022

[NASA] ROSES-22 AMENDMENT 17: F.4 HABITABLE WORLDS STEP-2 DUE DATE 
DELAY

The goal of the Habitable Worlds program is to use knowledge of the
history of the Earth and the life upon it as a guide for determining
the processes and conditions that create and maintain habitable
environments (including transient environments) and to search for
ancient and contemporary habitable environments and explore the
possibility of extant life beyond the Earth.

ROSES-2022 Amendment 17 delays the due date for Step-2 proposals for
F.4 Habitable Worlds (HW) to February 3, 2023. The due date for HW
Step-1 proposals remains November 8, 2022.

This Amendment will be posted on the NASA research opportunity 
homepage at: 

https://solicitation.nasaprs.com/ROSES2022

Questions concerning F.4 HW may be directed to Becky McCauley Rench at
rebecca.l.mccauleyrench@nasa.gov.

[NASA] CALL FOR PEER REVIEW PANELISTS: SPACE GRANT K-12 INCLUSIVENESS 
AND DIVERSITY IN STEM (SG KIDS)

NASA Research and Education Support Services (NRESS) is seeking persons
willing to serve as peer reviewers for the Space Grant K-12
Inclusiveness and Diversity in STEM (SG KIDS) program element listed
under Engagement Opportunities in NASA STEM 2022 the ENGAGEMENT
OPPORTUNITIES IN NASA STEM (EONS-2022). Information about the
opportunity, proposal requirements and evaluation criteria can be found
on the NASA SG KIDS solicitation landing page.  

A virtual panel is now scheduled for June 21-24, 2022. Each proposal is
approximately 10 pages in length and every effort will be made to
assign no more than 5 proposals to each panelist. The duration of the
panel might change depending on the number of proposals being reviewed,
but for scheduling purposes, plan on a full-day commitment for all four
days.

Non-federal civil servant panelists will receive a $200 honorarium for
each day panel is in session.

Please register by May 20, 2022. 

https://forms.gle/J54hUdoNESWhxARVA

Reviewers will be selected based on the subject matter of each proposal 
received. You will only be contacted if you are selected to 
participate.

The International Commission on Planetary Atmospheres and Evolution
(ICPAE), which is one of the commissions of the International
Association of Meteorology and Atmospheric Sciences (IAMAS), organizes
a monthly webinar. The primary objective of our webinar series is to
provide researchers with updates on new findings and techniques on
planetary atmospheres from across the world.

DAVINCI IN SITU CAPABILITY ROUNDTABLE

DAVINCI (Deep Atmosphere Venus Investigation of Noble gases, Chemistry,
and Imaging) will host a virtual community meeting on July 28, 2022. 
Within the capabilities of its atmospheric probe, DAVINCI carries an in
situ analytical suite. The DAVINCI team is evaluating options and
science justification to include one additional atmospheric gas target
to its suite of laser-capable measurements for high precision analysis
during descent (details provided in included link), and we welcome
input from the scientific community. We invite applications to join a
conversation with the DAVINCI Science Team to discuss scientific
drivers and hypotheses for a set of candidate atmospheric gases.

Please note that participation in this meeting does not grant DAVINCI
team membership and the decision for selection and/or inclusion of an
additional gas target is the sole responsibility of the DAVINCI
project.  

We are excited for the opportunity to engage the science community and
the expertise and energy of fellow Venusians, to provide an avenue to
contribute to the science capabilities of this long-awaited and
long-overdue in situ probe mission.

Please submit an indication of interest through the following website
by 11:59pm PDT, May 20, 2022:

EPSC SESSION SB7: LABORATORY MEASUREMENTS OF RETURNED HAYABUSA2
SAMPLES, METEORITES AND PLANETARY ANALOGUES

Abstract deadline: May 18, 13:00 CEST

https://meetingorganizer.copernicus.org/EPSC2022/session/44654

This session aims to highlight recent laboratory results of Hayabusa2
returned (162173) Ryugu's samples including curative work, preliminary
initial analysis and preparatory work for future joint work.

It focuses as well on new challenges and the missing building blocks
needed to understand the composition and physical properties of the
material of primitive bodies, using laboratory work on meteorites or
other available extraterrestrial materials as well as terrestrial
reference materials (rocks, minerals, ice, organics). Results of these
laboratory studies with relevant references to modelling early
processes in the Solar System, including the formation/evolution of
small bodies, and in support of ongoing and planned missions to study
these objects are welcome.

Addressing early Solar System processes, the session also welcomes
laboratory studies related to origin of inorganic and organic matter in
different astrophysical environments and contributions on laboratory
investigations and models of parent bodies of various meteorite groups,
IDPs, asteroids, comets and dwarf planets.

Conveners: Enrica Bonato, Lydie Bonal, Gabriele Arnold, Eric Quirico,
Jorn Helbert, Shogo Tachibana, Tomohiro Usui, Tomoki Nakamura

PHD POSITION ON CRYOVOLCANISM ON CERES AT MPI FOR SOLAR SYSTEM
RESEARCH, GERMANY

The PhD project is intended to search for further signs of
cryo-volcanism on the surface of Ceres by using newly calibrated Dawn
Framing Camera color imaging data of unprecedented accuracy. The main
goal is to help understand whether a global brine layer at about 40 km
depth at the crust-mantle boundary exists and whether cryo-volcanic
activity is a past or also a present phenomenon on dwarf planet Ceres.
For details, see:
