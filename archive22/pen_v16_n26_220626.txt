SAVE THE DATE: 1ST WORKSHOP ON ICES IN THE SOLAR SYSTEM

We are excited to announce the first in a potential series of workshops
on Ices in the Solar System, "A Volatile-Excursion from Mercury and the
Moon to the Kuiper Belt and Beyond". The workshop is scheduled for
January 9-11, 2023, at Dawson College in Montreal, QC, CA.

The workshop aims to fuse a diverse group of early-, mid-, and
senior-career planetary scientists whose work focuses on Ices, and
provide a dynamic platform for presenting and exchanging their most
current observations, interpretations, hypotheses, and/or explanations.
Discussion of mission-exploration plans and options, current and/or
proposed, also would be welcomed.

A complimentary meet-and-greet reception will take place off-campus on
January 8. The location and time of the reception will be announced at
a later date.

To be added to the mailing list to receive additional information about
this workshop, submit an indication of interest:

PHD POSITION IN SPACE RESEARCH/MASS SPECTROMETRY AT UNIVERSITY OF BERN,
SWITZERLAND

Comet Interceptor (CI), the new F-class mission of the European Space
Agency, is currently under development to fly past a pristine comet.
The University of Bern is the lead institute of the mass spectrometer
suite MANiaC (Mass Analyzer for Neutrals in a Coma) which is dedicated
to the investigation of the gas coma surrounding the comet's nucleus.

The PhD contains both theoretical and lab work as well as the study of
comets and spacecraft instrumentation. The project focuses on the
characterization of the MANiaC time-of-flight mass spectrometer and
pressure/density gauge. The work includes testing of the ion-optical
design, ion source, detector, and characterization of the different
instrument models and subunits of MANiaC.

The position requires a Master of Science degree in physics or a
closely related field in engineering. Experience in instrumentation,
lab work, and programming languages are an advantage. Interested
applicants should send their curriculum vitae (including professional
experience), a one-page motivation letter, the contact details of two
reference persons, and grades obtained at the Master level to Dr.
Martin Rubin (martin.rubin@unibe.ch).

PHD POSITION: EXPERIMENTAL SPACE RESEARCH

The Space Research and Planetology Division, University of Bern,
Switzerland, is seeking a PhD student to join the group for the JUICE
mission to Jupiter and its icy moons. We are participating in the JUICE
mission with a neutral gas and ion mass spectrometer (NIM), which will
measure the chemical composition of the atmospheres of Jupiter's icy
moons: Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto. Experience with electronics,
measurement techniques, vacuum instrumentation, ion-optical simulation,
and mass spectrometry would be of advantage. Several tests, and
calibrations with the flight spare instrument and the ground reference
instrument are planned, using fast neutral beams and low-energy ion
beams.

The position is available beginning 1 October 2022. Candidates with
demonstrated experience in experimental work will be favoured. The
salary is in accordance with the personnel regulations of the Canton of
Bern. Submit your application by 29 July 2022 as a single pdf file
consisting of a cover letter describing your motivation and
qualifications for the position, a CV, list of your publications, and
names of three references.

Los Alamos National Laboratory is seeking a highly motivated scientific
and engineering leader with expertise and experience in remote sensing,
data science, and space research. ISR-6 develops and deploys
sophisticated and customized detection systems and analysis tools to
address needs in our key mission areas of nuclear non-proliferation,
space domain awareness, atmospheric science, planetary science and
exploration, and multi-source intelligence. To develop and deploy these
tailored solutions, we leverage our core capabilities in:

- spectral, spatial, and temporal sensing (acoustic, optical, infrared, 
  RF, and x-rays); 
- source phenomenology modeling, interpretation, and
  propagation; 
- data analysis, algorithm development and machine learning;
- detector and system design, development, and deployment (ground,
  airborne and space-based platforms).

Our portfolio includes high impact scientific efforts such as the
ChemCam and SuperCam experiments on NASA's Curiosity and Perseverance
rovers, NASA's NACHOS hyperspectral cubesat missions, the RAPid
Telescopes for Optical Response (RAPTOR) which is an array of
"thinking" telescopes for time-domain astronomy, ultra-low light
imaging systems such as the Remote Ultra-low Light Imaging (RULLI)
system.
