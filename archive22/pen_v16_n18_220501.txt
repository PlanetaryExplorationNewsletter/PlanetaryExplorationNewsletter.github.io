SMALL BODIES ASSESSMENT GROUP (SBAG) STEERING COMMITTEE POSITIONS OPEN

Three positions are open for the Steering Committee of the Small Bodies 
Assessment Group (SBAG), with three-year terms starting in August 2022.

The Committee organizes SBAG meetings, writes the official SBAG 
findings, and takes a leadership role in other activities where 
community input on topics of interest is needed.

In addition to a member in Planetary Defense who works to understand 
the population of small bodies that may impact our planet, we seek two 
at-large members in any area of small body research at any career 
stage.

The application requires: 1) a two-page CV, including a description of 
participation in SBAG or other small bodies organizations, and 2) a 
short (300 words maximum) statement of interest. Criteria for selection 
are: participation in small bodies community organizations, leadership 
experience, and relevant research or mission experience.

In support of diversity, applicants may specify gender, whether they 
belong to an underrepresented group in STEM, or other additional 
relevant information.

Send applications to Bonnie Buratti (bonnie.buratti@jpl.nasa.gov) by 
May 6, 2022, 8:00 PM EDT. New members will be announced at the 27th 
Meeting of SBAG, June 7-9, 2022.

EPSC SESSION OPE5: OUTER PLANET MOONS

EPSC abstract deadline is May 18, 13:00 CEST and we would like to draw 
your attention to our session OPS5 "Outer planet moons: Environments 
and interactions".

The aim of this session is to discuss our current understanding on the 
environments of the outer planet moons and their interactions with the 
surrounding electromagnetic fields and particles and to discuss the 
pathway for upcoming and future explorations. This session covers 
contributions on all the outer planet moons from a variety of topics 
including (but not limited to) the magnetic field generation, 
subsurface ocean detection from fields and particles, active processes 
(e.g., volcanoes and plumes) and their interactions with the 
surrounding environments and detections, neutral atmosphere, 
ionosphere, aurora, plasma and dust environment, moon-ring systems, 
and moon-magnetosphere interaction. Contributions based on 
observations (both from space and from the ground), modelling, 
theoretical interpretation and supporting laboratory experiments and 
concepts for future spacecraft missions are welcome. Here is the link 
to the session for abstract submission:

EPSC SESSION SB5: TOOLS FOR CHARACTERIZING PLANETARY AND SMALL BODIES 
SURFACES, ATMOSPHERES, AND DUST PARTICLES (IMAGERY, PHOTOMETRY, 
SPECTROSCOPY, SPECTROPHOTOPOLARIMETRY)

The Europlanet Science Congress (EPSC) 2022 - in person

https://www.epsc2022.eu/

Conveners: Oleksandra Ivanova, Frederic Schmidt
Co-conveners: Stefano Bagnulo, Ludmilla Kolokolova, Johannes Markkanen, 
Olga Munoz, Olivier Poch, A. Chantal Levasseur-Regourd, Stephane Erard, 
Antti Penttila, Maria Gritsevich

Electromagnetic scattering phenomena play a key role in determining the 
properties of Solar System objects based on observations using 
different techniques and in a variety of wavelengths ranging from the 
ultraviolet to the radio. This session will promote a general 
advancement in the exploitation of observational and experimental 
techniques to characterize complex particulate media. We particularly 
welcome discussions of future perspectives in the utilization of 
observational and experimental techniques to characterize small bodies 
surfaces in the context of new missions like Comet Interceptor, and 
also the planetary aerosols and dust in the Solar System.

Abstracts are solicited on progress in observational, numerical, and 
laboratory methods to extract relevant information from imagery, 
photometry, polarimetry and spectroscopy in solid phase, reference 
laboratory databases, photometric and polarimetric modeling, software 
and web service applications.

Abstract submission deadline is May 18, 2022, 13:00 CEST.

MEPAG 39 LIGHTNING TALK SIGN-UPS EXTENDED TO APRIL 29, 2022

A significant portion of the meeting will be dedicated to strategic 
planning for the Mars program. We are asking the broader community to 
actively participate in these discussions and encourage you to make 
your voice heard in a 3-5 minute lightning talk (1-4 slides) on Day 1 
of the meeting. Both in-person and virtual attendees will be able to 
participate in breakout discussions following lightning talks. 
Lightning talk sign up will close Friday, April 29th, 2022. Please sign 
up using the following form: 

https://forms.gle/rQNsDiH2PfvqSqxJ6

For in-person attendees, there will be space to hang posters, slide 
printouts, or other material for discussion during the breakout 
discussion on Day 1. Please bring any material you think would enhance 
those discussions.
