PLANETARY SCIENCE DECADAL TOWN HALL AT THE 2022 AGU FALL MEETING

o---------------------------------------------------------------------o

The Planetary Science and Astrobiology Decadal Survey Town Hall at the 
2022 AGU Fall Meeting, originally conflicting with the Planetary 
Sciences Reception on Tuesday, 13 December has been moved.

The Decadal Town Hall will now take place at 6:30 pm on Wednesday, 
14 December in McCormick Place Room S105d (South, Level 1).

https://agu.confex.com/agu/fm22/meetingapp.cgi/Session/161152

If you are attending the Fall Meeting, please consider attending this 
Town Hall. Unlike past events, where the focus has been on informing 
the audience about what the Decadal Survey said, the AGU Town Hall will 
be an attempt to give a preliminary accounting of what actions have 
been taken so far to implement some of the Survey's recommendations.

Best wishes,

Michael Mischna, AGU Planetary Sciences Section President
Paul Byrne, AGU Planetary Sciences Section President-Elect
