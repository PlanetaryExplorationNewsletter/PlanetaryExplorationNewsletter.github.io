CRPG-NANCY (FRANCE): POSTDOC OPPORTUNITY IN ISOTOPE GEOCHEMISTRY OF 
PLANETARY MANTLES

The CRPG-Nancy (France) seeks to appoint a 2 years postdoctoral 
research assistant within the isotope geochemistry group. The main goal 
of the project is the study of novel siderophile and volatile elements 
and their stable isotope composition in the Earth's mantle and crust, 
and in planetary silicate reservoirs, aiming at improving our knowledge 
on the conditions of mantle formation and evolution from the earliest 
stages of Solar System history to the present.

The position will involve state-of-the-art chemistry and MC-ICPMS 
isotopic analyses of mantle and crustal samples from the Earth and 
planetary bodies, and data interpretation in order to define models of 
isotopic fractionation relevant to the thermodynamic conditions of 
planet differentiation. The successful applicant will work in close 
collaboration with Dr. Beatrice Luais at the CRPG, Dr. Mickael Toplis 
at IRAP-Toulouse, Prof. M. Humayun (Florida State University).

Required qualifications: PhD in Earth and Planetary Sciences, strong 
knowledge in cosmochemistry/planetology, elemental and isotope 
geochemistry, and specific skills and rigor in clean laboratory 
chemistry and isotopic analyses using MC-ICP-MS techniques. Very good 
level of fluency in English and good writing quality required. Details:

ESA ARCHIVAL RESEARCH VISITOR PROGRAMME

To increase the scientific return from its space science missions, the
European Space Agency (ESA) welcomes applications from scientists
interested in pursuing research projects based on data publicly 
available in the ESA Space Science Archives.

The ESA Archival Research Visitor Programme is open to scientists, at 
all career levels, affiliated with institutes in ESA Member States and
Collaborating States. Early-career scientists, including PhD students, 
are particularly encouraged to apply.

During their stay, visiting scientists will have access to archives and
mission specialists for help with the retrieval, calibration, and 
analysis of archival data. In principle, all areas of space research 
covered by ESA science missions can be supported.

Residence lasts typically between one and three months, also 
distributed over multiple visits. Research projects can be carried out 
at ESAC (Madrid, Spain) and at ESTEC (Noordwijk, Netherlands). To 
offset the expenses incurred by visitors, ESA covers travel costs and 
provides support for lodging expenses and meals.

Applications received before 1 November 2022 will be considered for 
visits in Spring and Summer 2023.

information, please refer to:

THE ROAD TO MISSION SCIENCE: SEMINARS FOR STUDENTS AND EARLY CAREER 
RESEARCHERS

The Lunar and Planetary Institute is hosting webinars for those who 
have an interest in becoming involved in current or future planetary 
science missions. Undergraduate and graduate students, postdocs, and 
early career scientists are invited to join us for a discussion of how 
to prepare for a career in mission science.

The virtual event will feature a panel of mentors and mission 
scientists representing active and upcoming planetary missions. 
Panelists will share their backgrounds, experiences, and 
recommendations. Participants will be encouraged to ask questions and 
make connections with mission scientists. We will describe planetary 
missions, discuss mission science careers, and highlight relevant 
opportunities for students and early career scientists.

The next event will be a 90-minute virtual seminar on Thursday, 
September 15, at 3 PM EDT / 2 PM CDT / 1 PM MDT / 12 PM PDT.

EPSC 2022 SPLINTER WORKSHOP ON MARTIAN ORBITAL DATA COMBINATIONS

The Planetary Surface Portal (PSUP) is organizing a splinter workshop 
during EPSC 2022 dedicated to the combination of Martian Orbital Data. 
A demo of the tools offered by PSUP tool named MarsSI will be offered: 

https://marssi.univ-lyon1.fr

MarsSI provides both a way to explore and use data from space agencies'
archives, such as the Planetary Data System (PDS), but also run data 
processing pipelines to produce corrected and map-projected data set, 
ready to be used in Geographic Information System for analyzes. Optical 
images (e.g., HiRISE or CTX), hyperspectral data cubes (OMEGA and 
CRISM) are available. MarsSI allows also the processing of both CTX and 
HiRISE Digital Elevation Models on demand. A demo of QGIS by managing 
MarsSI output products will also be proposed.

The workshop will be held Tuesday, 20 Sep, 15:30-17:00 (CEST) at Room 
Splinter Sala de Prensa:

IAVCEI 2023 SESSION ON VOLCANOTECTONIC PROCESSES AND LANDFORMS ACROSS 
THE SOLAR SYSTEM 

We are pleased to announce a session on planetary volcanotectonics at 
the IAVCEI Scientific Assembly in Rotorua, New Zealand, 30 January to
3 February 2023.

Volcanic and tectonic activity are hallmarks of almost every large 
solid-surface body in the Solar System. In this session, we solicit 
contributions exploring the myriad styles of volcanic eruptions, the 
architecture of plumbing systems, and volcanotectonic landforms and 
processes on Solar System bodies (planets, moons, or asteroids) using 
field observations, remotely sensed data, laboratory or numerical 
simulations, or some combination thereof. We especially welcome 
submissions of comparative analyses between volcanotectonics on Earth 
and on other worlds, or between other planetary bodies.

To submit an abstract for this session, visit:

https://confer.eventsair.com/iavcei2023/cfp

The submission deadline is this coming Friday, 9 September 2022 at 
10:00 AM Eastern time. 

We look forward to seeing you there!
