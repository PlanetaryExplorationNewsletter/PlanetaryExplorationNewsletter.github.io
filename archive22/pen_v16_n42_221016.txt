EDITORIAL: LET'S GO TO TRITON IN NEW FRONTIERS 5

Dear Colleagues,

The draft AO for NF5 is out and Curt Niebur has requested comments by
October 31. We have written a letter to Curt advocating for a Triton
mission to be added to the NF5 list. We are basing this on the fact
that the new Ocean, Worlds, and Life decadal survey prioritized Triton
science highly and put a Triton mission on the NF7 list. NF7 was
selected over NF6 with the expectation of using a Jupiter Gravity 
Assist (JGA) trajectory. NF5 also has JGA available within its range 
of launch dates, without the uncertainty of schedule slips in the 
future that could negate the opportunity for NF7.

We are advocating for the NF7 mission envisioned by OWL to be moved up
to NF5 solely on the basis of the decadal scientific support, not that 
a CAPS process would be required, with associated delays in the NF5 AO
release (the letter to Curt is explicit in that regard).

Please go to this link to read the letter. If you would like to 
endorse it please add your signature.

[NASA] OPAG HYBRID MEETING + LIGHTNING TALK SESSION

The next Outer Planets Assessment Group (OPAG) meeting will be held on 
November 15-16, 2022 as a hybrid meeting, virtually and in Houston, TX. 
OPAG will host a lightning talk session (~3-5 min) on the afternoon of 
Tuesday, November 15. Talks can focus on research, mission concepts, 
technology developments, etc. While open to all, we especially welcome 
talks by students and early career researchers. There will not be an 
official poster session, but poster space will be available for 
lightning talk presenters, in the LPI lobby - for those who would like 
to put up a poster and discuss it during meeting breaks.

OPAG looks forward to providing this opportunity for you to showcase 
your work and network! If you wish to give a lightning talk (virtually 
or in person) please fill out this form by October 24, 2022. If you 
have questions, please contact Kate Craft (Kate.Craft@jhuapl.edu) and 
Kunio Sayanagi (kunio.m.sayanagi@nasa.gov)

There is also opportunity for a limited number of stipends for 
in-person and virtual attendance for students and early careers.

REMINDER: PLANETARY SCIENCE MENTAL HEALTH SURVEY

For those who have not yet filled out the survey. Just a gentle 
reminder (1 month before closing) about the survey:

We would like to invite those associated with the planetary science 
field to participate in our mental health survey of the planetary 
science community. Mental health is an important issue to the general 
population and even in the science community. With this awareness, we 
are surveying our planetary science community to have a better 
understanding of how it is doing.

If you decide to participate, please follow the link below. The survey 
takes about 10-15 minutes and the information generated will be 
anonymous. We appreciate you giving us your valuable time to be 
involved in this important matter. If possible, we ask that you send 
this survey to people within your institution, department, and 
colleagues who are also a part of the planetary science community so 
that we can ensure that everyone is included and heard.

POSTDOCTORAL POSITION ON THE INTERACTION OF DUST AND WATER ICE CLOUDS 
IN THE MARTIAN ATMOSPHERE

The Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, invites
applications for a postdoctoral position on the interaction of dust and
water ice clouds in the Martian atmosphere. The project aims to study 
how the dust and water cycle interaction affects the atmospheric 
temperature structure, circulation, and the transport of trace 
constituents throughout dust storms on present-day Mars. The successful 
candidate will perform numerical simulations of increasing complexity 
using a Mars General Circulation Model in order to study these 
processes and compare the results with observations by the Mars Climate 
Sounder.

Applicants should have a PhD in planetary or atmospheric science or a
related scientific discipline, experience concerning research on the
Martian atmosphere as well as General Circulation Modeling, and 
excellent programming skills.

Postdoctoral Scholar positions are awarded for a minimum of one year 
and may be renewed up to a maximum of three years. Applications should 
be submitted online via this website:

https://tinyurl.com/3ky2p37m

Candidates should submit a CV, representative publications, contact
information for three references, and a cover letter stating their
research accomplishments and interests. Applications received by 
November 4, 2022 will receive full consideration.

System and Beyond will be held on 20-24 March 2023 at ESA-ESTEC, in the 
Netherlands, with the option of online participation. The event's goal 
is to unite the communities involved in our fleet of planetary and 
exoplanetary science missions by exploring their synergies. The covered 
themes, for both Solar System planets and exoplanets, will include:

- Planetary formation & evolution 
- Planetary system architecture, dynamics, stability 
- Interior structure & processes 
- Surface geological & geophysical processes
- Atmospheric dynamics & chemistry 
- Ionospheres, magnetospheres, plasma environment  
- Stellar/solar activity and interaction with planets 
- Habitability & exobiology 

Abstract submission is open and will close on 11 November 2022 for 
contributed talks and on 3 March 2023 for posters. The symposium 
welcomes presentations in all aspects of planetary and exoplanetary 
science, ranging from observation techniques and data analysis to 
interpretation and modelling. We particularly encourage contributions 
exploring the parallels between Solar System planets and their 
extrasolar counterparts.
