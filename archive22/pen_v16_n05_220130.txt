[NASA] ROSES-21: DUE DATES FOR C.30 OSIRIS-REX SAMPLE ANALYSIS
PARTICIPATING SCIENTIST PROGRAM

The objective of C.30 the OSIRIS-REx Sample Analysis Participating
Scientist Program (ORSA-PSP) is to enhance the scientific return during
the sample analysis operational phase of the OSIRIS-REx mission by
expanding participation in the mission through new investigations that
broaden and/or complement existing investigations. Work solicited by
this program element is to enhance, augment, or complement planned
mission activities during the sample-analysis phase of the mission.

On December 17, 2021 the text for C.30 ORSA-PSP was released but the
due dates were TBD. The due dates for proposals have now been set.
Step-1 proposals are due February 28, 2022 and Step-2 proposals are due
April 26, 2022. All of the critical supporting documents are available
for download on the NSPIRES page for this program element:

https://tinyurl.com/yckuu8sm

This Amendment will be posted on the NASA research opportunity homepage 
at: 

https://solicitation.nasaprs.com/ROSES2021

and will appear on SARA's ROSES blog at:

https://science.nasa.gov/researchers/sara/grant-solicitations/roses-2021/

Questions concerning C.30 ORSA-PSP may be directed to Jeffrey N.
Grossman at HQ-OREXPSP@mail.nasa.gov.

[NASA] ROSES-21: APPENDED PLANETARY MAJOR EQUIPMENT AND FACILITIES
PROPOSALS ARE PERMITTED THROUGH THE END OF ROSES-2021

Program element C.17 Planetary Major Equipment and Facilities (PMEF)
Program allows proposers to participating programs supported by the
Planetary Science Division to append a request to acquire or develop
instrumentation to support the PI's research.

See the NSPIRES page for this program element:

https://tinyurl.com/36er5edy

ROSES-2021 Amendment 65 announces that appended Planetary Major
Equipment and Facilities (PMEF) are permitted through the end of
ROSES-2021 to permit those who still plan to submit proposals (e.g., to
a NoDD program) the opportunity to include an appended PMEF proposal
for investigator instruments only. No stand-alone PMEF proposals are
solicited. Those who would have appended a request for an investigator
instrument to their proposal but were not able to do so (those
submitted since Amendment 42 on November 4, 2021) may contact
aaron.burton@nasa.gov.

This Amendment will be posted on the NASA research opportunity homepage 
at:

https://solicitation.nasaprs.com/ROSES2021

and will appear on SARA's ROSES blog at:

https://science.nasa.gov/researchers/sara/grant-solicitations/roses-2021/

[NASA] PDS: MRO CRISM MTRDR AND TER RELEASE 19

PDS announces Release 19 of Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter CRISM Targeted
Empirical Data Record (TER) and Map-projected Targeted Reduced Data
Record (MTRDR) products, at:

https://pds-geosciences.wustl.edu/missions/mro/crism.htm

This release fills in data from February 9, 2010, through December 24,
2011. TER products are image cubes derived from CRISM hyperspectral
targeted observations, post-processed to standardize the illumination
and observation geometry and remove atmospheric gas absorptions and
instrument artifacts. MTRDRs are the same products map-projected using
terrain models of the Martian surface.

COSPAR-22 SESSION: B5.1 - OCEAN WORLDS

We are pleased to announce a session for the COSPAR 44th Scientific
Assembly to be held in Athens, Greece, 16-24 July 2022.

https://www.cosparathens2022.org/

The abstract submission deadline is 11 February 2022.

B5.1: Ocean Worlds session description: 
The exploration of ocean worlds in the outer Solar System has
significantly expanded our set of targets in the quest to discover
signs of life beyond Earth in the past decade and will continue to be
in the ones to come. We invite contributions that cover a wide range of
topics focusing on confirmed or potential subsurface (including
surficial in the case of Titan's lakes) ocean worlds of our Solar
System. The topics can include studies on the geomorphology and
composition of ocean worlds, geophysics and ocean properties, as well
as laboratory investigations and field work of analogue environments.
Furthermore, studies that examine interactions between planetary
interiors, surfaces, atmospheres, and astrobiology/habitability are
welcomed.

MEPAG VM14 - 2ND INFORMATION CIRCULAR

The next virtual meeting (VM14) of the Mars Exploration Program
Analysis Group (MEPAG) is scheduled for February 2-3, 2022, 1-5 pm ET
(same time block for both days).

Meeting agenda and WebEx connectivity information (including how to
enable closed-captioning support):

https://mepag.jpl.nasa.gov/meetings.cfm

Before VM14 please do this "homework" in preparation for discussions on
MEPAG plans and future program activities. Community activities such as
MASWG, the upcoming Low-Cost Mars Missions Workshop, and the
forthcoming Decadal Survey report will provide guidance for Mars
exploration. It's important that everyone has the opportunity to
provide input during this planning process.

Please come with your ideas that will augment these community efforts:

- Is there something you think is missing from existing
  discussions/reports? 
- What science theme brought forward by the community is most
  important, 
  and what step(s) are necessary to best advance the science? 
- Do you have a different mission "arc" in mind than the examples in
  the MASWG report?  
- Is there a vision of "What is next?" you would like to communicate?

This meeting is open to all members of the Mars science community
including our international colleagues.

DPS 2022 MEETING SELF-NOMINATION FOR SCIENTIFIC ORGANIZING COMMITTEE

The Scientific Organizing Committee (SOC) of the 2022 DPS Meeting in
London, Canada is seeking self-nominations from those interested in
serving on the SOC. These self-nominations are for consideration for
membership. The intent is to build a diverse, equitable and inclusive
committee from these nominations.

Members of the committee are expected to participate in remote telecons
as needed, to review abstracts submitted by the community to the
conference, to help sort those abstracts into sessions (including
plenary sessions) and to help identify and select session chairs. The
bulk of the reviewing and sorting activities typically take place
within a single week.

To self-nominate, please send the following materials to
jmoores@yorku.ca by no later than February 7, 2022:

1) Your name, contact details, and your present affiliation, including
   career stage
2) A list of areas of research in which you feel you could competently
   review abstracts
3) A list of anticipated blackout dates between May 1 and August 31 of 
   2022 which would prevent you from reviewing and sorting abstracts.
