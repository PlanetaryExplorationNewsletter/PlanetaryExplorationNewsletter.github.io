POSTDOCTORAL FELLOWSHIP IN COMPARATIVE PLANETARY EVOLUTION AT CALTECH

The Caltech Center for Comparative Planetary Evolution (3CPE) at the 
California Institute of Technology solicits applications for a 
postdoctoral prize fellowship associated with the center. This 
fellowship will be awarded to an outstanding applicant pursuing 
research in any area related to planetary science, either within the 
Solar System or beyond, using observational, theoretical, or 
computational techniques. The 3CPE provides a collaborative and 
interdisciplinary environment for researchers at Caltech with common 
interests spanning both astronomy and planetary science. Fellows will 
also have full access to Caltech's extensive resources, including the 
Keck and Palomar Observatories and computational facilities.

ASSISTANT PROFESSOR (TENURE-TRACK) FACULTY POSITION IN GEOLOGY AT UCLA

The UCLA Department of Earth, Planetary, and Space Sciences (EPSS) 
invites applications for a tenure-track faculty position at the 
Assistant Professor rank. We encourage applicants from all 
sub-disciplines of geology, geophysics, and planetary sciences to 
apply. Applications from individuals with expertise in 
tectonics/structural geology, rock/ice mechanics and rheology, 
glaciology, early Earth history, or other areas that complement the 
existing strengths at UCLA will be especially welcome. We encourage 
applications from those with experience in field- based 
research/teaching, and community/collegial service that has prepared 
them to contribute to our commitment to excellence and equity, 
diversity, and inclusion.

EPSS faculty conduct research in geology, geobiology, geochemistry, 
planetary science, geophysics, paleobiology, and space physics. The 
ability of applicants to contribute to this multidisciplinary ethos, 
including research primarily focused on Earth, will be a consideration 
in evaluation, in addition to their commitment to enhancing the 
diversity of EPSS faculty and students.

Applications will be accepted via the UC Recruit web site beginning 
September 30, 2022:

[NASA] MUREP DEAP AMENDMENTS WEBINAR - Q&A SESSION

NASA's Minority University Research and Education Project (MUREP) 
recognizes a need to support underrepresented colleges and 
universities to improve their ability to participate in NASA research. 
NASA seeks proposals to create Data Science Equity, Access and 
Priority for Research and Education (DEAP) Institutes through 
consortia of TWO (2) TO THREE (3) institutions that will be partnered 
with NASA mentors/advisors to develop and execute a research project 
over a three-year period.

A MUREP DEAP Amendments Webinar - Q&A Session is Scheduled for 
Wednesday, October 5, 2022 at 4:00 pm - 5:00 pm Eastern Time

Pre-Registration is required:

https://nasaenterprise.webex.com/nasaenterprise/j.php?RGID=rdbc86f85f1d97df2e8fc54f96a31b9db

overview of the opportunity and highlight information contained in the 
EONS 2022 amendments regarding proposal preparation and requirements.

DPS SPLINTER SESSION ON THE URANUS FLAGSHIP MISSION

For those attending DPS either virtually or in person, on Tuesday at 
12:10 pm EDT, in Salon EF, there is a splinter session titled "Uranus 
Flagship: The Importance of Cross-Discipline Science".

This session will consist of a short panel discussion on how the 
pursuit of cross-discipline science connections can maximize the 
science return from a Flagship mission to Uranus, followed by open 
discussion on example investigations or science topics. 
Cross-discipline science (sometimes referred to as System Science) 
activities not only address important science objectives, they also 
serve as triggers for broader cooperative efforts between instrument 
and science teams; breaking the traditional science discipline 
stovepipes is now recognized as a best practice for enabling healthier 
team dynamics and innovating science. Panelists will discuss how ring 
science supports atmospheric and interior studies, how the 
magnetosphere influences the atmosphere and satellite surface 
composition, and how atmospheric studies can inform us about the 
interior and formation of Uranus. This splinter session will be 
followed by a dedicated System Science meeting to be held in 2023.
