[NASA] SMD BRIDGE PROGRAM WORKSHOP ORGANIZING COMMITTEE CALL FOR 
NOMINEES

The SMD Bridge Program is a new initiative to improve diversity, 
equity, inclusion and accessibility within the NASA workforce and 
within the U.S. science and engineering community. It aims to increase 
engagement and partnering between Minority-Serving Institutions (MSIs) 
with other PhD-granting Universities and NASA Centers. SMD will be 
facilitating one or more community planning workshops to 
collaboratively create the Bridge Program with all stakeholders over 
the next several months.

In this letter, SMD is soliciting applications from interested 
individuals in the community for participation as members of the SMD 
Bridge Program Workshop Organizing Committee.

The application material should consist of:
- A two-page cover letter including (1) the reasons for the 
  applicant's interest, and (2) the skills, perspective and 
  experience that the applicant brings to the Committee
- A short statement of commitment
- A one- or two-page resume including relevant experience and/or 
  interest in building long-lasting partnerships between students, 
  mentors, and involvement in programs whose goal is increasing 
  diversity.

Applications are due no later than May 20, 2022, as a single PDF file 
to padi.boyd@nasa.gov.

Questions may be addressed to Dr. Padi Boyd, padi.boyd@nasa.gov.

MEETING ON PLANETARY PROTECTION FOR CREWED MARS MISSIONS

As part of planning for future space exploration, COSPAR (The 
Committee on Space Research) together with participating space 
agencies, is organizing an interdisciplinary meeting to consider next 
steps in addressing knowledge gaps for planetary protection of future 
human missions to Mars. Planetary protection is the discipline of 
preventing harmful contamination of outer space and protecting the 
Earth from potential hazards posed by extra-terrestrial material on a 
spacecraft returning from an interplanetary mission. The next meeting 
in the Planetary Protection Knowledge Gaps for Human Missions to Mars 
series will be held virtually on June 1-2, 2022 from 9:30-3:00 EDT 
each day. The meeting will focus on closure of knowledge gaps in the 
areas of quarantine and sample containment. Reports from earlier 
workshops are posted under Conference Documents at this link:

https://sma.nasa.gov/sma-disciplines/planetary-protection/ 

We hope you will be able to join us at this meeting and contribute to 
the important discussions to ensure integration of planetary 
protection considerations into future mission plans for human missions 
beyond Earth orbit. Please RSVP to valerie.a.chabot@nasa.gov and to 
bette.siegel@nasa.gov by May 2, 2022.

Agenda information will follow shortly.

EPSC 2022 SESSION EXOA6: EXOPLANET OBSERVATIONS, MODELING AND 
EXPERIMENTS - CHARACTERIZATION OF THEIR ATMOSPHERES

EPSC2022 Meeting, Granada, Spain, September 18-23, 2022.

https://meetingorganizer.copernicus.org/EPSC2022/session/44583

Convener: Olivia Venot , Co-conveners: Monika Lendl, Ingo Waldmann, 
Martin Turbet, Giuseppe Morello

The field of extrasolar planets is one of the most rapidly changing 
areas of astrophysics and planetary science. Ground-based surveys and 
dedicated space missions will have soon discovered 5000 planets with 
many more detections expected in the near future. A key challenge is 
now the characterisation of their atmospheres in order to answer to 
the questions: what are the properties of these worlds and what 
processes govern their formation and evolution?

To answer these questions, a broad range of skills and expertise are 
required, stretching from Solar System science to statistical 
astrophysics, from ground-based observations to spacecraft 
measurements, and atmospheric/interior/orbital modeling. The numerous 
studies conducted in the past twenty years have unveiled a large 
diversity of atmospheres, from ultra-hot Jupiters to temperate 
super-Earths.

Current as well as future ground and space-based facilities (e.g. 
ESPRESSO, E-ELT, JWST, ARIEL, ...) will characterise this multifarious 
population in stunning detail and challenge our current understanding. 

Abstract deadline: 18 May 2022, 13:00 CEST.

EPSC 2022 SESSION ODAA2: DIVERSITY AND INCLUSIVENESS IN PLANETARY 
SCIENCES SESSION

The Europlanet Science Congress 2022 will take place at Palacio de 
Congresos de Granada, Spain, 18-23 September 2022.

The deadline for the abstract submission is 18 May 2022, 13:00 CEST.

Conveners: Arianna Piccialli, Victoria K. Pearson, and Andrea Opitz

The benefits of diversity and inclusiveness in the scientific 
community are incontrovertible. Following the success of previous 
years, this session aims to foster debate within the planetary 
sciences community about the reasons behind the under-representation 
of different groups (gender, cultural, ethnic origin, and national) 
and best practices to make the research environment more inclusive 
identifying and addressing barriers to equality.

We invite abstracts focusing on under-representation (gender, 
cultural, ethnic origin, and nationality biases) supported by 
statistics and data; outreach and education activities to reach broad 
and diverse audiences, best practices to support inclusiveness; and 
case studies on mentoring and bias-concerned activities. Data and 
initiatives related to COVID are strongly encouraged.

EPSC 2022 SESSION OPS3: ICY OCEAN WORLDS - PAST AND FUTURE EXPLORATIONS

EPSC abstract deadline is May 18, 13:00 CEST

We would like to draw your attention to our session OPS3 "Icy ocean 
worlds: Past and future explorations"

The exploration of the outer Solar System by Galileo at Jupiter, 
Cassini-Huygens at Saturn, New Horizons at Pluto-Charon and Dawn at 
Ceres, has revealed that several icy worlds harbor subsurface salty 
liquid reservoirs underneath their cold surface. Such discoveries 
provide incentive for future exploration of the icy Galilean 
satellites with Europa Clipper and JUICE, and Titan with Dragonfly, 
and motivate several other mission projects already under 
consideration by space agencies. While we are entering in a new era in 
icy world exploration, understanding these promising worlds and 
preparing for their characterization requires input from a variety of 
scientific disciplines: planetary geology and geophysics (including 
active processes, e.g. plumes), atmospheric physics, life sciences, 
space weathering, as well as laboratory studies, numerical 
simulations, preparatory studies for future missions, and 
instrumentation and engineering technology developments. We welcome 
abstracts that cover all disciplines required for the characterization 
and future exploration of icy world systems.

EPSC SESSION TP4: MARS SURFACE AND INTERIOR

Convener: Ernst Hauber | Co-conveners: Solmaz Adeli, Ana-Catalina 
Plesa, Maurizio Pajola, Rickbir Bahia, Lisanne Braat

This session welcomes all presentations on Mars' interior and surface 
processes. With many active missions, Mars research is as active as 
ever, and new data come in on a daily basis. The aim of this session 
is to bring together disciplines as various as geology, geomorphology, 
geophysics, mineralogy, glaciology, and chemistry. We welcome 
presentations on both past and present processes, either pure Mars 
science or comparative planetology (including fieldwork on terrestrial 
analogues), either observations or modeling or laboratory experiments 
(or any combination of those). New results on Mars science obtained 
from recent in situ and orbital measurements are particularly 
encouraged, as well as studies related to upcoming missions and 
campaigns (ExoMars, Mars Sample Return).

CALL FOR ABSTRACTS TO PRE 9, DUBLIN, 26-28 SEPTEMBER 2022

The 9th International Workshop on Planetary, Solar and Heliospheric 
Radio Emissions (PRE 9) deals with the most recent developments in the 
study of non-thermal radio emissions from the Sun, the radio planets, 
the heliosphere, and from extrasolar sources like exoplanets or brown 
dwarfs. Special emphasis is put on current and future spacecraft 
missions (Juno, Solar Orbiter, JUICE), but also new developments in 
ground-based radio telescopic observations (e.g. with LOFAR) will be 
matters of discussion.

PRE 9 is the continuation of a series of workshops that took place in 
and near Graz/Austria in 1984, 1987, 1991, 1996, 2001, 2005, 2010, and 
2016. However, PRE 9 has now moved to Dublin/Ireland!

For more information please visit our website:

https://pre2022.dias.ie/

The abstract deadline is on 3 June 2022, and the workshop will take 
place 26-28 September in Dublin. It will be primarily an in-person 
meeting with some hybrid options.

The organizing committee looks forward to your abstract submission.
