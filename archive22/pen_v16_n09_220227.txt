POSTDOCTORAL POSITION ON THE EFFECT OF VOLCANISM ON THE MARTIAN 
CLIMATE

Applications are being solicited for a postdoctoral research position 
in atmospheric modeling in the planetary geology group at the Jet 
Propulsion Laboratory. Consideration of applications will begin 
02/21/2022 and continue until the position is filled. Desired start 
date between spring and summer 2022. Dr. Laura Kerber will serve as the 
primary advisor.

Description of the Project: Volcanic eruptions throughout Martian 
history would have produced voluminous quantities of H2S, SO2, and H2O, 
which contributed to transient climate perturbations as well as 
surface reservoirs of ice and sulfate minerals. This goal of this 
project is to create a complete model of the volcanic sulfur on Mars, 
including eruption, residence in the atmosphere, photochemical and 
microphysical evolution, interaction with the water cycle, and 
deposition on the surface. Many parts of the model are already in 
place.

Preferred (but not required) qualifications include:

Prior work with large climate models, experience programming in 
Fortran, understanding of parallel processing/MPI, published research 
involving volcanic emissions, atmospheric physics or chemistry 
(especially microphysics of droplets, cloud physics, sulfur species, 
or photochemistry), or the climate of Mars. Familiarity with French 
is a plus.

[NASA] ROSES-21: OSIRIS-REX SAMPLE ANALYSIS PARTICIPATING SCIENTIST 
PROGRAM STE-1 DUE DATE DELAY AND NEW DOCUMENT POSTED

The objective of ROSES-21 C.30 the OSIRIS-REx Sample Analysis 
Participating Scientist Program (ORSA-PSP) is to enhance the scientific 
return during the sample analysis operational phase of the OSIRIS-REx 
mission by expanding participation in the mission through new 
investigations that broaden and/or complement existing investigations. 
Work solicited by this program element is to enhance, augment, or 
complement planned mission activities during the sample-analysis phase 
of the mission.

Amendment 67 announces three things:

1) A new document, the Higher Resolution of SEIWG flow chart - page 33 
from Sample Analysis Plan (.PDF) has been posted under "Other 
documents" on the NSPIRES page of C.30 ORSA-PSP.

2) Some browser configurations do not prominently display the scroll 
bars that allow visitors to the web page to access all of the PDFs 
posted there.

3) Since some proposers may not have been aware of these documents, 
the ORSA-PSP Step-1 proposal due date has been delayed to March 7, 
2022, to give all potential proposers an opportunity to review all 
of the documents.

ESA ARCHIVAL RESEARCH VISITOR PROGRAMME

To increase the scientific return from its space science missions, the
European Space Agency (ESA) welcomes applications from scientists
interested in pursuing research projects based on data publicly 
available in the ESA Space Science Archives.

The ESA Archival Research Visitor Programme is open to scientists, at 
all career levels, affiliated with institutes in ESA Member States and
Collaborating States. Early-career scientists, including PhD students, 
are particularly encouraged to apply.

During their stay, visiting scientists will have access to archives and
mission specialists for help with the retrieval, calibration, and 
analysis of archival data. In principle, all areas of space research 
covered by ESA science missions can be supported.

Residence lasts typically between one and three months, also 
distributed over multiple visits. Research projects can be carried out 
at ESAC (Madrid, Spain) and at ESTEC (Noordwijk, Netherlands). To offset 
the expenses incurred by visitors, ESA covers travel costs and provides
support for lodging expenses and meals.

Applications received before 1 May 2022 will be considered for visits
in the following autumn and winter (2022/2023).

POSTDOCTORAL POSITION AT JPL

The postdoctoral research associate will work with Dr. Catherine Elder 
and Dr. Tom Nordheim to study the interiors of Europa and the Uranian 
moons. Specifically, the postdoctoral researcher will investigate the 
plausibility of seafloor volcanism on Europa through mantle convection, 
magma generation, migration, and eruption modeling. They will also 
investigate the interior structure and thermal evolution of Miranda and 
Ariel, with the aim of addressing the question: Do these objects have 
current or geologically recent subsurface oceans?

We invite applicants with a recent PhD in planetary science, physics, 
geology, or a related field. We seek someone who has experience in 
numerical modeling and a strong background in physics. Previous 
experience studying icy satellites, mantle convection, or geochemistry

GOLDSCHMIDT SESSION 01A: EXPET IN PLANETARY SCIENCE

Please consider submitting an abstract to our session Experimental 
Petrology in Planetary Science: Insights into the Diversity of Both 
Planets and the Scientists who Study Them (01a), at Goldschmidt 2022 
(hybrid - Honolulu, Hawai'i, July 10-15 2022).

Abstract submission closes March 1, 2022 

https://2022.goldschmidt.info/goldschmidt/2022/cfp.cgi

We encourage submission from experimental petrology-centric research 
as well as inclusion, diversity, equity, and accessibility efforts 
in the field.

Keynote Speaker: Christina Richey, Jet Propulsion Laboratory

Understanding the processes by which rocky planetary bodies 
differentiated into a core, mantle, and crust, and how their 
resulting attributes influenced subsequent geologic events and 
atmospheric compositions is crucial to understanding the evolution 
of solar systems. The aim of this session is to bring together 
diverse perspectives from the various avenues of experimental 
petrology-centric research within the overarching field of 
planetary sciences, in order to spark big picture and 
interdisciplinary discussions. Therefore, we encourage submissions 
from all areas of experimental studies including surface, mantle, 
and core conditions and geochemical studies of achondrites to 
understand the formation and evolution of rocky bodies within or 
outside of our Solar System.
