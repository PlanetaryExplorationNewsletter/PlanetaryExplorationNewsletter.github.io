SMALL BODIES ASSESSMENT GROUP (SBAG) STEERING COMMITTEE POSITIONS OPEN

Three positions are open for the Steering Committee of the Small Bodies 
Assessment Group (SBAG), with three-year terms starting in August 2022.

The Committee organizes SBAG meetings, writes the official SBAG 
findings, and takes a leadership role in other activities where 
community input on topics of interest is needed.

In addition to a member in Planetary Defense who works to understand 
the population of small bodies that may impact our planet, we seek two 
at-large members in any area of small body research at any career 
stage.

The application requires: 1) a two-page CV, including a description of 
participation in SBAG or other small bodies organizations, and 2) a 
short (300 words maximum) statement of interest. Criteria for selection 
are: participation in small bodies community organizations, leadership 
experience, and relevant research or mission experience.

In support of diversity, applicants may specify gender, whether they 
belong to an underrepresented group in STEM, or other additional 
relevant information.

Send applications to Bonnie Buratti (bonnie.buratti@jpl.nasa.gov) by 
May 6, 2022, 8:00 PM EDT. New members will be announced at the 27th 
Meeting of SBAG, June 7-9, 2022.

PHD POSITION IN ATMOSPHERE/EXOSPHERE MODELING AT UNIVERSITY OF BERN, 
SWITZERLAND

The goal of the PhD position is to extend our exosphere model to cover 
the collisional regime in atmospheres below with a Direct Simulation 
Monte Carlo module and coupling to our existing model. This model will 
be used to study atmospheres of planetary objects in our own Solar 
System (mainly the jovian icy moons) as well as exoplanets. The PhD 
position is part of the National Centre of Competence in Research 
Planets at the University of Bern: 

https://nccr-planets.ch/de/ 

The work will be carried out in close collaboration within the NCCR at 
the national level and within the upcoming ESA and NASA Jupiter 
missions at the international level.

The deadline for applications is 29 April 2022, the position is 
available from 1 June 2022. An MSc in physics, astrophysics or similar 
experience is required. Proficient English language skills, both 
written and spoken, are also required; German language skills are a 
plus. Experience in programming is necessary. Applicants should send 
a complete application, including a cover letter describing your 
motivation and qualifications for the position, a CV, as single PDF 
file to:

ROCKY WORLDS II CONFERENCE

July 4-8, 2022 
Oxford, United Kingdom

In-person registration deadline: 15 April, 2022

https://www.rockyworlds.org

The detailed understanding gleaned from the terrestrial planets in the 
Solar System is crucial in the interpretation of extrasolar planets. 
As the characterisation of these new planetary systems proceeds, it 
in turn improves our understanding of the Solar System, and in 
particular of how potentially habitable worlds form, evolve, and are 
distributed throughout the galaxy. 

The Rocky Worlds conference series brings together planetary 
scientists, astronomers, and earth scientists to foster discussion and 
build collaborations that will pave the way for the next decade of 
rocky exoplanet discovery and characterisation.

Invited speakers: 
Nathalie Carrasco, Rebecca Fischer, Sascha Quanz, Elishevah van Kooten, 
Allona Vazan, Masahiro Ikoma

Scientific organisers: 
Tim Lichtenberg, Amy Bonsor, Vivien Parmentier, James Bryson, Oliver 
Shorttle, Colin Wilson, Jayne Birkby, Ray Pierrehumbert

[NASA] REQUEST FOR INFORMATION: INTEREST IN COMPETING FOR OPERATION OF 
THE LUNAR AND PLANETARY INSTTITUTE

This email announces the release of a Request for Information (RFI) via 
NASA Solicitation and Proposal Integrated Review and Evaluation System 
(NSPIRES) that seeks information that may influence the formulation of 
a solicitation(s) to continue activities operated via a Lunar and 
Planetary Institute. Over 50 years ago, the National Academy of 
Sciences recommended the creation of an independent-of-NASA Lunar 
Science Institute that was renamed the Lunar and Planetary Institute 
(LPI) in 1978. LPI is not a NASA facility, and it does not share a 
fiscal identity with NASA nor is it a Federally Funded Research and 
Development Center (FFRDC).

Currently, NASA funds an LPI to be located close to NASA's Johnson 
Space Center (JSC) and to enable the Science Mission Directorate (SMD) 
at NASA Headquarters to further NASA's Planetary Science Goals. The 
purpose of this RFI is to identify entities that have an interest in 
submitting a credible proposal(s) to carry out the 
activities-of-interest-to-NASA that are listed in Section 4 of the RFI 
entitled "Interest in Competing for Operation of the Lunar and 
Planetary Institute" available at short URL:
