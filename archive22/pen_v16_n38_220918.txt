PRONOUNS IN PEN ANNOUNCEMENTS

Language evolves with society and this includes the increased use of
old and new pronouns. We want to be respectful of people's desired
usage of pronouns, including non-binary. We invite everyone to share
their pronouns in announcements if they wish. Because editors and some
of our editing tools do not necessarily recognize the particular usage
or spelling of all pronouns, when submitting an announcement it would
be useful to include a note to the editor about how it is desired for 
pronouns to appear. We have added this to our Submission Guidelines.
The URL for our submission guidelines can always be found at the bottom
of the PEN, and is provided here for convenience:

[NASA] REQUEST FOR INFORMATION: FEDERAL EVIDENCE AGENDA ON LGBTQI+ 
EQUITY

Comments Due: October 3, 2022

https://tinyurl.com/bdesnxy5

White House Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) requests
input from the public to help inform the development of the Federal
Evidence Agenda on LGBTQI+ Equity. Executive Order 14075 on Advancing
Equality for Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Queer, and Intersex
Individuals (June 15, 2022) required the co-chairs of the Interagency
Working Group on Equitable Data to establish a subcommittee on sexual
orientation, gender identity, and variations in sex characteristics
(SOGI) data. That body, now part of the National Science and Technology
Council (NSTC) Subcommittee on Equitable Data, is tasked with the
development and release of a Federal Evidence Agenda on LGBTQI+ Equity,
which will improve the Federal government's ability to make
data-informed policy decisions that advance equity for the LGBTQI+
community.

Questions related to this notice may be directed to Meghan Maury, 
Senior Advisor for Data Policy at (202-456-6121) or by email at
equitabledata@ostp.eop.gov. Individuals who use telecommunication
devices for the deaf and hard of hearing (TDD) may call the Federal
Relay Service (FRS) at 1-800-877-8339, at any day or time, including 
holidays.

OPPORTUNITY MARS EXPLORATION ROVER TARGETS NOW AVAILABLE IN MARS TARGET
ENCYCLOPEDIA

The Mars Target Encyclopedia (MTE) aims to collect in one place
information about observational targets (e.g., rocks, soils) identified
and named during Mars surface exploration. The MTE links targets to
publications that provide information (e.g., composition, provenance,
interpretation) about each target. Version 3 of the MTE was recently
released and includes targets from the Opportunity Mars Exploration
Rover, adding to the MTE's coverage of the Mars Pathfinder, Mars
Phoenix Lander, and Spirit rover missions. Users can search for
targets with particular composition (e.g., "sulfur", "hematite") or
properties such as "layered" or "meteorite". The MTE database is
available at

https://pds-geosciences.wustl.edu/missions/mte/mte.htm

The MTE is funded by a NASA PDART grant and is a collaboration between
the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory and the University of Utah.

BOOK: THE SKY AT NIGHT

Author: Tim Hunter

Ideal for backyard stargazers, The Sky at Night by Tim B. Hunter offers
a unique blend of advice and personal observations to help novices take
up the hobby of watching the night sky with the naked eye. Compiled
from and expanding on the long-running Sky Spy column, this book covers
all the basics - from the Moon, planets, and stars to the history and
origins of constellations and selected famous astronomers and events.
Pictures and illustrations guide readers as Hunter defines and outlines
astronomical terms and shares four decades of personal experiences to
help other would-be astronomers excel in this heavenly hobby. Available
