ROSES-22: DRAFT OF F.10 PAYLOADS AND RESEARCH INVESTIGATIONS ON THE
SURFACE OF THE MOON

https://tinyurl.com/ymnje4jp

F.10 Payloads and Research Investigations on the Surface of the Moon
will solicit development and flight of a science-driven suite of
instruments and supporting technology demonstration payloads expected
to be delivered to the lunar surface on a Commercial Lunar Payload
Services (CLPS) lander in 2027. F.10 PRISM will call for a suite or
suites of instruments that are tailored to complete scientific
investigations prioritized in active decadal surveys at one non-polar
lunar landing destination that is proposed and justified in the
proposal. Technology demonstrations or exploration-centric
investigations are also eligible, as long as proposed instrument suites
are focused primarily on science investigations, and the technology
demonstrations and exploration investigations support those science
investigations. This program element also includes opportunities to
leverage survive-one-lunar-night, mobility, and/or lander-mounted
sample acquisition services provided by the CLPS provider.

Questions and comments regarding this solicitation are due by
September 1, 2022 to Debra Needham at hq-prism@mail.nasa.gov.

LUNAR POLAR VOLATILES 2022 CONFERENCE

We are happy to invite you to the Lunar Polar Volatiles Conference
scheduled for November 2-4. 

The meeting will focus on discussions on the current state of knowledge
of volatiles in the lunar polar regions and outstanding questions to be
addressed by missions anticipated in the next several years. We will
solicit presentations to illuminate the present-day inventory, spatial
distribution of lunar polar volatiles, and processes affecting their
history of accumulation, modification, and erosion inside permanently
shadowed regions. Testable predictions and comparative analyses among
cold-trapped volatiles on the Moon, Ceres, and Mercury are particularly
encouraged. Presentations on upcoming missions or mission concepts
related to polar volatiles are also welcome.

The deadline for abstract submission is August 25, 2022, 5:00 pm CDT.

PROJECT MANAGER AT NASA JSC

NASA and the European Space Agency (ESA) are working together to bring
samples of Martian material to Earth for scientific study. Mars 2020
and its Perseverance rover is the first mission of this international
interplanetary campaign; currently collecting samples to cache on Mars
for future retrieval. Two additional missions are planned for the Mars
Sample Return campaign to follow the Mars 2020 mission to bring samples
to Earth in 2033.

NASA is searching for a hands-on Project Manager responsible for the
overall technical and programmatic direction of the Mars Sample
Receiving Project (SRP). The Project Manager will work with
cross-Agency and international teams of scientists, engineers,
architects, technicians, vendors and international partners to develop
plans, identify risks, and manage performance and schedule within
budget to achieve project goals. They will partner closely with JSC,
JPL, NASA HQ, and ESA leaders to proactively define and manage project
content as well as determine or participate in determining the scope of
each life cycle phase and develop the products for major reviews and
decisions.

The full vacancy announcement is open until August 15, 2022 at:
