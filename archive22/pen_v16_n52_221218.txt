BIENNIAL EUROPEAN ASTROBIOLOGY CONFERENCE (BEACON), MAY 8-12, 2023

The Biennial European Astrobiology Conference (BEACON) will take place
at the La Palma and Teneguia Princess Hotel on La Palma Island
(Canary Islands, Spain) from May 8-12, 2023.

The programme starts on May 8 in the morning and ends on May 12
in the evening. Around 10 invited talks (30 min) by leading scientists
in the field and 30 contributed talks (15 minutes) in addition to a
poster session are planned. The sessions will cover all fields of
astrobiology.

La Palma also offers a multitude of relevant research infrastructures
(telescopes) and locations (active volcanoes, recent lava fields,
Mars-analogue landscapes, etc.). We will visit many of these sites
during our conference excursion. Outreach events for the general
public will also be held.

Bursaries are available for students and early career scientists from
European Astrobiology Institute Participating Entities. Recipients of
the bursaries are selected from the submitters of abstracts by the
Scientific Organisation Committee.

Deadline to submit an abstract: January 31, 2023

Registration deadline: March 1, 2023

AOGS 2023 PS09: GEOLOGY, GEOPHYSICS, AND HABITABILITY IN OUR SOLAR
SYSTEM
 
The surfaces of the terrestrial planets and their satellites have been
largely shaped through geological processes. Extreme conditions on
outer Solar System bodies, such as the Jovian and Saturnian satellites,
as well as the ice giant satellites, result in different types of
exogenic and endogenic features. Fracturing and faulting processes
mainly affect minor bodies such as asteroids and small moons, where
volcanism and tectonism have not played an important role. We invite
contributions that cover a wide range of topics including geomorphology
and composition of volcanic deposits, edifices, and plumes,
volcano-induced deformation and edifice growth and collapse to tectonic
structures, faulting and fracturing processes, crustal stress and strain
analysis, cryovolcanism, fluvial and aeolian features, and any study
related to planetary endogenic and exogenic processes. Studies that
relay interactions between planetary interiors, surfaces, atmospheres,
and astrobiology/habitability are welcomed.

AOGS 2023 will be held in Singapore from July 30 - August 4, 2023.

Abstract deadline: February 14, 2023, 12:00 GMT+8

PLANETARY DATA OFFICER POSITION AT NASA AMES RESEARCH CENTER
 
Ames Research Center seeks a Planetary Data Officer to assist NASA's
Planetary Science Division (PSD) in advancing the Planetary Data
Ecosystem (PDE) and various data initiatives within the Agency and
planetary science community. The PDE is the ad hoc connected framework
of activities and products built upon and supporting data collected by
planetary space missions and research programs, which are primarily
NASA funded. The Planetary Data Officer will play a significant role
in restructuring and improving the PDE.
 
This vacancy opening has been extended for an additional week, now
closing on December 23, 2022.

PHD STUDENT IN EXPERIMENTAL ASTEROID RESEARCH

Lulea University of Technology (LTU) is looking for a highly-motivated
PhD student to join the Asteroid Engineering Laboratory located on the
Space Campus in Kiruna, Sweden.

The successful candidate will carry out laboratory experiments on
asteroid simulants and meteorites with the ultimate goal to understand
the mechanisms that destroy asteroids close to the Sun. The primary
tool for the experimental work is the new Space and High-Irradiation
Near-Sun Simulator (SHINeS), which is used for assessing how
irradiation comparable to that found close to the Sun affects
materials resembling those found on asteroids. The successful
candidate will also contribute to the development of an analytical
and/or numerical model of the destruction process.

The position is fully funded for 4 years.

Application deadline on January 20, 2023.

POSTDOCTORAL POSITION IN COSMIC ICE ASTROCHEMISTRY

Applications are now being accepted for a Postdoctoral Research
Associate to join The Cosmic Ice Laboratory at NASA/GSFC in Greenbelt,
MD. The position consists of a postdoctoral appointment at the
University of Maryland, Baltimore County and funded by NASA through
CRESST II. The successful applicant will join The Cosmic Ice Laboratory
and focus on investigating the radiolytic stability of organic
compounds under conditions relevant to dense clouds or icy Solar
System bodies. The successful candidate will perform radiation
chemistry experiments on ices at low temperatures in vacuum, using a
proton accelerator as the radiation source.

Candidates for the position must have a Ph.D. in chemistry, physics,
or related field by the date of the appointment and should be within
five years of the receipt of their doctoral degree. Ideally,
candidates will have experience with the following: cryo-vacuum
apparatuses, radiation chemistry, and infrared spectroscopy.

Complete applications received by December 31, 2022, will receive
full consideration.

Candidates should send a cover letter, CV (including publication
list), a 3-page statement of research interests, and contact
information for three references via email to Ms. Katherine McKee
(katherine.s.mckee@nasa.gov). The position will remain available until
filled.

POSTDOCTORAL POSITION IN ICY MOON GEOCHEMISTRY, UNIVERSITY OF
WASHINGTON, SEATTLE

Applications are invited for a postdoctoral position in the Department
of Earth and Space Sciences, University of Washington, to work on the
geochemistry of icy moons, primarily Enceladus.

The position will be supervised by Prof. David Catling and
Prof. Baptiste Journaux.

The postdoctoral researcher will contribute to research on the chemical
composition and habitability of the ocean on Enceladus, with relevance
to icy moons in general. The work will include lab experiments and
models of how an ocean at the bottom of an icy fissure turns into a
plume. The purpose is to better understand how plume chemistry relates
to interior ocean composition and potential habitability.

Applicants must hold a PhD in Earth and/or planetary sciences, or a
related field such as physics, or chemistry, and must not have exceeded
5 years previous work at the postdoctoral level. Ideally, candidates
will have experience with cryo-vacuum apparatus and as well as
experience in -or the confidence to learn- numerical modeling of
aqueous geochemistry.

Applications received by January 6, 2023, will receive priority but the
position will remain open until filled.

DART BOARDER PROGRAM FOR FEBRUARY INVESTIGATION TEAM MEETING

The Double Asteroid Redirection Test (DART) Investigation Team is
reopening the "DART Boarders" program, intended to introduce advanced
graduate students and early career scientists (less than 7 years since
a terminal degree) regardless of nationality to the experience of
working on a mission team via an invitation to observe the DART
Investigation Team meeting 6-10 February, 2023.

prior to and week of the team meeting.

Respondents will be selected based upon anticipated impact to their
career path and alignment of research interests with mission
objectives, giving preference to candidates without existing
connections to the team via current advisor-student relationships.

DART recognizes and supports the benefits of having diverse and
inclusive communities and expects such values to be reflected in this
opportunity.
