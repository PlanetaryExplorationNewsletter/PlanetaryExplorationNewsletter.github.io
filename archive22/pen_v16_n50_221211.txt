EGU 2023 SESSION GM10.1/PS1: PLANETARY GEOMORPHOLOGY

Please consider submitting an abstract to the session on Planetary 
Geomorphology (GM10.1/PS1) at the EGU General Assembly 2023. EGU 
(23-28 April 2023) will be a hybrid event facilitating online and 
in-person participation in Vienna.

The Planetary Geomorphology session aims to bring together 
geomorphologists who study the Earth with those who work on other 
bodies such as Mars, Venus, Mercury, the Moon, icy satellites of the 
outer Solar System, comets, and/or asteroids. Studies applicable to 
landscapes on any scale on any solid body are welcome. We particularly 
encourage those who use Earth analogues, laboratory/numerical 
simulation and/or big satellite datasets to submit their work. 
Considered processes could include aeolian, volcanic, tectonic, 
fluvial, glacial, periglacial, or "undetermined" ones. We especially 
welcome contributions from early-career scientists and geomorphologists 
who are new to planetary science.

Session details:

Abstract instructions:

The abstract deadline is 10 January 2023 (13:00 CET).

Best wishes,

Planetary Geomorphology convenors: Lonneke Roelofs, Stephen Brough, 
Frances Butcher, Tjalling de Haas, and Nikolaus J. Kuhn.

EGU 2023 SESSION PS3.1: ADVANCES IN MODELING THE FORMATION AND CHEMICAL 
COMPOSITION OF TERRESTRIAL PLANETS

We cordially invite you to submit abstracts to the EGU session PS3.1, 
Advances in Modeling the Formation and Chemical Composition of 
Terrestrial Planets. The session will be held during the EGU General 
Assembly in April 23-28, 2023 in Vienna, Austria.

The past few years have seen major advances in theories of terrestrial 
planet formation. Pebble accretion has opened new chapters and accurate 
simulations of giant impacts have paved the way for the formation 
models to become quantitative. Also, recent ideas on the early 
instabilities in our Solar System allow for adopting more realistic 
initial conditions. These advances have also paved the way for 
simulating the formation of other planetary systems. The session PS3.1 
focuses on these topics through a combination of invited, contributed, 
and poster presentations. We welcome abstracts for oral and poster 
contributions in all areas related to theoretical, observational and 
experimental studies of terrestrial planet formation in our Solar 
System and extrasolar planets.

For more details and submitting abstracts, please see:

Abstract deadline: January 10, 2023

NASA SEEKS PROPOSALS FOR ARTEMIS III GEOLOGY TEAM

NASA will be seeking proposals through ROSES for the Artemis III 
Geology Team, and have released a draft announcement for public comment
here. Given the importance of this first component of the Moon-to-Mars 
exploration campaign to the Mars community, we wanted to make you aware 
of a Town Hall discussion to be held on December 9, 3pm EST via WebEx 
that will review the draft text of the announcement. Information for 
accessing the Town Hall can be found here:

ACM ASTEROID NAME NOMINATIONS

The Scientific Organizing Committee (SOC) of the Asteroids Comets 
Meteors (ACM) conference recognizes the tradition of announcing new 
asteroid names for (recent, at the time of the meeting) PhD recipients 
in ACM fields. This tradition will continue at the upcoming ACM to be
held in Flagstaff, Arizona June 18-23, 2023. To help make this process 
as complete as possible, supervisors, advisors, and colleagues are 
encouraged to contact any member of the SOC with nominations. 
Nominations should include a citation (<360 characters), full name, and 
birth year for the nominee. Example citations can be viewed here:
