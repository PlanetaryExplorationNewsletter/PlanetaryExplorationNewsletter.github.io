[NASA] REMINDER: (ARTEMIS II) E.11 RESEARCH PATHFINDER FOR BEYOND LOW
EARTH ORBIT SPACE BIOLOGY STEP-1 PROPOSALS ARE DUE SEPTEMBER 1

On August 11, official text and due dates for Artemis II Research
Pathfinder for Beyond Low Earth Orbit Space Biology Investigations were
added to ROSES as program element E.11. This program solicits proposals
for biological research experiments to be flown beyond LEO as internal
payloads on the capsule of the Orion spacecraft during the upcoming
Artemis II mission. To be eligible, proposals to this program element
must utilize and will be limited to only one of the two following model
organisms: Drosophila melanogaster (fruit fly) or Caenorhabditis
elegans (nematode).

Proposals to this program will be submitted by a binding two-step
process in which the Notice of Intent is replaced by a mandatory Step-1
proposal that must be submitted by an organization's Authorized
Organizational Representative. Only proposers who submit a Step-1
proposal are eligible to submit a Step-2 (full) proposal. Step-1 
proposals are due September 1, 2022, and Step-2 proposals are due 
October 13, 2022.

Questions concerning this program element may be directed to Sharmila
Bhattacharya at spacebiology@nasaprs.com.

[NASA] SMD SEEKS VOLUNTEER REVIEWERS FOR RESEARCH PROPOSALS

NASA's Science Mission Directorate is seeking subject matter experts to
serve as external (email) and/or virtual panel reviewers of proposals
to the "ROSES" research solicitation. All of the reviewer volunteer
forms may be accessed on the main landing page at:

https://science.nasa.gov/researchers/volunteer-review-panels

Once on a form, click the boxes to indicate the topics in which you
consider yourself to be a subject matter expert. If your skills match
our needs for that review and there are not too many organizational
conflicts of interest, we will contact you to discuss scheduling.

A wide range of volunteer reviewer web forms have been (re)posted
recently including:

- Heliophysics Technology and Instrument Development for Science
- Heliophysics Early Career Investigator Program
- Weather and Atmospheric Dynamics
- Emerging Worlds
- Solar System Workings
- Planetary Data Archiving and Restoration

MARS 2020/MSR SAMPLE DEPOT SCIENCE COMMUNITY WORKSHOP

September 28 & 30 8am-12pm PDT / 11am-3pm EDT / 5pm-9pm CEST

A depot of samples acquired by the Perseverance Rover in Jezero Crater
needs to be established in the near future for risk management and
other strategic reasons along the Jezero Delta Front. The goal of this
workshop is to inform and solicit input from the science community on
the potential for the samples in this proposed depot to sufficiently
satisfy Mars Sample Return science objectives and thus, constitute a
scientifically return-worthy (SRW) sample set.

The science community is an important stakeholder in the decisions
about the formation of the first depot, and we encourage broad
participation in this discussion. The output from this workshop will be
considered as critical input for the final decision on depot placement.
Logistics

The MSR Campaign Science Group (MCSG) is the primary organizer of this
meeting. This workshop will be held virtually from 8am-12pm PDT on
Wednesday, September 28 and Friday, September 30, with the
intervening Thursday being an "off" day to allow the participants to
consider and develop their thoughts and feedback. Further information

PLANETARY IMPACTS COMMUNITY WIKI PROJECT

https://impacts.wiki

The purpose of this project is to promote collaborations and sharing of
research and educational materials in the topics related to planetary
impact processes. We hope that the connections nurtured through this
project can enable community development and international connections.

The site includes an opt-in Community Directory to help students and
researchers find scientists with specific expertise. You can support
this project by contributing materials, becoming an editor, or
advertising the site. The site will advertise new materials by an
opt-in Newsletter and social media.

We plan to organize community meetings at upcoming conferences to
discuss the needs of the planetary impacts community and potential
community development projects.

CALL FOR PAPERS: THE PLANETARY SCIENCE JOURNAL FOCUS ISSUE ON CENTAURS

The AAS's Planetary Science Journal announces a new focus issue on
Centaurs. Centaurs are icy planetesimals, typically exhibiting
qualities similar to asteroids and comets, which are currently on
unstable orbits in the outer Solar System and in transition between
Trans-Neptunian Objects (TNOs) and Jupiter Family Comets (JFCs).

We invite papers presenting recent results and analysis regarding the
origin, evolution, and composition of Centaurs, as well as discussion
of the scientific importance and relevance of Centaurs as space
exploration targets. Study of individual objects, sub-groups, or the
Centaur population should be a substantial part of the manuscript but
need not be the only topic. 

The Focus Issue is open to submissions immediately and will continue
until December 2023. Accepted manuscripts will be made available in 
the PSJ Focus Issue website as soon as they are published. Checkout 
the first three articles here:

https://iopscience.iop.org/journal/2632-3338/special/2632-3338_Centaurs

Please complete this form telling us about your manuscript:

https://tinyurl.com/nhdctcen

Submitted articles will be evaluated to ensure they are within scope.
Articles in scope will be sent out for review following PSJ policy and 
guidelines.

Email mwomack@ucf.edu for more information.

ESA RESEARCH FELLOWSHIPS IN SPACE SCIENCE

ESA's postdoctoral Research Fellowship programme offers early career
scientists and engineers the possibility to carry out research in a
variety of disciplines related to space science, space applications or
space technology. Research Fellowships in Space Science specifically
offer the opportunity to contribute to ESA's endeavour to explore our
Solar System and the Universe, and cover the fields of heliophysics,
planetary science, astrophysics and fundamental physics. 

The research fellowships offer a unique insight into ESA's environment
and activities while conducting cutting edge research. Mentoring and
training opportunities are available, as are possibilities to engage
with ESA science-related activities (e.g., archive/data science,
operations, calibration, communication, citizen science). 

Duration: Appointments are for a maximum of three years. The initial
project is for two years. An extension for a third year requires a
dedicated proposal and is frequently granted.

Eligibility: Citizens of ESA Member States or of cooperating and
associated countries.
