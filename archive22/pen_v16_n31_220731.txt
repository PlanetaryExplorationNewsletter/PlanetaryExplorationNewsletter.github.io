[NASA] ROSES-22 AMENDMENT 35: C.23 ANALOG ACTIVITIES TO SUPPORT ARTEMIS 
LUNAR OPERATIONS NEW DUE DATE AND MAJOR TEXT REVISION

C.23 supports participation in one or more of NASA's Human 
Exploration-sponsored analog activities. The intent of these analog 
exercises is to provide feedback and inputs to the design of hardware, 
software, and operational procedures being developed for lunar 
exploration with crew that is supported by a science team in Mission 
Control. The focus of this program is on supporting high-fidelity 
science operations and operations constraints through analog mission 
campaigns, including, but not limited to, Joint Extravehicular 
Activity Test Team and Desert Research and Technology Studies. Funding 
provided in this year's program element is intended to enable 
researchers to participate as science team members in the planning, 
execution, and analysis of one or more of these analog mission 
activities. These awards are capped at $30,000 and are for one person, 
for one year in duration. Awards are contingent upon occurrence of 
the analog field campaign activities.

ROSES-2022 Amendment 35 releases a major revision to the text and the 
due date for proposals is now December 6, 2022.

Questions concerning C.23 may be directed to Sarah Noble, 
sarah.k.noble@nasa.gov.

AGU SESSION DI004: EXPLORING PLANETARY INTERIORS: OBSERVATIONS, 
MODELS, AND EXPERIMENTS

Geophysical observations interpreted using quantitative models and 
experiments are the key to advancing our knowledge of the dynamics and 
interior structure of planetary bodies, including variations of 
density, fluid content, and temperature. The intent of the session is 
to promote discussions on the relationship between recent geophysical 
measurements from various planetary missions, new constraints on 
numerical and experimental studies, and the implication for interior 
structures and dynamic processes that involve interactions between 
materials from the crust to largely unexplored core-mantle boundary 
regions in deep planetary interiors. We welcome contributions of 
recent advances in planetary studies that incorporate various mission 
data and constraints, while providing a roadmap for future exploration 
of the Moon, Mars, and other extraterrestrial bodies.

AGU SESSION P008: (EXO)PLANETARY ATMOSPHERES AND EVOLUTION

Understanding the nature and variability of (exo)planetary 
atmospheres, their chemical evolution and the physical mechanisms 
governing atmospheric dynamics are strong driving forces of 
(exo)planetary science and Solar System exploration mission planning. 
We are on the eve of being able to characterize exoplanetary 
atmospheres, thanks to the JWST and its future successors. At the same 
time, better understanding of the Solar System terrestrial planets is 
at hand with incoming missions to Venus. Models of planetary 
atmospheres use these observations to illuminate physical processes 
operating, from the Earth to planets in our Solar System and beyond. 
Processes that govern the interactions of atmospheres with planetary 
surfaces and interiors are an important aspect of planetary evolution, 
for both atmosphere composition and thermal state (including surface 
conditions). The rapidly increasing number of discovered exoplanets 
provides an exciting opportunity for interdisciplinary collaborations, 
between heliophysicists, astrophysicists, planetary and climate 
scientists. This session welcomes observational, theoretical, 
experimental, and field studies relevant to physical and chemical 
evolution of (exo)planetary atmospheres and planetary habitability in 
and outside of our Solar System.

AGU SESSION P018: MERCURY AT THE DAWN OF BEPI-COLOMBO'S ERA - 
INTERDISCIPLINARY EXPLORATION INSIDE AND OUT

NASA's MESSENGER mission revolutionized our understanding of Mercury's 
surface, interior, exosphere, magnetosphere, and heliospheric 
environment. That understanding will soon take a major step forward 
with data from the first flyby of Mercury by the ESA-JAXA BepiColombo 
dual spacecraft mission, subsequent flybys, and eventual orbit. In 
this session, we welcome all contributions on data analysis, 
laboratory measurements, ground-based observations, analog studies and 
theoretical developments that build on the current state of knowledge 
of Mercury, as well as papers that focus on how BepiColombo 
measurements collected during the recent Earth and Venus flybys can be 
used to support investigations at Mercury. The topics of interest for 
this session include Mercury's geology, geochemistry, geophysics, 
plasma dynamics occurring in Mercury's exosphere and 
surface-exosphere-magnetosphere coupling. We also welcome papers 
discussing how outstanding questions about Mercury can be addressed by 
future observations expected from BepiColombo.

AGU SESSION P035: THE NEW MARS UNDERGROUND: NEXUS OF DECADAL PLANETARY 
SCIENCE OBJECTIVES

According to the National Academies, the highest scientific priority 
of NASA's robotic exploration efforts in the coming decade should be 
the completion of Mars Sample Return and subsequently the 
prioritization of the Mars Life Explorer. Intimately tied to these 
decadal objectives is the ongoing characterization of the Martian 
subsurface, particularly regarding 1) the distribution and stability 
of modern liquid water and water ice inventories; 2) the provenance 
and isotopic signatures of organics and trace gases that may serve as 
potential biosignatures; and 3) the identification of habitable 
"refugia environments" which may support extant microbial Martian 
life, should it exist. Our session champions the intrinsic relevance 
the Martian subsurface for the next decade of planetary science. We 
welcome diverse contributions informed by remote observation, 
theoretical modelling, technological development, and laboratory/field 
experimentation of relevant terrestrial analog sites and materials. 

Abstract deadline: August 3rd, 2022

BOOK: PLANETARY EXPLORATION WITH INGENUITY AND DRAGONFLY - ROTARY-WING 
FLIGHT ON MARS AND TITAN

A new book, published by the American Institute of Aeronautics and 
Astronautics, describes the programmatic origins, operating 
environments, and technical design of two very different planetary 
aircraft. "Planetary Exploration with Ingenuity and Dragonfly: 
Rotary-Wing Flight on Mars and Titan" by Ralph Lorenz lays out what 
'space people' need to know about helicopters, and what 'aviation' 
people need to understand about flight through space and operations on 
other planetary bodies. The book reviews Ingenuity's flights on Mars, 
the science and mission design of Dragonfly, and the prospects for 
future planetary aviation.
