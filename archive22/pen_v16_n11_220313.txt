provide researchers with updates on new findings and techniques on
planetary atmospheres from across the world.

March 18 08:00 UTC (= 17:00 JST = 09:00 CET = 04:00 EDT)
Speaker: Takeshi Imamura (University of Tokyo, Japan)
Title: Mesoscale meteorology of Venus revealed by Akatsuki's
observations

We welcome your attendance. Details can be found in the link below:

SCIENCE OBJECTIVES FOR HUMAN EXPLORATION OF MARS WORKSHOP

Denver, CO 
May 4-6, 2022

A human mission to Mars will be a landmark achievement and a golden
opportunity to conduct groundbreaking science on Mars. This workshop
will identify the highest priority science objectives for a human
mission to Mars, identify appropriate mission scenarios that best
enable the science objectives, and define high-level concepts of
operation, including equipment and instrumentation, needed to achieve
the science objectives.

The workshop will immediately follow the May MEPAG meeting in Denver
and is intended to be an in-person working workshop. Attendance and
participation are not contingent on abstract submission, and
registration is free.

LOW-COST SCIENCE MISSION CONCEPTS FOR MARS EXPLORATION - AGENDA &
DEADLINES

With the Low-Cost Science Mission Concepts for Mars Exploration
workshop just three weeks away, we are looking forward to an exciting
event in Pasadena on March 29-31. We are attaching a preview of the
final program, mapped from the original January 11-13 schedule to the
new March dates. We are delighted that 100% of our original oral and
panel presenters, and nearly all of our poster presenters, have
confirmed their plans to participate in the rescheduled workshop. The
final, official version of the program will be posted soon on the
conference website:

https://www.hou.usra.edu/meetings/lowcostmars2022/

We encourage you to visit that site over the coming weeks for any final
announcements or program updates.

SPACE SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING TRAVEL GRANT OPPORTUNITY

The Gerald A. Soffen Memorial Fund is pleased to announce the Spring
2022 Travel Grant application opportunity for undergraduate and
graduate students pursuing studies in fields of space science and
engineering.
 
The Travel Grants enable student recipients to attend professional
conferences to present their research. Recipients may use the Grant for
either virtual or in-person conferences. The Soffen Fund will award up
to $1000 in total, with no individual award greater than $500, to cover
expenses related to presenting research at either a virtual or
in-person conference. The number of awards will depend on applicants'
needs.

The Spring 2022 Travel Grant application deadline is April 15, 2022.
Jerry Soffen, a biologist by training, led a distinguished career in
NASA, including serving as the Project Scientist for Viking and as an
architect for the NASA Astrobiology Institute. The Travel Grant
continues Jerry's dedication to educating and involving future
generations in space science and engineering pursuits. The electronic
application materials and instructions are located on the Soffen Fund
website:

[NASA] PDS: RELEASE OF SECOND ANNUAL NASA PLANETARY DATA SYSTEM 
CUSTOMER SATISFACTION SURVEY

NASA's Science Mission Directorate (SMD) announces the release of the
second annual Planetary Data System (PDS) Customer Satisfaction Survey
(CSS):

https://cfigroupfed.gov1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_9EU3vxgeNksURqS

Please assist NASA in defining the next generation of the PDS by
participating in the 2022 Planetary Data System Customer Satisfaction
Survey. Survey results will be used to identify and prioritize
services, ensuring that the needs of the planetary science community
are met.

The anonymous online survey, developed for NASA by its contractor CFI
Group, takes a few minutes, and optional fields are provided to
register your concerns and comments.  

Please contact the PDS at pds-operator@jpl.nasa.gov with questions on
the survey.

Information on how the PDS is responding to the first 2020 PDS survey
is provided here:
