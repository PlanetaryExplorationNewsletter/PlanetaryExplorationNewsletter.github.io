[NASA] SMD: SPACE BIOSCIENCES TRAINING COURSE CALL FOR APPLICANTS

Solicitation Number: NNH22ZDA009L

Response Due Date: June 1, 2022

NASA invites applications for the Spaceflight Technology, 
Applications, and Research (STAR) training course focused on the 
science and technology behind biological experiments in space. STAR is 
designed to encourage networking and collaborations in spaceflight 
technologies, applications, and research. This course aims to 
facilitate the entry of researchers into space biology and preparation 
for spaceflight experiments using NASA and commercial platforms. The 
STAR course will cover both fundamental and applied aspects of the 
field of space biology, as well as practical aspects of preparing for, 
conducting, and analyzing the results of spaceflight experiments. See 
the web site for more information:

https://science.nasa.gov/biological-physical/programs/star

Submitting a STAR application does not guarantee course availability. 
NASA does not award funding for course participation nor otherwise pay 
for the information solicited. Applicants who are accepted will be 
notified via NSPIRES on or after June 20, 2022. The course will take 
place virtually from September 2022 - February 2023 with sessions held 
bi-monthly for two hours each.

STAR-22 questions will be accepted by email only and must be addressed 
to Egle.Cekanaviciute@nasa.gov using a subject line that states "STAR 
2022 Application".

SCIENCE OBJECTIVES FOR HUMAN EXPLORATION OF MARS WORKSHOP

A human mission to Mars will be a landmark achievement and a golden 
opportunity to conduct groundbreaking science on Mars. This workshop 
will identify the highest priority science objectives for a human 
mission to Mars, identify appropriate mission scenarios that best 
enable the science objectives, and define high-level concepts of 
operation, including equipment and instrumentation, needed to achieve 
the science objectives.

The workshop will immediately follow the May MEPAG meeting in Denver 
and is intended to be primarily an in-person working workshop with a 
live-streamed opening plenary. Attendance and participation are not 
contingent on abstract submission, and registration is free.

For more information, including a draft agenda and registration, 
please visit the workshop website at:

[NASA] SMD: EXOPLANETS RESEARCH PROGRAM CORRECTION AND CLARIFICATION

ROSES F.3 The Exoplanets Research Program (XRP) solicits basic 
research proposals to conduct scientific investigations that 
significantly improve our understanding of exoplanets and exoplanet 
formation.

Two changes were made to XRP:

1. A vestigial reference to "NOI" Section 4 was changed to "Step-1 
proposal"
2. In Sections 3.4 and 3.5 references to "the proposal" have been 
changed to "the Step-2 proposal" to remove any ambiguity.

New text is in bold and deleted text is struck through. The proposal 
due dates are unchanged: Step-1 proposals are due March 31, 2022, and 
Step-2 proposals are due May 26, 2022.

Questions regarding these corrections or ROSES F.3 The Exoplanets 
Research Program (XRP) may be directed to hq-xrp@mail.nasa.gov.

NEOWISE 2022 DATA RELEASE

The Near-Earth Object Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (NEOWISE) 
and IPAC at the California Institute of Technology announce the 
NEOWISE 2022 Data Release.

The 2022 Release includes data acquired during the eighth year of the 
NEOWISE Reactivation mission (Mainzer et al. 2014, ApJ, 792, 30), 13 
December 2020 to 13 December 2021. These data are combined with those 
from Years 1-7 into a single archive that contains ~20.3 million sets 
of 3.4 and 4.6 micron images and a database of ~151 billion source 
detections. 

NEOWISE scanned the sky ~16 times during the first eight years of 
survey operations, with approximately six months between survey 
passes. With twelve or more independent exposures are made on each sky 
position during each epoch, the NEOWISE archive is a time-domain 
resource for extracting multiple, independent thermal flux and position 
measurements of Solar System small bodies and background galactic and 
extragalactic sources.

A guide to the NEOWISE data release, data access instructions, and 
supporting documentation is available at:

https://wise2.ipac.caltech.edu/docs/release/neowise/

NEOWISE is a joint project of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory/California 
Institute of Technology and the University of Arizona, funded by the 
National Aeronautics and Space Administration Planetary Science 
Division.

EARTH AND SPACE EXPLORATION PROGRAM 2022

Earth and Space Exploration Program 2022 is an 8 night - 9 day
expedition for participants where they will explore various sites of
scientific interest and learn from experienced field scientists.

Unlike other academic field trips or tourism packages, ESEP offers a
unique and inclusive package, customized for participants from
different backgrounds and interests. Get out of your comfort zone and
experience Ladakh alongside passionate individuals.

The program will be held from July 2022 - August 2022 and groups of
participants will be allotted based on their interests and 
availability.

The application deadline is May 31, 2022.

There are two different registration categories:

Explorers: A program that is suitable for travelers who want to learn
something new but have no prior experience, or for researchers who
want to collect samples or carry out analogue site studies.

Students: Same experience as above, but with a focus on
academically-oriented learning at an affordable price.
