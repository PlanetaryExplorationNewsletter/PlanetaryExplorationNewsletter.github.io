HAPPY BIRTHDAY PEN!

The first Planetary Exploration Newsletter was sent out on May 24, 
2007 as a service to the community by the Planetary Science Institute.
Since that day, we have published 852 issues covering planetary related
meeting announcements, jobs, proposal solicitations, upcoming events,
government policy announcements, memorials, and commercial 
announcements.

Thanks to our volunteer editors from over the years:

GSA SESSION T99: THE INTERPLAY OF VOLCANISM, TECTONISM, AND IMPACTS 
ACROSS THE SOLAR SYSTEM

Volcanism and tectonism are two of the major processes responsible for 
shaping the surfaces of terrestrial planets, main-belt asteroids, and 
icy satellites alike. In addition to the interaction between these two 
processes, large impacts can have a significant effect on how volcanism 
and tectonism are expressed. We solicit a variety of contributed 
presentations including those focused on observational, laboratory, 
theoretical, or analog research into any aspect of planetary volcanic 
and tectonic activity, including that moderated by the impact process 
or its resultant landforms. 

The deadline for abstract submission is July 19, 2022. The GSA 2022 
hybrid meeting is scheduled for October 9-12 with the in-person 
component hosted in Denver, CO.

Additional information about the GSA Connects Annual Meeting and the 
abstract submission portal can be found at:

Please direct questions to the session conveners: Mallory Kinczyk 
(mallory.kinczyk@jhuapl.edu) or Kelsey Crane

[NASA] ROSES-22 AMENDMENT 18: FINAL TEXT AND DUE DATES FOR 
INTERDISCIPLINARY CONSORTIA FOR ASTROBIOLOGY RESEARCH

A wide array of NASA Science Mission Directorate flight missions 
incorporate astrobiology goals and objectives. For this reason, with 
C.20 Interdisciplinary Consortia for Astrobiology Research (ICAR) 
solicits proposals responding to both the long-term goals and 
objectives identified in the Astrobiology Strategy:

https://tinyurl.com/4smbcses

This is focused on ensuring that the NASA Astrobiology community is 
prepared to respond to the challenge of planning and implementing these 
missions. Accordingly, proposals that place emphasis on research that 
will help prepare for current or future flight programs directed at 
astrobiological targets are encouraged. Proposals must describe an 
interdisciplinary approach to a single compelling question in 
astrobiology, and address at least one aspect of the current Science 
Strategy.

Step-1 proposals are due September 15, 2022, and Step-2 proposals are 
due January 10, 2023. Go to: 

http://solicitation.nasaprs.com/ROSES2022

Questions concerning C.20 ICAR may be directed to Mary Voytek at

[NASA] ROSES-22 AMENDMENT 19: MARTIAN MOONS EXPLORATION MISSION 
PARTICIPATING SCIENTIST PROGRAM FINAL TEXT AND DUE DATES

The Martian Moons eXploration (MMX) mission Participating Scientist 
Program (MMX-PSP) will support scientists at U.S. institutions to 
participate on the MMX mission, which the Japan Aerospace Exploration 
Agency (JAXA) is developing for launch in 2024. ROSES-2022 program 
element C.24 MMX-PSP solicits proposals for science investigations to 
be carried out during the primary flight and post-flight phases that 
significantly enhance the overall knowledge obtained from the MMX 
mission and that address outstanding questions directly related to 
mission objectives. Two categories of investigations are solicited in 
this call: Instrument Science and Sample Science.

This amendment releases final text and due dates for MMX-PSP, which was 
previously listed as TBD. Mandatory NOIs are due June 16, 2022, and 
proposals are due August 16, 2022. Go to:

http://solicitation.nasaprs.com/ROSES2022

Questions concerning MMX-PSP may be directed to Thomas S. Statler at

[NASA] ROSES-22 AMENDMENT 20: SPACE WEATHER CENTERS OF EXCELLENCE FINAL 
TEXT AND DUE DATES

This amendment releases final text and announces due dates for Space 
Weather Centers of Excellence (SWxC), program element B.22 of ROSES-22, 
which had been previously released as draft for community comment. The 
changes between draft and final will be summarized in a FAQ downloadable 
under "Other documents" on the NSPIRES page for this program element.

B.22 Space Weather Centers of Excellence (SWxC) solicits proposals for 
multi-institution, multi-/inter-/trans- disciplinary collaborations 
(Centers) that address grand challenge goals of space weather that are 
ambitious in scope and transformative in nature as part of an integrated 
multi-agency initiative to advance the science and technology of space 
weather. This program is intended to support research that cannot be 
effectively done by individual investigators or small teams, instead 
requiring the synergistic, coordinated efforts of a research center.

Step-1 proposals are due June 21, 2022, and 25-page Step-2 proposals 
are due August 25, 2022. Comments and questions concerning B.22 SWxC 
may be to Jesse Woodroffe at jesse.r.woodroffe@nasa.gov. Go to:

construct new models for planetary atmosphere evolution and modify and 
run existing models of planetary climate.

Candidates should have experience working with models including 
radiative transfer and/or planetary climate. An early start date is 
preferred, however this is negotiable with the successful candidate.

UChicago hosts a vibrant planets and exoplanets research program, with 
particular emphasis on terrestrial and sub-Neptune exoplanets:

https://tinyurl.com/4yfjfccy

Application materials should be received by July 4 for full
consideration. Applicants should send a CV, a brief description of
research interests and experience, and a list of publications as a
single PDF file to kite@uchicago.edu. Applicants should also arrange
to have two letters of reference sent to this email address. Please
