CENTAURS: A PROPOSED NEW AAS-IOP EBOOK

Open Call For Expressions Of Interest

This will be the first comprehensive research reference covering the 
Centaurs as a population of objects critical to our understanding of 
the formation and evolution of icy small bodies in the Solar System. 
Topics to be reviewed in CENTAURS include:

- Current states of Centaur observations and laboratory experiments
- Connections to the Trans-Neptunian objects (TNOs), Jupiter family 
  comets (JFCs), and other icy body populations
- Current theories on Centaur formation
- constraints on Centaurs' physical properties (shapes, composition, 
  surface properties, etc)
- Our current best understanding of volatile outgassing, outbursting, 
  surface evolution, ring formation, and other processes that affect 
  Centaurs
- Proposed in situ exploration
- New tools, such as the Vera Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of 
  Space and Time (LSST) and JWST, which could transform our 
  understanding of the Centaurs

We are looking for a wide range of interested contributors. If you 
study Centaurs in any way and might be interested in contributing to a 
review chapter, please provide your contact information here:

PLANETARY GEOLOGY TENURE TRACK POSITION AT AUBURN UNIVERSITY

The Department of Geosciences at Auburn University invites 
applications for a Planetary Geosciences faculty position at the rank 
of tenure-track Assistant Professor or Associate Professor. The 
appointment would begin August 2023. Specialties may include, but are 
not limited to, terrestrial analogue studies of planetary surface 
processes (e.g., impact cratering and volcanic processes), orbital 
and/or surface robotic mission-related geosciences (e.g., missions to 
the Moon and Mars), planetary mineralogy and petrology (including 
geochronology, e.g., study of meteorites and/or future returned 
samples), instrument science for planetary missions, planetary 
geophysics and climate dynamics, and related disciplines such as 
astrobiology. We seek a dynamic individual with strong research 
potential who can obtain external funding and can link their research 
program to existing department strengths in geochemistry, 
geochronology, geomorphology, tectonics, climate science, 
remote-sensing and GIS, and sedimentary geology.

[NASA] ROSES INCLUSION PLAN BEST PRACTICES WORKSHOP NOVEMBER 1-2

NASA's Science Mission Directorate (SMD) is happy to announce the 
first virtual Inclusion Plan Best Practices Workshop, scheduled for 
November 1-2, 2022, 1:00-3:00 pm Eastern Time each day.

Many programs within NASA's Research Opportunities in Space and Earth 
Sciences (ROSES) are now requiring that proposals contain an inclusion 
plan that outlines how the team will work against barriers to 
create and sustain inclusive work environments. SMD is hosting an 
Inclusion Plan Best Practices Workshop to provide proposers with some 
background and tools needed to be active participants in creating and 
maintaining inclusive work environments.

This workshop is open to any member of the science community and may 
be of particular interest to those writing ROSES or mission proposals 
requiring inclusion plans. 

More information about the workshop, including an agenda, speaker 
bios, accessibility information, and details on how to register, can 
be found at:

https://www.hou.usra.edu/meetings/inclusionplan2022/

Questions about the workshop can be directed to Ryan Watkins at

ISSUES OF POWER AND ITS INFLUENCE ON NAMING CONVENTIONS FOR PLANETARY 
FEATURES

Open University PhD student Annie Lennox has released an open letter 
addressed to the international astronomical union (IAU) demonstrating 
the underrepresentation of women in space science nomenclature. Annie 
found that only 12% of craters on Mercury are named after women, and 
for craters named after people on Mars and the Moon only 2% 
commemorate a woman. The IAU-imposed conventions, which require an 
individual to have achieved demonstrable fame before being adopted, 
contribute to a lack of diversity across the Solar System as 
historical injustices have denied women and marginalised groups the 
level of fame or recognition achievable by men. The current 
conventions go with the grain of these historical injustices, rather 
than try to repair them.

additionally gathering statistics on racial, ethnic, cultural 
diversity and will make these publicly available.
