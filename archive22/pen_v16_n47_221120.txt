PS5, co-organized by CR7

Convener: Marc S. Boxberg | Co-conveners: Hans Huybrighs,
Ana-Catalina Plesa, Stephanie Cazaux, Simon C. Stahler

The goal of this multidisciplinary session is to bring together
scientists from different fields, including planetary sciences and the
cryosphere community, to discuss the current status and next steps in
the in-situ exploration of the icy moons of our Solar System. We
welcome contributions from analogue studies, on the results of current
and past missions, planned missions, mission concepts, lessons learned
from other missions, and more. Contributions bridging the
cryosphere-icy moons communities are of particular interest to this
session.

EGU23 SESSION PS4.4/PS4: SCIENTIFIC RESULTS FROM THE EMIRATES MARS 
MISSION PRIMARY MISSION

Please consider submitting an abstract to the session on Scientific
results from the Emirates Mars Mission primary mission (PS4.4/PS4) at
the EGU General Assembly 2023. EGU23 will be facilitating online and 
in-person participation in Vienna, Austria, 23-28 April 2023.

The abstract deadline is 10 January 2023 (13:00 CET), and the deadline
for support applications is 1 December 2022 (13:00 CET).

The Emirates Mars Mission spacecraft orbiting Mars will complete its
primary science mission (one Mars year) in early 2023. Scientific
observations emphasize measurements of the behavior of the atmosphere,
including the lower atmosphere down to the surface (and including
interactions with the surface), the upper atmosphere and ionosphere,
and the magnetosphere and interactions with the solar wind. The focus
is on understanding diurnal, geographical (latitude/longitude/local
solar time), and temporal variations, and the physical and dynamical
coupling between the different components of the atmosphere and upper
atmosphere, throughout a Mars year. This session will focus on the
major scientific results from the mission and plans for the extended
mission.

EGU23 SESSION PS6.1: ICE GIANT SYSTEM SCIENCE AND EXPLORATION

We are pleased to announce that the abstract submission is open for EGU
2023, held in Vienna on 23-28 April 2023 and online.

The abstract deadline is 10 January 2023 (13:00 CET), but those seeking
travel support should submit their abstract by 1 December 2022 (13:00
CET).

The Ice Giant System Science Exploration session welcomes papers
addressing ice giant system science, including the composition,
dynamics, and processes shaping ice giant atmospheres, interiors,
magnetospheres, satellites, and rings. The session particularly
encourages papers addressing the results from the anticipated James
Webb Space Telescope (JWST) observations of the Uranus and Neptune
systems, along with new insights from ground-based observations.
Additionally, due to the prioritization of a Uranus Flagship mission in
the recent NASA Planetary Science Decadal Survey, papers related to
future ice giant system exploration, instrumentation, mission concepts,
technology developments, and international cooperation are of
significant interest.

THERMAL MODELING FOR PLANETARY SCIENCE WORKSHOP: 18-20 APRIL 2023

We are pleased to announce the 4th Workshop on Thermal Models for
Planetary Science will take place 18-20 April 2023. TherMoPS IV will
be held at the European Space Technology Centre (ESTEC) in Noordwijk,
The Netherlands.

https://www.cosmos.esa.int/web/thermops4/

Thermal modelling in planetary sciences has experienced an
extraordinary growth in recent years in response to a profusion of new
data. In addition to orbital and ground-based observations of planets
and moons, new thermal infrared data has become available for hundreds
of thousands of asteroids, comets, transneptunian objects as well as
dust in our Solar System. Furthermore, infrared radiation is also
commonly used to study exoplanets and protoplanetary discs around other
stars. New observations of temperature-driven phenomena on diverse
Solar System bodies motivates the development of more sophisticated
thermal models. 

This meeting, the fourth in the Thermal Models for
Planetary Science workshops follows and builds on the first three

SAVE THE DATE: OXYGEN IN PLANETARY BIOSPHERES

Green Bank Observatory May 5-7, 2023 

We are pleased to announce the Second Barry Blumberg Memorial Workshop
in Astrobiology.
 
This 3-day workshop at the Green Bank Observatory will focus on topics
related to the role of oxygen in the universe, planets and life, and
how the rise of oxygen on Earth may (or may not) likely have analogs on
other planets. 

Attendance is limited to 50 participants, by application only, and all
registration and travel expenses will be covered. The conference scope
should be construed broadly; researchers working on any related
problems are strongly encouraged to apply.
 
Recognizing the challenges the pandemic has presented for networking
over the past several years, this workshop will have a strong focus on
early career researchers, and will have broad international
participation. Presenters are encouraged to gear their talks to an
interdisciplinary audience, eschewing the trees of internecine
disciplinary debates for the forest of broader understanding.

PHD POSITION IN HAZE & CLOUD INTERACTION AT UNIVERSITE DE REIMS
CHAMPAGNE ARDENNE, FRANCE

Dr. Panayotis Lavvas is seeking for a highly motivated Ph.D. student to
study the interplay between haze and clouds in Titan's atmosphere. 

Hazes formed in Titan's upper atmosphere partake in the formation of
clouds in the lower stratosphere due to the condensation of multiple
photochemical products. Cassini observations reveal that the cloud
composition can vary drastically depending on latitude and season, due
to local changes in temperature and condensates. However, heterogeneous
processes on the surface of hazes and clouds are poorly understood,
while the role of cosmic rays in cloud formation requires further
attention. 

The goal of this thesis is to improve our understanding of haze and
cloud coupling at different regions of Titan's atmosphere, by combining
detailed models of photochemistry/microphysics with input from
dedicated laboratory experiments and constraints from Cassini
observations.

Candidates should have programming experience, while relative
background in astronomy/planetary science is welcomed. The position
opens in early 2023.
