ANNY-CHANTAL LEVASSEUR-REGOURD (1945-2022)

With great sadness we are informing the planetary community that 
Anny-Chantal Levasseur-Regourd passed away on August 1, 2022.

A memoriam has been prepared by her colleagues Edith Hadamcik, Jeremie 
Lasue and Jean-Baptiste Renard. It is posted at:

[NASA] ROSES-22 AMENDMENT 40: B.17 ECLIPSE FINAL TEXT AND DUE DATES
 
On April 8, 2024, a total solar eclipse will be visible over Mexico, 
the USA and Canada. It is estimated that a large fraction of the 
population in North America will witness this natural event: 

https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/eclipses/future-eclipses/eclipse-2024

B.17 Interdisciplinary Science for Eclipse (ISE) solicits development 
of new research and/or enhancement of existing research, applied to the 
2024 total solar eclipse. This total solar eclipse will be visible 
from a large swath of land mass covering Mexico, the USA and Canada and 
the Pacific and Atlantic oceans. All proposals must demonstrate links 
to the 2024 solar eclipse. This program element supports scientific 
research and development and deployment of existing and/or new 
technology. Go to:

https://solicitation.nasaprs.com/ROSES2022 

Questions concerning B.17 ISE may be directed to Madhulika ("Lika") 
Guhathakurta at madhulika.guhathakurta@nasa.gov.

[NASA] ROSES-22 AMENDMENT 41: F.7 SUPPORT FOR OPEN-SOURCE TOOLS,
FRAMEWORKS, AND LIBRARIES DEFERRED TO ROSES-2023

When it is solicited, F.7 Support for Open Source Tools, Frameworks, 
and Libraries (OSTFL) seeks proposals for the improvement and 
sustainment of high-value, open-source tools, frameworks, and libraries 
that have made significant impacts to the SMD science community.

ROSES-2022 Amendment 41 announces that F.7 OSTFL, which had been listed 
as "TBD" will not be solicited in ROSES-2022. Instead, it will be 
solicited in ROSES-2023, to be released February 14, 2023. Go to:

https://solicitation.nasaprs.com/ROSES2022

Questions concerning F.7 OSTFL may be directed to Steven Crawford at 
steven.m.crawford@nasa.gov.

The International Commission on Planetary Atmospheres and Evolution 
(ICPAE), which is one of the commissions of the International 
Association of Meteorology and Atmospheric Sciences (IAMAS), organizes 
a monthly webinar. The primary objective of our webinar series is to 
provide researchers with updates on new findings and techniques on 
planetary atmospheres from across the world.

INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON AEOLIAN RESEARCH (ICAR)

The International Conference on Aeolian Research (ICAR XI) will be held 
July 10-14, 2023 at the Las Cruces Convention Center in Las Cruces, 
New Mexico and includes a field trip to White Sands National Park and 
the Jornada Experimental Range. Registration begins October 1, 2022 
and abstract submission begins January 1, 2023. Please see this link 
for more information:

CALL FOR MISSION CONCEPT AND TECHNOLOGY NEEDS ABSTRACTS FOR NASA SMD'S 
TECHNOLOGY SHOWCASE

NASA's Science Mission Directorate is planning a Technology Showcase in 
January 2023 to raise the awareness of innovative system or instrument 
technologies that may be able to increase the science return from 
future missions. Technologies funded by both NASA and the larger 
technology community will be showcased to scientists and mission 
managers, like you, with the power to influence upcoming mission 
proposals.

For this, NASA is requesting brief abstracts (up to 2 pages), from 
scientists and concept teams intending to propose planetary missions 
under upcoming Announcement of Opportunities or to outline directed 
Flagship concepts, identified in the recent Planetary Science Decadal 
Survey (2023-2032). These abstracts will be posted on a NASA-managed 
public website, informing Showcase attendees.

The abstracts should discuss information beneficial to providers 
bringing their technologies to the Showcase, including: Science goals 
and objectives; Target destination (including unique features, e.g., 
extreme temperatures, atmosphere, high radiation); Mission 
architecture; Platform (e.g., lander, orbiter); Expected measurements; 
Target solicitation (e.g., New Frontiers, Discovery, SIMPLEx) or a 
Flagship opportunity; and Any technology challenges or opportunities 
(if known).

Abstracts or related questions should be submitted by October 14 to 
tibor.balint@jpl.nasa.gov.

SEEKING CO-CHAIRS FOR CROSS-AG INCLUSION, DIVERSITY, EQUITY, AND 
ACCESSIBILITY WORKING GROUP

The Cross-AG Inclusion, Diversity, Equity, and Accessibility Working 
Group (IDEA WG) is looking for a new Co-Chair! The IDEA WG aims to 
support NASA and the Planetary Science Assessment/Analysis Groups (AGs) 
in building a more inclusive planetary science community, by developing 
and disseminating relevant resources, findings, and recommendations. 
The WG periodically reports to the Planetary Science Advisory Committee
(PAC), which is tasked with advising NASA's Planetary Science Division.

The two WG Co-Chairs are responsible for organizing WG meetings, 
co-creating strategies for advancing IDEA in planetary science, and 
advocating for the group's consensus recommendations. Membership is 
open to all, but you do not need to be a current member of the WG in 
order to apply for the Co-Chair position. Applications for the open 
Co-Chair position are due by Wednesday, August 31, 2022 and may be 
submitted in written, video, audio, or other form to 
xagidea@gmail.com.

More about the Working Group, and application guidelines at: 

https://www.lpi.usra.edu/idea/working-group 

Please feel free to email xagidea@gmail.com with any questions about 
the group, co-chair responsibilities, or the selection process.
