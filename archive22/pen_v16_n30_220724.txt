AGU SESSION EP009: DECIPHERING THE STRATIGRAPHIC RECORD OF SURFACE 
PROCESSES

Surface process systems include rivers, alluvial fans, dune fields,
etc. These systems are sensitive to external forcing, such as tectonic
and climatic conditions, and internal forcing, such as avulsion and
migration. In principle, stratigraphy provides a record of past surface
processes, and deciphering this is crucial to: (1) characterize the
dynamics and environments of ancient landscapes; (2) understand the
movement of water and sediment across planetary surfaces; and (3) 
quantify the response of ancient landscapes to tectonic and climatic
change. However, interpreting this record can be challenging (e.g.,
outcrop/data/timescale limitations). This session welcomes
contributions that focus on deciphering, or advancing our ability to
decipher, surface processes from the stratigraphic record, and which
span surface process systems on Earth and other planetary bodies. We
particularly encourage contributions that tackle this challenge using
multi-disciplinary approaches, including fieldwork, satellite
observations, experimental work, and numerical models. 

Please submit your abstracts to this session using the AGU portal by
August 3. We welcome submissions from early career scientists and new
members of the discipline.

AGU SESSION P005: CARBON ACROSS THE SOLAR SYSTEM

Please consider contributing an abstract!

Studies of the existence and state of carbonaceous material on Solar
System bodies is at the forefront of planetary research. Results from
studies of samples of low-albedo asteroid 162173 Ryugu from the
Hayabusa2 probe are being shared and discussed. The OSIRIS-REx space
probe has retrieved samples from low-albedo asteroid 101955 Bennu. As a
framework for these studies, telescopic, laboratory and theoretical
studies of carbon in all its forms have recently snowballed. The 2018
SSERVI Carbon in the Solar System workshop launched a series of
presentations and discussions at various venues, enabling an
information exchange around the weathering of carbonaceous compounds in
response to thermal processes and irradiation, and what implications
these compositions have for understanding material processing in the
Solar System. We will generate and share ideas to support research of
the new samples, along with studies of carbon, in various forms, at
other locations across the Solar System.

AGU SESSION P013: GIANT PLANET INTERIORS

New constraints to the present-day interior structure and dynamics of
giant planets are critical to advance our understanding of the
formation and evolution of planets in the Solar System and beyond. The
Juno and Cassini missions have recently revealed key aspects of the
interiors of Jupiter and Saturn from a wealth of new measurements.
Further, new studies of Uranus and Neptune continue to highlight the
relevance of ice giants in understanding the exoplanet population. This
session will bring together theory and observations capable of
advancing our understanding of giant planet interiors. We welcome
submissions within a broad range of topics, including: ring and Doppler
seismology, gravity fields, normal mode oscillations, zonal flows and
differential rotation, dynamo magnetic fields, core detection and
characterization, consequences of stable stratification, helium and
heavy element bulk composition, formation scenarios, and evolutionary
pathways.

We highly encourage submissions from early career scientists. 

Please submit your abstract before August 3.

AGU SESSION P017: MACHINE LEARNING AND DATA SCIENCE IN PLANETARY
SCIENCE

Many facets of research in planetary science rely on analyzing large
volumes of in-situ and spacecraft data. Traditionally, these data were
collected and analyzed manually. In recent decades, developments in the
field of machine learning (ML) have begun to gradually augment
traditional techniques, answering the need for automatic methods that
can rapidly and intelligently extract information from large datasets
in a useful manner.

This session will be dedicated to data driven research that leverages
ML and data science to enhance our scientific understanding and return
from planetary data and missions. Topics may encompass data analysis on
the ground or onboard spacecraft for existing and future missions and
instruments. Submissions are welcome for applications across science
and engineering, including but not limited to: spacecraft operations
and mission planning; surface, atmosphere, and space environment
characterization; object detection and classification; change and
novelty detection; interpretable methods; and other studies that apply
ML and data science methods to planetary science.

AGU SESSION: P023 PLANETARY ATMOSPHERES, SPACE WEATHER, AND MAGNETIC
FIELDS

Atmospheric retention, and how it is influenced by stellar activity
(i.e., space weather) and a planet's magnetic field, is a topic of
interest for Solar System and extrasolar planets.

Measurements of atmospheric escape rates and processes from Solar
System planets exist, with the MAVEN mission having provided detailed
measurements of the erosion of Mars' atmosphere. Comparison of escape
rates from Venus, Earth, and Mars has sparked debate about whether
planetary magnetic fields shield atmospheres or accelerate erosion. The
Kepler "radius gap" between extrasolar sub-Neptunes and super-Earths
suggests that atmospheric escape can be driven by the interaction
between a planet's atmosphere and its host star's space weather.

We encourage submissions on all aspects of magnetic fields of Solar
System planets, their interactions with the solar wind, and extensions
to extrasolar planets.

Please submit abstracts by August 3.

https://agu.confex.com/agu/fm22/prelim.cgi/Home/0 

The intent is to have a session at the American Astronomical Society 
241 Meeting to focus on results from extrasolar planets.

AGU SESSION P036: ULTRAVIOLET OBSERVING OF SOLAR SYSTEM TARGETS

Please consider contributing an abstract!

Ultraviolet spectroscopy and imaging have a decades-long history as
valuable techniques for studying atmospheres, aurorae, plumes and
surface composition and volatiles on asteroids, comet nuclei and moons.
While there continue to be opportunities for UV remote sensing from
Earth orbit and in future robotic missions, the infrastructure for UV
instrumentation is at a crossroads. Existing orbital facilities are
nearing the end of their useful lives and there continue to be many
phenomena that cannot be effectively studied with existing,
high-heritage instrument designs. Exciting advances in UV-optimized
technologies promise new capabilities that can be incorporated into the
next generation of robotic probes, flexible SmallSat missions, and
large aperture space-based observatories. This session welcomes
abstracts covering UV science results, as well as reports on progress
toward developing new technologies such as UV detectors, high
performance coatings and novel sensor designs.
