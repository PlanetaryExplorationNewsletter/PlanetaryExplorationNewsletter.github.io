[NASA] SOLICITATION FOR MEMBERSHIP ON THE MARS SAMPLE RETURN CAMPAIGN 
SCIENCE GROUP - PHASE 1

The Mars Sample Return Campaign is a strategic set of proposed
missions/projects to be implemented by a partnership between ESA and
NASA that would transport sealed samples, collected by NASA's Mars 2020
rover, to the Earth for scientific investigation, the first samples
ever to be returned from another planet. The challenge will be keeping
the samples pristine, contained and isolated from the Earth's
environment, while conducting sample science as an international
endeavor.

SCIENCE OBJECTIVES FOR HUMAN EXPLORATION OF MARS WORKSHOP

Denver, CO
May 4-6, 2022

A human mission to Mars will be a landmark achievement and a golden
opportunity to conduct groundbreaking science on Mars. This workshop
will identify the highest priority science objectives for a human
mission to Mars, identify appropriate mission scenarios that best
enable the science objectives, and define high-level concepts of
operation, including equipment and instrumentation, needed to achieve
the science objectives.

The workshop will immediately follow the May MEPAG meeting in Denver
and is intended to be primarily an in-person working workshop with a
live-streamed opening plenary. Attendance and participation are not
contingent on abstract submission, and registration is free.

ANNUAL MEETING OF PLANETARY GEOLOGIC MAPPERS: SAVE THE DATE

The Annual Meeting of the Planetary Geologic Mappers is scheduled to be
held on June 22-23, 2022, at the Northern Arizona University in
Flagstaff, Arizona, with virtual participation available.

The annual meeting will bring together community members to report
progress on geologic mapping projects, discuss a wide range of mapping
strategies, and coordinate map-based scientific investigations of
planetary surfaces at multiple scales. Specific attention will be
focused on how geology-based site characterization can support human
exploration. Abstracts are solicited for topics, including progress
reports on active mapping investigations, mapping strategies, mission
support, community resources, and education. Group discussions will
address map data standardization and dissemination, map-based
investigations of geologic processes, ways to modernize and improve
geologic maps for human and robotic exploration, and the use of
geologic maps to support exploration.

EXOPLANETS IN OUR BACKYARD 2: SAVE THE DATE
 
The Exoplanets in Our Backyard 2 workshop is scheduled for November
2-4, 2022, in Pasadena, California, with virtual participation
available. The Venus Exploration Analysis Group (VEXAG) meeting is
scheduled two days after the Exoplanets workshop. As it becomes
available, more information regarding the VEXAG meeting will be posted
on the VEXAG website.

Exoplanets in Our Backyard 2 is a workshop hosted by the VEXAG, OPAG,
ExoPAG, MEPAG, and MExAG. The goal of the workshop is to examine and
discuss exoplanet-solar system synergies on planetary properties,
formation, evolution, and habitability. Topics include comparative
planetology on worlds near and far; Solar System studies as a baseline
for studies of extrasolar planetary properties and evolution; and
lessons learned on planetary statistics, demographics, and system
architectures from extrasolar planetary systems. This workshop aims to
foster and build new collaborations among scientists in the solar
system and exoplanet communities and to help guide the direction of
future exploration and observations of worlds in the Solar System and
beyond.

EPSC SESSION TP1: MERCURY SCIENCE AND EXPLORATION

Granada, Spain, September 18-23, 2022

Understanding the formation, evolution, composition, interior
structure, and environment of Mercury is of primary interest to better
understand Mercury and the role this terrestrial planet plays in the
evolution of our Solar System.

NASA's MESSENGER spacecraft provided many insights and surprising
results regarding these goals. MESSENGER data are still under analysis
and will continue to provide many important contributions to Mercury
science.

However, MESSENGER also raised many questions that are still open and
will be addressed by the new joint ESA/JAXA mission to Mercury,
BepiColombo, which was successfully launched in October 2018. In
October 2021, the first of six flybys of Mercury took place.

This session welcomes contributions addressing the planet's geology,
surface composition, geodesy, interior structure, exosphere,
magnetosphere, gravity, and magnetic fields, based on modeling,
laboratory experiments, and observations (ground-based, remote-sensing
and in situ). The first analyses of BepiColombo's flyby data from
Mercury are welcome. Finally, contributions of concepts of future
missions to Mercury are encouraged.
