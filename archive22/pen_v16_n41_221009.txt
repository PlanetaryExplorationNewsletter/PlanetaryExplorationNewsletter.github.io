[NASA] ROSES-22: C.22 CONCEPTS FOR OCEAN WORLDS LIFE DETECTION 
TECHNOLOGY NOT SOLICITED THIS YEAR

The goal of Concepts for Ocean Worlds Life Detection Technology 
(COLDTech) is to support the development of spacecraft-based technology 
for surface and subsurface exploration of ocean worlds such as Europa 
and Enceladus to develop and reduce the technical risk of technology so 
that they may eventually be incorporated into future flight missions 
and/or proposed in response to future Announcements of Opportunity for 
these missions.

This program will be solicited no earlier than ROSES-2024.

Questions concerning C.22 COLDTech may be directed to Ryan Stephan, 
ryan.a.stephan@nasa.gov.

[NASA] SCIENCE CAREER PATH TOOL TOWN HALL MEETING 

NASA's Science Mission Directorate will hold a community town hall on 
the NASA Science Career Path Tool at 1:00 p.m. Eastern Thursday, 
October 20. This town hall will be focused on the Science Career Path 
Tool, an interactive online tool that features five distinct science 
career tracks and summarizes the common roles across the NASA science 
workforce. The tool can assist scientists, managers, students, and 
prospective employees to NASA in their awareness of career 
opportunities, help plan and navigate careers, and determine training 
and development needs to better prepare them for different roles. See:

https://sciencecareers.apps.nasa.gov/#/

TWO TENURE-TRACK ASSISTANT PROFESSOR FACULTY POSITIONS IN EARTH AND 
PLANETARY SYSTEMS SCIENCE, UTSA

The Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences in the College of 
Sciences at the University of Texas at San Antonio (UTSA) invites 
applications for TWO tenure-track positions at the Assistant Professor 
rank starting in Fall 2023, in the broadly defined area of Earth and 
Planetary System Science.  

Assistant Professor - Planetary Systems Modeling. We seek candidates 
who apply geospatial data (in situ, remote sensing, experimental, 
numerical simulations) and system modeling approaches to answer 
fundamental scientific questions related to the evolution and coupling 
of lithosphere, hydrosphere, cryosphere, biosphere and atmosphere, in 
the Earth and Planetary systems.  

Assistant Professor - Planetary Science. Research areas of interest 
include, but are not limited to, astrobiology (e.g., extremophile 
behavior, origin and evolution of life on Earth, and the search for 
life in the Universe), astromineralogy (e.g., evolution of minerals, 
mineralogy of meteorites and other astromaterials), planetary surface 
processes (e.g., aeolian transport, impact cratering, space 
weathering, and volcanism), and planetary interiors (e.g. geophysical 
and geochemical modeling). Planetary analog site investigations, using 
field, experimental, and/or modeling approaches, are encouraged.  

Application instructions are available at:

GSA PENROSE CONFERENCE - THE ROLE OF OUTBURST FLOODS IN EARTH AND 
PLANETARY EVOLUTION

We are pleased to announce a GSA Penrose Conference, "The Role of 
Outburst Floods in Earth and Planetary Evolution," which will take 
place from June 5-9, 2023, at Camp Delany, Coulee City, Washington, 
situated at the foot of the spectacular flood-carved Dry Falls in 
Grand Coulee.

This conference will encompass the range of outburst flood science, 
focused on four key themes: (1) Channeled Scabland and the Missoula 
Floods; (2) the universal occurrence of outburst floods on Earth and 
other planets; (3) the mechanics of outburst flood processes; and (4) 
broader Earth system and societal implications of outburst floods. The 
conference will review past work, address the current state of 
research, and help chart the future of outburst flood science through 
presentations, discussions, and multiple field trips.

Registration is limited to 75 participants, and applications open on 
October 17, 2022, and are due on January 27, 2023. All pertinent 
information can be found here:
