ON GEOMORPHOLOGY

Dear Colleagues,

This is a reminder that the abstract deadline is approaching for the 
International Conference on Geomorphology:

https://www.icg2022.eu/home.html

The meeting will be held in Coimbra, Portugal, 12-16 September 
2022. The abstract submission deadline is 14 March 2022, 13:00 CET.

Please consider submitting an abstract to the Planetary Geomorphology 
session, which showcases landscapes and surface processes on solid 
bodies across the Solar System, including on planets, dwarf planets, 
moons, comets, and asteroids. The session aims to highlight the 
diversity of geomorphic processes that have operated on different 
Solar System bodies through time. This includes fluvial, glacial, 
periglacial, volcanic, tectonic, aeolian, and impact processes, and 
their interactions. We encourage submissions on studies that use Earth 
analogues, laboratory experiments, numerical simulations, remote 
sensing and/or new techniques to investigate planetary surfaces. We 
welcome submissions from early career scientists and those who are 
new to the discipline.

The conference programme includes several field excursion options, and 
thematic sessions on a wide range of geomorphological topics of 
interest to planetary geomorphologists.
