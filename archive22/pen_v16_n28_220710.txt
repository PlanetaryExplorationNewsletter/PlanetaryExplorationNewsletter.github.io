CALTECH/JPL POSTDOC IN STABLE ISOTOPE GEOCHEMISTRY

Applications are invited for a postdoctoral position in clumped 
isotope geochemistry within Caltech's Division of Geological & 
Planetary Sciences. The successful applicant will work with Professor 
John Eiler and Dr. Amy Hofmann (JPL) on the collection and 
interpretation of clumped isotope signatures in polycyclic aromatic 
hydrocarbons (PAHs) from different classes of carbonaceous meteorites.

Applicants for this position must have a PhD in geochemistry, organic 
geochemistry, isotope geochemistry, organic chemistry, or equivalent 
by the time of the appointment. Additional required qualifications 
include significant organic chemistry 'wet lab' experience and a 
working knowledge of the principles of stable isotope geochemistry. 

The selected candidate is expected to begin as soon as possible. The 
initial duration of the position is one year.

POSTDOCTORAL RESEARCHER AT CU BOULDER/LASP

The Exploration of Planetary Ices and Climates (EPIC) group at the 
University of Colorado's Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics 
(LASP) seeks a postdoctoral researcher (RS-I, i.e., within ~3 years of 
Ph.D.) in planetary science. Research in the EPIC group encompasses 
theoretical and observational studies of the surfaces and atmospheres 
of planets, natural satellites, and small bodies. The successful 
candidate will collaborate with EPIC group members on currently funded 
projects and seek to develop an independent research program. A focus 
of this position will include investigations using data from NASA's 
Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter and the Dawn at Ceres mission to address 
fundamental questions about ice on airless bodies.

THE ROAD TO MISSION SCIENCE: SEMINARS FOR STUDENTS AND EARLY CAREER 
RESEARCHERS

The Lunar and Planetary Institute is hosting webinars for those who 
have an interest in becoming involved in current or future planetary 
science missions. Undergraduate and graduate students, postdocs, and 
early career scientists are invited to join us for a discussion of how 
to prepare for a career in mission science.
 
The virtual event will feature a panel of mentors and mission 
scientists representing active and upcoming planetary missions, 
including Curiosity and Perseverance, Dragonfly, and DART. Panelists 
will share their backgrounds, experiences, and recommendations. 
Participants will be encouraged to ask questions and make connections 
with mission scientists. We will describe planetary missions, discuss 
mission science careers, and highlight relevant opportunities for 
students and early career scientists.
 
The next event will be a 90-minute virtual seminar on Tuesday, July 
19, at 3 p.m. EDT / 2 p.m. CDT / 1 p.m. MDT / 12 p.m. PDT.

This year's annual Geological Society of America meeting features 
numerous sessions devoted to planetary sciences. We would like to 
highlight the session titled "Friends of Hoth, Episode VI: Return of 
the Small, Icy, and Ocean Worlds (T93)."

We seek abstracts relating to surface, structural, and tectonic 
processes; interior and thermal evolution; and planetary analogs as 
they pertain to solid bodies in the outer Solar System. This includes 
experimental, observational, and theoretical approaches.

The deadline for abstract submission is July 19th. GSA is scheduled 
for October 9-12, 2022 in Denver, CO. 

Additional information about the GSA meeting and to submit and
