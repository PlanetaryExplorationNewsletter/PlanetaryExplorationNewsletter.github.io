2023 NEXT-GENERATION SUBORBITAL RESEARCHERS CONFERENCE OPENS 
REGISTRATION

Registration is now open for the 2023 Next-generation Suborbital 
Researchers Conference (NSRC-2023), happening February 27 to March 1 
in Broomfield, Colorado.

NSRC is the premier conference for researchers and educators interested 
in commercial suborbital reusable vehicles. It provides in-depth NASA, 
FAA, flight provider and spaceport briefings, as well as extensive 
presentation and networking opportunities for researchers and 
educators, as well as companies involved with next-generation 
suborbital platforms, both robotic and those with human crews.

Organized by Southwest Research Institute (SwRI) and the Commercial 
Spaceflight Federation (CSF), NSRC-2023 will feature presentations, 
panel discussions, workshops, local aerospace company tours, poster 
presentations and extensive networking opportunities.

The conference has over two dozen industry, academic, and agency 
sponsors. Sponsorship opportunities for the 2023 conference are still 
available. Please visit: 

https://nsrc.boulder.swri.edu/sponsorship-opportunities

The three-day NSRC-2023 conference will include keynote and invited 
talks, individual flight provider workshops, and contributed talks by 
researchers and educators. It will also feature a reception for 
sponsors and VIPs.

NSRC-2023 is soliciting abstracts through January 15, 2023. To submit 
an abstract for a contributed talk or poster, or to request exhibit 
space, visit the NSRC 2023 website at:

EXMAG CALL FOR APPLICATIONS FOR 2023 MEMBERSHIP

The Extraterrestrial Materials Analysis Group (ExMAG) is a 
community-based, interdisciplinary group providing a forum for 
discussion and analysis of matters concerning the collection, curation, 
and analysis of extraterrestrial samples. ExMAG is seeking applications 
for Secretary, Meeting Chair, Mars Subcommittee Chair, and 
Microparticle Subcommittee Chair. We also seek members for the 
Microparticle and Meteorite subcommittees and a social media 
coordinator. Applications are due December 16 for three-year 
appointments starting in January 2023. All applications will be 
normalized to career stage and ExMAG strives to include many voices. 
The full call, including position descriptions and application 
instructions, may be found at:

TENURE-TRACK FACULTY POSITION IN PLANETARY SCIENCE AT UNIVERSITY OF 
COLORADO BOULDER

The Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics at the University of 
Colorado invites applications for a tenure-track faculty position to 
start in August 2023 in the general field of planetary science. The 
opening is targeted at the level of Assistant Professor, but 
experienced candidates with appropriate credentials will be considered 
for an Associate Professor appointment. Depending on the background and 
teaching interest, the successful candidate would also be affiliated 
with the appropriate academic department at CU.

Areas of interest include: Research approaches from remote sensing, to 
instrument development, to space missions, to laboratory studies and to 
theory, addressing research targets both within our Solar System and 
exoplanets, and applying fields such as atmospheric science, planetary 
geology, astrobiology, geophysics, space environments, dynamics, etc.

The University of Colorado Boulder is committed to building a 
culturally diverse community of faculty, staff, and students dedicated 
to contributing to an inclusive campus environment. We are an Equal 
Opportunity employer, including veterans and individuals with 
disabilities.

Evaluation of applications starts November 28, 2022. Position will 
remain open until filled.

EGU23 SESSION PS4.5: PLANETARY SEISMOLOGY

Please consider submitting an abstract to the session on Planetary
Seismology (PS4.5/GM3/SM5) at the EGU General Assembly 2023. EGU23 will
be facilitating online and in-person participation in Vienna, Austria, 
23-28 April 2023.

The abstract deadline is 10 January 2023 (13:00 CET), and the deadline
for support applications is 1 December 2022 (13:00 CET).

Seismology is one of the most powerful tools to study the interior of
planetary bodies and their tectonic regime. However, studying the
seismicity of solid bodies other than Earth is technically challenging
and the seismic data we currently have is sparse. In addition to
mission-driven insights, modelling presents an increasingly powerful
tool that can help to estimate the expected seismicity of different
planetary bodies. This session aims to bring together planetary
seismology studies on a range of planetary bodies to showcase the
impressive successes that have been booked so far and to learn from 
each other for the future. We welcome contributions on the (anticipated)
observations from space missions, such as InSight and Dragonfly, as 
well as theoretical estimates and modelling efforts on the seismicity 
of planetary bodies. We also encourage technical contributions on 
methods to detect seismicity on planetary bodies.

POST-DOCTORAL FELLOWSHIP IN COMPUTATIONAL/THEORETICAL PLANET MODELING,
CENTER FOR MATTER AT ATOMIC PRESSURES (CMAP)

The Center for Matter at Atomic Pressures (CMAP), an NSF Physics 
Frontiers Center, invites applications for a Post-Doctoral Fellowship 
in Computational/Theoretical Planetary Modeling. We are particularly 
interested in candidates focused on the formation, structure, interior 
and atmosphere evolution of terrestrial-type planets, both within the 
Solar System and exoplanets. We envision the candidate to become an 
emerging expert in the next generation of global planet evolution 
models, and one who can facilitate incorporation of the most relevant 
improved microphysics and microphysical data into computational 
planetary modeling tools for practical use by the broader planetary 
astrophysics community.

CMAP is a collaboration between U. Rochester, Princeton, UC Davis, 
MIT, U. Buffalo, and UC Berkeley; team members communicate weekly. 
For this position, the institution at which the candidate takes 
primary residence is negotiable. We expect the candidate to interact 
broadly with the CMAP team. Some travel among the partner universities 
required.

Candidates should have a Ph.D. by the start date (September 2023, 
negotiable) in planetary physics, astrophysics, or related 
disciplines. Send application package: CV, a statement of research 
interests, and 3 letters of recommendation to 
natalie.antal@rochester.edu.
