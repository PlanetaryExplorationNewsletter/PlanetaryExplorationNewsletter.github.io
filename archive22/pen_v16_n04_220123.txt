ABSCICON 2022 SESSION: FROM PREBIOTIC CHEMISTRY TO ASTROBIOLOGY - THE 
RISE OF LIFE ON AND BEYOND EARTH

Abstract Submission Deadline: Wednesday, January 19, 2022

https://agu.confex.com/agu/abscicon21/prelim.cgi/Session/112092

A comprehensive chemical perspective into the study of biosignatures 
requires investigation of a wide variety of chemical reactions and 
processes. Lab experiments along with complementary high-fidelity 
computer simulations are essential in defining biosignatures and for 
origins of life research. With the increasing power of supercomputers 
and with advanced chemical theories, computer simulations provide 
detailed mechanistic explanations of observations, and also predict 
phenomena that are often difficult to observe in the lab. This session 
seeks papers that offer existing/novel theoretical models and 
experimental works that address the chemical and environmental 
conditions relevant to astrobiology on terrestrial planets/moons or 
ocean worlds. This includes computational and experimental works 
related to prebiotic chemistry, chemistry of early life, 
biogeochemistry of life's interaction with its environment, chemistry 
associated with novel and/or agnostic biosignatures, and chemistry 
pertinent to conditions that could possibly harbor life (e.g., Titan, 
Enceladus, Europa, TRAPPIST-1, habitable exoplanets, etc.).

INSIGHTSEERS PROGRAM APPLICATION OPEN

The InSight team is recruiting a fourth round of "InSightSeers". This 
is a program intended to expose early career scientists to the 
experience of working on an interplanetary mission team. They will be 
paired with a mentor from the science team and allowed to observe the 
virtual science team meeting in its entirety from March 2-4, 2022. We 
hope that this will provide valuable insight (ha) into the work and 
team dynamics that take place on missions and help early career 
scientists make informed decisions about their career paths.

This opportunity is open to graduate students in or beyond their third 
year of postgraduate studies (Ph.D. or Master's) and early career 
scientists within seven years of receiving their post-graduate degree. 
Respondents will be selected based upon the anticipated impact to 
their career path and the alignment of their research interests with 
the scientific objectives of the mission. InSight recognizes and 
supports the benefits of having diverse and inclusive communities and 
expects that such values will be reflected in this opportunity. 
Questions can be sent to Mariah Baker (mmbaker40@gmail.com) with the 
subject line "InSightSeers". For more details and to apply, fill out 
this form by Friday, February 4, 2022:

VENUS AT COSPAR 2022

The 43rd COSPAR Scientific Assembly will take place in Athens, Greece, 
from July 16-24, 2022. The conference is planned to be in-person, with 
possibility to participate virtually.

You are invited to submit abstracts to the session B4.1: Venus Science 
and Exploration. The session description can be found at:

That page will be updated with details of solicited presentation once 
these are confirmed.

In addition to the presentations and discussion in the B4.1 Venus 
session, COSPAR anticipate that there will be an interagency panel 
discussion on international collaboration; further details will be 
announced soon.

Other Venus-related COSPAR sessions include, among others:

- C3.1: Planetary Atmospheres
- C3.2: Planetary Upper Atmospheres, Ionospheres and Magnetospheres
- PSB.1: Scientific Ballooning: Recent Developments in Technology and 
  Instrumentation

ICG2022: PLANETARY GEOMORPHOLOGY SESSION

Abstracts are currently being accepted for the Planetary Geomorphology
Session at the 10th International Conference on Geomorphology
(September 12-16, 2022, Coimbra, Portugal).

Abstract Submission deadline March 14, 2022, 13:00 CET:

https://meetingorganizer.copernicus.org/ICG2022/session/44363

Abstract instructions:

The Planetary Geomorphology session showcases landscapes and surface 
processes on solid bodies across the Solar System, including on 
planets, dwarf planets, moons, comets, and asteroids. The session aims 
to highlight the diversity of geomorphic processes that have operated 
on different Solar System bodies through time. This includes fluvial, 
glacial, periglacial, volcanic, tectonic, aeolian, and impact 
processes, and their interactions. We encourage submissions on studies 
that use Earth analogues, laboratory experiments, numerical 
simulations, remote sensing and/or new techniques to investigate 
planetary surfaces. We welcome submissions from early career 
scientists and those who are new to the discipline.

"PLANETARY SCIENCE: THE YOUNG SOLAR SYSTEM" CONFERENCE ANNOUNCEMENT

After several delays due to the COVID-19 pandemic we are happy to 
finally announce the Rencontres du Vietnam: Planetary Science meeting
for 5-11 June 2022 entitled "The Young Solar System".

For decades scientific researchers wondered how the Solar System 
formed and evolved. This field of research is populated with
cosmochemists, planetary scientists, geologists, geophysicists and 
astronomers who all try to unravel what happened over 4.5 billion
years ago. Yet despite much effort many issues remain obscure. Our 
goal is to host an interdisciplinary mid-sized meeting of broad
scope with highly-acclaimed key speakers of international standing. 
We aim to unite ourselves to discuss barriers to progress, propose
solutions and identify and foster future collaboration that will 
advance our understanding of the young Solar System. The meeting will
last five days and will be a mixture of presentations and active 
discussions with one afternoon for leisurely activities. Abstract and
registration deadline are 1st April 2022. Our apologies for the short 
notice but there have been many issues to sort out due to the current 
Omicron and Delta COVID waves.

We hope to see you all there!

NEPTUNE/TRITON SYSTEM SEMINAR SERIES

This seminar series showcases recent developments in scientific topics 
covering all aspects of the Neptune/Triton system: the magnetosphere, 
satellites, rings, atmosphere, ionosphere, interior structure, and 
magnetic field as well as their formation, thermal evolution, 
variation, and science related to analog objects such as Uranus. 
Please join us on the second Tuesday of each month at 11:00 AM ET for 
a Neptune/Triton-relevant presentation from a guest speaker, followed 
by a lively discussion and community updates/news. View the seminar 
schedule, register for seminars, and sign up for the listserv to

[NASA] DRAFT TEXT FOR PREPARATORY SCIENCE INVESTIGATIONS FOR EUROPA 
RELEASED FOR COMMENT
 
NASA recently released the draft version of a new R&A program called 
Preparatory Science Investigations for Europa (PSIE). When it is 
solicited, the goal of PSIE will be to further our understanding of 
critical topics in Europa exploration in advance of the Europa Clipper 
mission. This preparatory work will provide critical context to enable 
more efficient analysis of Clipper data by the science community and 
will help generate discoveries and new questions that will feed into 
mission planning for the latter half of the prime mission and for any 
potential extended mission. This will maximize the science return from 
the radiation-limited lifetime of the Europa Clipper. The text is 
available on the NSPIRES website.
 
The Planetary Science Division is seeking comments on this draft text 
from the community, especially for the five "Critical Questions". 
Please send responses to this draft text to Curt Niebur at 
curt.niebur@nasa.gov by March 18, 2022.

FIRST ANNOUNCEMENT: IAU FOCUS MEETING 8: "PLANETARY ASTRONOMY VIA 
TELESCOPIC AND MICROSCOPIC APPROACHES"

Fifty years have passed since Apollo 11, the first successful manned 
mission to land on the Moon. Since then, the planetary science 
community has grown tremendously, surveying small Solar System bodies 
by telescope, sending spacecraft to all major planets, and sending 
spacecraft to some of the smaller Solar System bodies. We are making 
progress and growing sophisticated in Solar System research with 
telescopes and microscopes, and we are about to establish a new 
frontier in research linking the Solar System, exoplanets, planet-
forming regions, and astrobiology.

In this context, we organize this Focus Meeting (FM8), to take place 
August 2-3, 2022 during the IAUGA2022 in Busan, the Republic of Korea. 
We expect that planetary astronomers who study their targets with a 
wide range of size scales using various techniques gather together to 
exchange their ideas and recent findings, and provide an opportunity 
to set future science goals to be achieved in the coming decades.

Registration takes place through the IAUGA website:
