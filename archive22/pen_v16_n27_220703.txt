GSA SHORT COURSE 525: INTRODUCTION TO PLANETARY IMAGE ANALYSIS WITH 
ARCGIS

Saturday, October 8, 2022, 8am-5pm, Cost: $40

Registration link: 

https://community.geosociety.org/gsa2022/program/short  

Choose Course #525. NOTE: You must register to attend the GSA Annual 
Meeting in Denver to attend the Short Course!

This workshop introduces participants to image analysis, including 
interpretation and feature mapping, using ArcGIS Pro software, 
focusing on tasks and features most used in planetary science and 
geology in general. It is accessible to participants with no prior 
experience in GIS but includes optional advanced activities relevant 
to experienced users. Most of the workshop consists of hands-on 
exercises, with some demonstrations. The purpose of the workshop is 
to expose participants to the basic tools that are available in 
ArcGIS Pro for geological research. This will be taught through the 
process of selecting a hypothetical landing site for a Mars rover 
using image data from the Mars Odyssey and Mars Global Surveyor. 

Scholarships are available to two students from underrepresented 
communities to cover the costs of participating, including travel 
and registration. Please contact us at spif@astro.cornell.edu for 
scholarship application instructions.

JPL POSTDOC OPPORTUNITY IN MARS MINERALOGY

Dr. Katie Stack Morgan, Research Scientist in Planetary Geology, 
invites applications for a postdoctoral researcher to work on Mars 
remote sensing mineralogy research at the NASA Jet Propulsion 
Laboratory in Pasadena, CA. This post-doc will advance our 
understanding of the global distribution and origin of the mineral 
serpentine on Mars using CRISM data and cutting-edge processing 
techniques.

The post-doc, in collaboration with the PI, will:

- Use dynamic aperture factor analysis/target transformation (DAFA/TT) 
and radiance ratio analysis to localize and validate serpentine 
spectra in CRISM images

- Produce a validated and complete global map of Mg-rich serpentine on 
Mars

- Analyze the geologic context, terrain age, and stratigraphic context 
of serpentine detections using CRISM, HiRISE, and CTX data to 
constrain the mechanisms that controlled serpentinization on Mars.

Required qualifications:

Candidates should have a recent Ph.D. in Planetary Science, Earth 
Science, Geology or Geosciences, Remote Sensing, or related field. The 
ideal candidate will have experience analyzing remote sensing data 
from Mars or Earth including: spectroscopic data, orbiter images, and 
digital elevation models. Desired qualifications: Experience coding in 
Matlab and Python, familiarity with ENVI, and experience with CRISM, 
CTX, and HiRISE data. Go to:

REQUEST FOR SURVEY PARTICIPANTS

My name is Alyvia Fondren, and I am an undergraduate student at Albion 
College in Michigan. I am working with Dr. Andrea Francis in the 
Psychology Department and Dr. Nicolle Zellner in the Physics Department 
in hopes of understanding more about women's experiences with STEM 
mentors during their undergraduate experience. I am also interested in 
knowing whether there is a difference between women's experiences with 
their mentors at liberal arts colleges compared to large universities. 
Determining whether there is a difference in experiences at one type of 
institution over another may help guide the creation of mentorship 
programs for women in STEM.

You will be asked to complete a questionnaire that asks you to complete 
questions about possible mentorship experiences and the type of 
undergraduate program that you attended. Your participation is entirely 
voluntary and will take no more than 15 minutes.

https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/YXQRVDC

For any additional information desired, please contact Dr. Andrea 
Francis at afrancis@albion.edu or Dr. Nicolle Zellner at 
nzellner@albion.edu. A request for more information does not 
obligate you to participate in this study.

Thank you so much for your time.

PHD POSITION: LABORATORY STUDIES FOR THE ICY SURFACES OF PLANETARY
BODIES

The Space Science and Planetology division, University of Bern, 
Switzerland, is looking for an experimentalist to duplicate processes 
resulting in particle release from icy surfaces of satellites: ice 
irradiation with ions, electrons, and UV photons, to provide the 
release efficiency and the chemical composition of ejecta for the case 
of ions, UV photons, and electrons impacting an ice surface. We are 
looking for a talented and motivated person who enjoys experimental 
physics. Experience with electronics, vacuum instrumentation, ice 
samples, and mass spectrometry would be of advantage.

The position is available from 1 October 2022, and is funded for 4 
years. Candidates with demonstrated experience in experimental work 
will be favoured. The salary is in accordance with the personnel 
regulations of the Canton of Bern. Please submit your application by 
14 August 2022 as a single PDF file consisting of a cover letter in 
which you describe your motivation and qualifications for the position, 
a CV, list of your publications, and a list with names of three 
references.

[NASA] ROSES-22: C.26 APOLLO NEXT GENERATION SAMPLE ANALYSIS FOR
COMMUNITY COMMENT

The goal of the 2022 Apollo Next Generation Sample Analysis (ANGSA) 
Program will be to maximize the science derived from samples returned 
by the Apollo Program in preparation for future lunar missions 
anticipated in the 2020s and beyond. To achieve this, the 2nd ANGSA 
call will focus on small, high-value samples that are nearing their 
pristinity limit.

The draft text for this program element has been released. At this 
time, we are requesting community feedback regarding the list of 
pre-selected samples in Section 1.1. The goal is to include samples 
that are nearing their pristinity limit and would be of high scientific 
potential for a consortia study. Comments on the samples listed in this 
draft, including requests for potential additional samples, must be 
submitted by July 29, 2022, to HQ-ANGSA@mail.nasa.gov. Those who 
submit comments may not receive individual responses. However, on 
release of the final text, NASA will enumerate significant changes made 
to the sample list between the draft and final solicitation, either 
through a FAQ or changes document. Go to: 

http://solicitation.nasaprs.com/ROSES2022

Questions and comments concerning the draft of C.26 ANGSA may be 
directed to HQ-ANGSA@mail.nasa.gov.
