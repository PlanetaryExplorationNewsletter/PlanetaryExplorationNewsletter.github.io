[NASA] SPACE TECHNOLOGY RESEARCH INSTITUTES (STRI22) RELEASED

The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Headquarters
has released a solicitation, titled Space Technology Research
Institutes (STRI), as an appendix to the Space Technology Mission
Directorate (STMD) umbrella NASA Research Announcement (NRA) titled
Space Technology Research, Development, Demonstration, and Infusion
2022 (SpaceTech-REDDI-2022). Complete details can be found at:

https://nspires.nasaprs.com

STMD is seeking to invest, via research institutes, in university-led,
sustained, multidisciplinary space technology research focused in
strategic areas for transformative impact to future NASA exploration
and science. The research institutes construct enables coordination of
experts from a wide range of fields and organizations in a single
distributed research structure.

NASA plans to make up to 2 awards, which are expected to be in place
summer 2023. Proposals are being solicited via a two-step process where
preliminary proposals are mandatory and only those invited may submit a
full proposal. Preliminary proposals are due August 3, 2022, 5 pm
Eastern, and the target deadline for invited full proposals is November
3, 2022, 5 pm Eastern.

Comments and questions may be addressed by email to the Space
Technology Research Grants Program at hq-STMD-STRI@mail.nasa.gov.

none of which were regularly released with an ongoing mission:

- 2022.05.27 MGS TES Atmospheric Recalibration
- 2022.05.12 Mars Express HRSC radiometrically calibrated data V4
- 2022.05.05 LRO Diviner Regional Cumulative Products
- 2022.05.04 Mars Express HRSC radiometrically calibrated data V4

[NASA] PDS: MARS RECONNAISSANCE ORBITER DATA RELEASE 61

The NASA Planetary Data System announces Release 61 of data from MRO.
This release contains raw, calibrated, and derived data products
nominally covering the time period August 9 through November 8, 2021.
Some instruments have more recent data.  The data are archived at
various PDS nodes.

- CRISM, SHARAD, Radio Science: Geosciences
- HiRISE, CTX, MARCI: Cartography and Imaging Sciences
- MCS: Atmospheres
- SPICE: NAIF

This release includes the first delivery of CRISM MSV TRDRs, with data
coverage from 2012-2020. The MSVs were not originally included in the
archive because there was a flaw in the EDR construction that
compromised the ability to calibrate the data. The EDRs have now been
rebuilt and the data properly calibrated. The CDR supporting data for
the MSV TRDRs have been added to the EDR/CDR volumes. MSV TRDRs for
2021 and onward will be added in future releases.

The data may be accessed at:

https://pds-geosciences.wustl.edu/missions/mro/

For a view centered on this release

https://pds.nasa.gov/datasearch/subscription-service/SS-20220601.shtml

All available PDS data may be found at:

The next release is scheduled for September 1, 2022.

EARLY CAREER MEXAG STEERING COMMITTEE POSITION OPENING

The Mercury Exploration Assessment Group (MExAG) is seeking
applications for an Early Career member of the Steering Committee, with
a nominal term of three years. MExAG is a community-based,
interdisciplinary body that was established by NASA to provide science
input and analysis needed to plan and prioritize Mercury research and
exploration activities. The Steering Committee serves the MExAG
community through the organization of community meetings, documents
outlining scientific and exploration goals of the community, and
community findings to be presented to NASA.

https://www.lpi.usra.edu/mexag/

Steering Committee membership is a volunteer position with a typical
service load of a few hours per month, with higher loads around the
annual meeting held in February. Travel support is available to support
attendance at in-person meetings. Interested community members are 
encouraged to apply by June 15, 2022. 

https://forms.gle/ntuo2SGdpU1agbMx7

The application includes uploading a 1-page CV and providing a brief
(500-word max) statement describing why you are interested in serving
the Mercury community on the Steering Committee, as well as the
qualities and qualifications that you would bring to the committee.
Questions may be directed to mexag.sc@gmail.com.
