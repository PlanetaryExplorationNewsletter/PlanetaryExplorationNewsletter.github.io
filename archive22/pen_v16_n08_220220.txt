[NASA] RELEASE OF RESEARCH OPPORTUNITIES IN SPACE AND EARTH SCIENCES
(ROSES) 2022

NASA's Science Mission Directorate (SMD) announces the release of its
annual omnibus solicitation for basic and applied research, ROSES-2022,
as NNH22ZDA001N:

https://solicitation.nasaprs.com/ROSES2022

Electronic submission of proposals is required by the respective due
dates for each program element and must be submitted by an authorized
official of the proposing organization. Electronic proposals may be
submitted via the NASA proposal data system NSPIRES or via Grants.gov.

Every organization that intends to submit a proposal in response to
ROSES-2022 must be registered with NSPIRES; organizations that intend
to submit proposals via Grants.gov must be registered with Grants.gov,
in addition to being registered with NSPIRES. Such registration must
identify the authorized organizational representative(s) (AOR) who will
submit the electronic proposal. All proposal team members must be
registered in NSPIRES regardless of the submission system.

Potential proposers are strongly encouraged to read Section I(d) of the
ROSES Summary of Solicitation that lists Significant Changes from
Recent ROSES.

Questions concerning general ROSES-2022 policies and procedures may be
directed to Max Bernstein, Lead for Research, Science Mission
Directorate, at sara@nasa.gov.

[NASA] NASA FUNDAMENTAL PHYSICS RESEARCH SOLICITATION INFORMATIONAL 
MEETING

The NASA Fundamental Physics program is planning to solicit proposals
for ground-based research and flight experiments through a program
element of the annual Research Opportunities in Space and Earth
Sciences (ROSES) NRA.

The release of the program element is planned for late May 2022. A
virtual meeting will be held on March 29, 2022, from 11:00AM-1:00PM ET
to provide information on the solicitation and offer the research
community a forum to discuss the opportunity with NASA.

Proposals will be sought for research in atomic physics and quantum
science that is uniquely enabled by the space environment and takes
advantage of the space environment to conduct experiments in pursuit of
significant open questions in physics. Opportunities to use the Cold
Atom Laboratory with the planned Science Module 4 aboard the
International Space Station will be available through the solicitation.

Participants can register for the meeting at the following website:

https://forms.gle/5DgMaFEzLg7NSrCR9

Registrants will be sent connection information for the meeting and a 
link for information on the planned capabilities of Science Module 4.

Questions should be directed to Bradley M. Carpenter, Fundamental 
Physics Program Scientist at bcarpenter@nasa.gov.

CONFERENCE ANNOUNCEMENT FOR ERES VII

We are pleased to announce that the seventh Emerging Researchers in
Exoplanet Science (ERES) Symposium will take place August 1-2, 2022 at
Penn State!  

Researchers of all career stages working in all branches of
exoplanetary science and related disciplines are encouraged to attend -
though if necessary, preference will be given to early-career
participants (undergraduates, graduate students, and postdocs) in the
participant selection process.  

As networking is an important part of this conference, we are currently
planning to hold ERES VII in-person at Penn State, with partial virtual
support in the form of digital posters and live-streamed talks. We are
working to secure travel support for in-person attendees.  

We will continue to monitor the COVID-19 situation, and if it is
necessary to change the conference format, we will announce the change
no later than June 3, 2022.  

Registration, abstract submission, and applications for travel support
are open. Deadlines and more information can be found on the conference
website: 

https://sites.psu.edu/eres2022/ 

If you have any questions, please contact the Organizing Committee via
l-eres-2022-questions@lists.psu.edu.

THE LUNAR SURFACE INNOVATION CONSORTIUM (LSIC) - SPRING MEETING

Online and in person May 4-5, 2022, at Johns Hopkins Applied 
Physics Laboratory, Laurel, MD.

Abstracts Due: March 4
Registration Deadlines: 
April 6 (in-person)
April 25 (virtual attendance)

The LSIC 2022 Spring Meeting will concentrate on understanding NASA's
plans and technology investments relevant to building a sustained
presence on the lunar surface. The meeting will include invited
speakers, panels, posters, and breakout discussions.

LSIC invites abstracts describing technical capabilities within the six
LSIC focus areas, as well as those that identify lunar surface
technology needs and assess the readiness of relative systems and
components. Other topics of interest include defining the parameters
and constraints of the architecture required to support a sustained
presence on the lunar surface, as well as economic and policy
considerations. Abstracts are limited to 1 page in length, and should
clearly describe the technology or project aim, relevant methodologies,
and key findings or recommendations. Abstracts will be reviewed by the
technical organizing committee and, if accepted, may be selected for
presentation as a poster or a poster plus a lightning talk. Please use
the template file under "Related Documents" at:

GOLDSCHMIDT 2022 SESSION 01A: EXPET IN PLANETARY SCIENCE

Abstract submission deadline: March 1, 2022

https://2022.goldschmidt.info/goldschmidt/2022/cfp.cgi

Understanding the processes by which rocky planetary bodies
differentiated into a core, mantle, and crust, and how their resulting
attributes influenced subsequent geologic events and atmospheric
compositions is crucial to understanding the evolution of solar
systems. The aim of this session is to bring together diverse
perspectives from the various avenues of experimental petrology-centric
research within the overarching field of planetary sciences, in order
to spark big picture and interdisciplinary discussions.

We encourage submission from experimental petrology-centric research as
well as inclusion, diversity, equity, and accessibility efforts in the
field.

Keynote Speaker: Christina Richey, Jet Propulsion Laboratory

PLANETARY GEOLOGIC MAPPING WORKSHOP, JUNE 2022

We're offering a workshop in planetary geologic mapping, June 23 - July
1, in Flagstaff, AZ. This expenses-paid workshop, sponsored by NASA's
Topical Workshops, Symposia, and Conferences Program. Flagstaff is home
to the USGS Astrogeology Science Center, which coordinates the
publication of NASA-funded planetary geologic maps, and Lowell
Observatory, with its tradition in planetary discovery. The workshop
will be run out of the Northern Arizona University Astronomy and
Planetary Science Department.

Activities will include: pre-workshop exercises, in-classroom mapping,
field excursions, synthesis, and map presentation. More information
(including how to apply) is available at:

https://cefns.nau.edu/pgmw/

We welcome diversity, including individuals with different physical,
mental, or sensory abilities. Please see the FAQs page for more
information.

This workshop targets:
1) geology majors who will be juniors or seniors by Summer 2022 and are
   interested in understanding geology beyond Earth as part of their
   undergraduate or post-undergraduate career, 
2) graduate students interested in developing expertise in planetary 
   geologic mapping, and
3) early-career faculty and non-traditional students interested in
   expanding their skill sets to include planetary geologic mapping.

Members of groups historically underrepresented in planetary science
are encouraged to apply.
