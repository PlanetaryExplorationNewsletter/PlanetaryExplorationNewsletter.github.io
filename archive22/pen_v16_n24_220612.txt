POSTDOC AT STONY BROOK UNIVERSITY

Prof. Tim Glotch at Stony Brook University invites applications for a 
postdoctoral researcher to work on LRO Diviner data analysis. The 
application can be accessed at:

https://tinyurl.com/55vsur44

Duties: (In collaboration with the PI)

- Analyze data from the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter Diviner Lunar 
  Radiometer Experiment to assess the compositional, space weathering, 
  and thermophysical properties of the lunar surface.

GSA SESSION T94: GEOMORPHOLOGY AND LANDSCAPE EVOLUTION OF MARS

This session explores aeolian, fluvial, lacustrine, and crater 
degradation processes to investigate the geologic, geomorphic, and 
climatic histories of Mars. We welcome research utilizing orbital and 
rover data, as well as terrestrial analogues.

T94 is the only Mars geomorphology session being offered at GSA this 
year. We look forward to showcasing the research our community is 
involved in.

Abstracts are due July 19, 2022 23:59 MDT. GSA will be held in Denver, 
CO October 9-12, 2022. It is also a fully hybrid and accessible 
meeting.

GSA SSESSION T97: PLANETARY EXPLORAION AND EDUCATION

This session links how we teach and learn about the Solar System to how 
we gain that information (i.e., planetary exploration). Descriptions of 
outreach and educational efforts to bring planetary science to the 
public are encouraged. We welcome all abstracts related to planetary 
science and education. 

Abstracts due 19 July 2022, 11:59 p.m., MDT.

APPLY FOR CULTURALLY INCLUSIVE PLANETARY ENGAGEMENT WORKSHOP

Conducted by the NASA SMD Science Activation Planetary ReaCH project

Planetary scientists (including graduate students, post-doctoral 
researchers, engineers and technicians) and informal educators are 
invited to apply to attend a professional development workshop, 
Culturally Inclusive Planetary Engagement, August 4-6, 2022. Scientists 
and educators will work together in activities and conversations around 
diversity and inclusion. Participants will discuss ways to engage 
Latinx and Black communities in planetary science and exploration. 
Workshop participants come away with actionable strategies and hands-on 
activity ideas for engagement and the beginnings of relationships/
collaborations with other participants. Following the workshop, a 
public engagement event will allow workshop participants the 
opportunity to utilize engagement strategies discussed in the 
workshop.

Space is limited to 15 planetary scientists (incl. graduate students, 
post-doctoral researchers, and planetary engineers and technicians) and 
15 informal educators. Stipends are available for participants able to 
accept them.

The workshop will take place in Houston, August 4th (1 pm - 5 pm CDT) 
and August 5th (9 am - 5 pm CDT) with a community engagement event on 
August 6th.

To apply go to: 

https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/DMZ2765 

The deadline to apply is 5 pm CDT, June 30, 2022. More information:

TWO POST-DOC POSITIONS IN PLANETARY CLIMAGE AND PHOTOCHEMISTRY TO STUDY
THE PAST OF MARS AT LMD IN PARIS

At Laboratoire de Meteorologie Dynamique (LMD) inParis, we are 
developing new models to better understand the past environments of 
Mars. Two Postdoc positions are funded by the European Research Council 
under the "Mars Through Time" project for at least two years.

Contact: forget@lmd.ipsl.fr

1) Early Mars Climate

https://emploi.cnrs.fr/Offres/CDD/UMR8539-ISARIC-075/Default.aspx?lang=EN

The goal is to develop new models to understand the enigmatic early 
Mars environment that allowed the formation of lakes and rivers, in 
particular a hydrology model capable of calculating the evolution of 
lakes and glaciers over thousands of years.

The candidate should hold a PhD in climate or planetary sciences, 
ideally with an expertise in hydrology-cryology. Alternatively, 
experts on early Mars could be suitable.

2) Photochemistry:

https://emploi.cnrs.fr/Offres/CDD/UMR8539-ISARIC-074/Default.aspx?lang=EN

The goal is to adapt our photochemical models into the climate models 
to address burning questions such as: What was the chemical environment 
on Mars at other obliquities? Did Mars experience periods of oxidizing
conditions that destroyed possible subsurface bio-signatures? Did
photochemistry form greenhouse gases on early Mars?

The candidate should hold a PhD in atmospheric or planetary sciences,
ideally with skills in photochemistry and modeling.

CALL FOR PAPERS: "DRIVING TOWARDS A MORE DIVERSE SPACE PHYSICS RESEARCH 
COMMUNITY" IN FRONTIERS IN ASTRONOMY AND SPACE SCIENCE

Planetary researchers are encouraged to submit a paper for the open 
Research Topic, "Driving Towards a More Diverse Space Physics Research 
Community" in Frontiers in Astronomy and Space Science.

https://tinyurl.com/mr24s75t

Submissions are welcome that address opportunities offered by 
increasing diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) from a variety of 
angles. The scope encompasses papers that conduct statistical or 
narrative descriptions of the state of the international research 
community and its present culture, including demographics, 
interpersonal interactions, and organizational standards. It also 
includes papers that describe policies, processes, interventions, and 
actions that have yielded improvement in one or more aspects of DEI for 
the community. Personal stories that focus on actionable advice derived 
from those anecdotes are welcome.

We are expecting most submissions to be short Opinion and Perspective 
articles (<2K or <3K words).

Manuscript submission deadline: 31 August 2022

Indicate your intention to submit an article at the URL above
