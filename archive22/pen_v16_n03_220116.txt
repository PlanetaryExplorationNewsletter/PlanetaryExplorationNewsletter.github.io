ABSCICON 2022 SESSION: PREPARING FOR IN-SITU LIFE-DETECTIO AND 
HABITABILITY INVESTIGATIONS THROUGH MODELLING, LABORATORY, AND FIELD
ANALOG EXPERIMENTS

Abstract Submission deadline January 19, 2022.

https://agu.confex.com/agu/abscicon21/prelim.cgi/Session/112000

The search for biosignatures and indicators of habitable environments 
is a major goal of space exploration, but the expression (and 
preservation) of these signatures on planetary bodies can strongly 
depend on local conditions. Since each planetary target presents 
unique challenges, studies are often initiated to replicate these 
unique environments and thereby evaluate biosignature expression and 
potential detection strategies. This session invites papers on 
experimental, theoretical, or field analog studies that support 
existing or future in-situ investigations of planetary bodies (e.g.,
Europa, Enceladus, Mars, Ceres), and focus on processes by which 
biosignatures or key organic indicators can be degraded (e.g.,
radiation, oxidation, UV exposure, impact/shock processes, etc.) or 
preserved.

ABSCICON 2022 SESSION: OCEAN WORLD OBSERVATIONS IN ASTROBIOLOGY
- REMOTE STUDIES WITH GROUND AND SPACE OBSERVATORIES

https://agu.confex.com/agu/abscicon21/prelim.cgi/Session/111828

Abstracts Due January 19, 2022

Missions throughout the Solar System have dramatically revised our 
understanding of Astrobiology. Multiple lines of evidence now point to 
interior oceans in multiple bodies including Enceladus, Titan, and 
Galilean satellites. Moreover, Dawn at Ceres and New Horizons flyby of 
Pluto have hinted at liquid interiors in these dwarf planets. Remote 
sensing with ground and space-based observatories: including Hubble, 
Keck, ALMA and others offer capabilities that are complementary to 
planetary missions, but also offer long-term studies, statistical 
samples, and comparable planetology across multiple bodies. 
Additionally, the only capability for ocean world studies beyond our 
Solar System are limited to the enhanced capabilities and new 
technologies being implemented in observatories. In the future, the 
promise of facilities such as JWST and thirty-meter class telescopes 
for further discovery is enticing. This session solicits contributions 
focusing on observations of astrobiologically interesting targets, from 
missions to terrestrial telescopes, with the intention of promoting 
synergistic science.

ABSCICON 2022 SESSION: ATMOSPHERIC ESCAPE AND EVOLUTION AT 
TERRETRIAL PLANETS

Abstract submission: 

https://agu.confex.com/agu/abscicon21/prelim.cgi/Session/141161

Submission deadline: January 19

Atmospheric composition is a key aspect of a planet's habitability. 
However, the present-day composition tells only a fraction of the story 
of a planet's atmosphere and, given the large timescales involved in 
the evolution of planetary conditions and a possible biosphere, it is 
necessary to understand the evolution of an atmosphere through time in 
order to understand the past history of ambient conditions necessary to 
harbor life. Furthermore, understanding the atmospheric escape 
processes in present-day atmospheres provides an important insight not 
only into the future of these planets, but also serve as proxies to 
understand the evolution of exoplanetary atmospheres by informing 
atmospheric models. This session invites contributions that use models 
and data to understand the evolution of past, present and future 
atmospheres, as well as the description of measurement ideas and 
mission concepts to address these important questions.

DUE DATE

The Citizen Science Seed Funding Program (CSSFP; F.9 of ROSES-2021) 
aims to incubate citizen science projects as they are being conceived 
or during critical transitions, like the year when they are first 
launched or beta tested (i.e., when the first group of volunteers is 
invited to try the project) or when the project changes scientific 
direction. The Science/Technical/Management section of CSSFP is limited 
to 6 pages. CSSFP awards will have a duration of up to one year only.

Proposals are now due February 15, 2022.

COSPAR SESSION B4.2: MARS SCIENCE RESULTS

Abstracts are currently being accepted for the Mars Science Results
Session (COSPAR-22-B4.2) at the 44th COSPAR Scientific Assembly (16-24
July 2022, hybrid - Athens, Greece and virtual).

Session Description:

Mars has been extensively studied using spacecraft data, theoretical 
modeling, laboratory studies, and comparative planetology over the last 
several decades. As of the conference, there are expected to be eight 
operating orbiters (ODY, MEx, MRO, MAVEN, MOM, TGO, Hope, and the 
Tianwen-1 orbiter), and three operating rovers (Curiosity, Perseverance, 
and the Tianwen-1 rover). These spacecraft are exploring Mars' 
atmosphere, surface, and subsurface to understand the planet's history 
and habitability.

This session will address new science resulting from these missions and 
other recent missions, as well as studies reliant on theory, modeling, 
laboratory studies, and comparative planetology. This session will
include a combination of solicited and contributed presentations, with 
a focus on international diversity. Abstract deadline is 11 February 
2022 at 23:59 UTC. Abstracts may be submitted at:

COSPAR SESSION B4.3: FORWARD PLANNING FOR THE EXPLORATION OF MARS

Abstracts are currently being accepted for the Session Forward Planning 
for the Exploration of Mars (COSPAR-22-B4.3) at the 44th COSPAR 
Scientific Assembly (16-24 July 2022, hybrid - Athens, Greece and 
virtual).

Session Description:

Mars continues to be a compelling planetary exploration target in spite 
of, or perhaps even because of, the large number of prior and ongoing 
missions. The findings of each mission are typically met with an equal 
or greater number of questions raised to be answered by future 
missions. This session focuses on forward planning for the exploration 
of Mars including: 1) future hypothesis-driven or discovery-driven 
science instruments or missions and 2) The precursors that may help us 
prepare for future human missions. Topics of interest include the 
primary scientific drivers that require future missions to Mars, recent 
developments in our engineering and technological capabilities related 
to missions to Mars, an updated understanding of current mission 
concepts, and candidate instrumentation for future missions.

This session will include a combination of solicited and contributed 
presentations, with a focus on international diversity.

Abstract deadline is 11 February 2022 at 23:59 UTC. Abstracts may be
submitted at:

COSPAR SESSION B4.4: MARS SAMPLE RETURN

Abstracts are currently being accepted for the Mars Sample Return
Session (COSPAR-22-B4.4) at the 44th COSPAR Scientific Assembly (16-24
July 2022, hybrid - Athens, Greece and virtual).

Session Description:

NASA and ESA have embarked on a highly collaborative endeavor to return 
samples from Mars. A fundamental premise of this partnership is that 
scientists working around the world would share access to the samples 
such that the scientific benefits and discoveries are maximized. 
Progress in this international endeavor will be presented, including 
the progress Perseverance has made collecting samples in Jezero Crater, 
the planned mission architecture for returning the samples from Mars, 
and planning for analysis of the samples when they are returned to 
Earth. In addition, there will be presentations of recent of Mars 
Sample Return Science Planning Group reports. The challenges of 
ensuring the best international science is accomplished, while adhering 
to planetary protection requirements will be discussed. Contributions 
to this session are sought to reflect international interest in sample 
return and its potential scientific benefits.

Abstract deadline is 11 February 2022 at 23:59 UTC. Abstracts may be
