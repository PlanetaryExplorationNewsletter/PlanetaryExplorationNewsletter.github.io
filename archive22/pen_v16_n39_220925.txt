GERALD A. SOFFEN MEMORIAL TRAVEL GRANTS

The Gerald A. Soffen Memorial Fund is pleased to announce the Fall 2022 
Travel Grant application opportunity for undergraduate and graduate 
students pursuing studies in fields of space science and engineering. 

The Travel Grants enable student recipients to attend professional 
conferences to present their research. Recipients may use the Grant for 
either virtual or in-person conferences. The Soffen Fund will award up 
to $1000 in total, with no individual award greater than $500, to cover 
expenses related to presenting research at either a virtual or in-person 
conference. The number of awards will depend on applicants' needs.

The Fall 2022 Travel Grant application deadline is October 7, 2022. 
Jerry Soffen, a biologist by training, led a distinguished career in 
NASA, including serving as the Project Scientist for Viking and as an 
architect for the NASA Astrobiology Institute. The Travel Grant 
continues Jerry's dedication to educating and involving future 
generations in space science and engineering pursuits. 

The electronic application materials and instructions are located on 
the Soffen Fund website:

[NASA] ROSES-22: F.10 PRISM FINAL TEXT AND DUE DATES

This third Payloads and Research Investigations on the Surface of the 
Moon (PRISM) program element solicits proposals for an investigation 
that include development and flight of science-driven suites of 
instruments that will be delivered to the lunar surface by the 
Commercial Lunar Payload Services (CLPS). This PRISM call is for 
science investigations that will be delivered to the lunar surface in 
mid-Calendar Year CY27. This delivery will go to a safe landing site 
(see Section 3.2) identified and justified by the proposer that 
resides within 75 degrees of the lunar equator. Both nearside and far 
side destinations are open to consideration. This PRISM call provides 
the opportunity to leverage survive-the-night services and mobility 
services provided by the CLPS provider. Further details for each of 
these services are included in the text.

Program changes includes the removal of sample acquisition as a 
CLPS-provided service.

Step-1 proposals are due October 24, 2022, and Step-2 proposals are 
due December 20, 2022.

https://solicitation.nasaprs.com/ROSES2022

Questions and comments concerning PRISM may be directed to Debra 
Needham and Ryan Watkins at HQ-PRISM@mail.nasa.gov.

PHD POSITION: EXPERIMENTAL SPACE RESEARCH

The Space Research and Planetology Division, University of Bern, 
Switzerland, is seeking a PhD student to join the group for the JUICE 
mission to Jupiter and its icy moons. We are participating in the JUICE 
mission with a neutral gas and ion mass spectrometer (NIM), which will 
measure the chemical composition of the atmospheres of Jupiter's icy 
moons: Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto. Experience with laboratory 
techniques, vacuum instrumentation, ion-optical simulation, 
electronics, and mass spectrometry would be of advantage. Several 
tests, and calibrations with the flight spare instrument and the ground 
reference instrument are planned, using fast neutral beams and 
low-energy ion beams. Measurement modes will have to be defined and 
operations will have to be planned. 

The position is available from 1 December 2022. Candidates with 
demonstrated experience in experimental work will be favoured. The 
salary is in accordance with the personnel regulations of the Canton 
of Bern. Submit your application by 16 October 2022 as a single pdf 
file consisting of a cover letter describing your motivation and 
qualifications for the position, a CV, list of your publications, and 
names of three references.

of comparative planetology - are especially encouraged, as are those 
that leverage Earth analogs.

Letter-length, long-form, and review articles are all appropriate. 
Examples of themes include but are not limited to geomorphology, 
geologic surface processes, tectonics, exploration, aeolian studies, 
geologic mapping, chronostratigraphy, and spectroscopy.

The normal fee for Open Access publication is 2500 CHF (Swiss Francs; 
**roughly** $2700 USD, 2000 GBP, $3500 CAN; 2500 EUR). However, the 
publication fee will be waived or discounted by 30-50% for certain 
articles deemed especially high-impact.

RMS NODE USERS GROUP DURING DPS MEETING

Date: Tuesday, October 4, at 3:40pm Eastern = 12:40pm Pacific (please 
ignore 3:30pm time in block schedule)

This will be a hybrid meeting at the DPS Meeting in London ON, Canada, 
and also accessible via Zoom. The meeting will take up to two hours. 

The PDS Ring-Moon Systems Node (RMS) hosts data and tools in which the 
focus is on rings, moons, and/or their primary bodies viewed as a 
dynamical system. Our user community includes researchers interested in 
icy satellite surfaces and planetary atmospheres, in addition to 
researchers interested in rings and other dynamical systems. 

This meeting is an opportunity for friends of the PDS Ring-Moon Systems 
Node to hear us report on RMS Node updates and accomplishments during 
the past year, and for us to solicit your feedback regarding how we 
should proceed. 
 
Those attending the DPS Meeting are welcome to join us in person. 

For remote attendees, the Zoom coordinates and agenda will be sent by 
email. To be added to our list, please contact Matt Tiscareno
