POST-DOCTORAL SCHOLARSHIP (TWO YEARS) IN MODELING PLASMA INTERACTION 
WITH PLANETARY BODIES

The Department of Physics at Umea University in Sweden is offering a 
post-doctoral scholarship in modeling plasma interaction with planetary 
bodies. The scholarship is full-time for two years and the start date 
will be 15 February, 2023, or by agreement. The aim of our project is 
to advance our current understanding on the kinetic interaction 
between the solar wind and planetary bodies of different sizes and

Planetary science and exploration subject matter experts (SMEs; 
including graduate students, post-doctoral researchers, engineers, and 
technicians) are invited to apply to attend a Planetary Resources and 
Content Heroes (ReaCH) workshop to learn strategies for engaging 
diverse audiences, specifically Black and Latinx youth and their 
families, in planetary science and exploration. SMEs will be joined by 
local informal, or out-of-school time, educators.

During the workshop, planetary scientists and informal educators 
team-up to:

- Learn and share effective practices and strategies to engage Black 
  and Latinx communities
- Collaborate with and learn from each other, sharing their expertise 
  in planetary science and engaging diverse audiences
- Practice engagement strategies at a community event on Saturday,

VENUS COMMUNITY INPUT REQUEST

On September, 7, 2022, NASA released its fifth Community Announcement 
Advanced Notice regarding the forthcoming release of the New Frontiers 
5 (NF5) Announcement of Opportunity:

https://tinyurl.com/nhcsfam2

In the announcement, the "Venus In Situ Explorer" ("VISE") theme was 
omitted from the list of allowed Mission Themes.

VEXAG has requested from the NF5 program office clarification of, and 
rationale for, this change.

As the Venus Assessment Group, we seek the thoughts and inputs of the 
Venus science and technology communities regarding the announcement, 
so that we may accurately represent your views to the upcoming CAPS 
meeting in late September, and to NASA as they gather feedback for 
the NF5 Draft AO.

A Google form for comments is here:

https://tinyurl.com/4f98efha

We hope to compile feedback and discuss by Friday September 23, 2022 
ahead of the CAPS meeting. We'll accept later responses, but can't 
guarantee we'll be able to consider them before CAPS.

Noam Izenberg, Chair, OBO the VEXAG Steering Committee

[NASA] ROSES-22 AMENDMENT 46: F.14 TRANSFORM TO OPEN SCIENCE TRAINING 
FINAL TEXT AND DUE DATE

F.14 Transform to OPen Science Training (TOPST) solicits proposals to 
advance open science literacy for all who do research on topics 
relevant to NASA's Science Mission Directorate (SMD) through training 
and workshops targeting audiences from undergraduate students to 
established scientists and managers. NASA developed an Open Science 
curricula, OpenCore, a core curricula that introduces open science to 
a general community. OpenCore is the initial phase of TOPST material. 
The second phase is ScienceCore, a curriculum of discipline-specific 
materials that showcase open-science workflows. This element will 
support three types of activities: (1) development of ScienceCore 
materials, (2) implementation of summer schools, and (3) virtual 
cohorts.

NASA TOPS staff will host an informational session on F.14 TOPST 
during their regular monthly Community Forum on October 13, 2022 at 1 
PM ET / 10AM PT. Please register and sign up to the TOPS email list 
for additional information.

JOB OPENING AT NASA JPL: RESEARCH SCIENTIST, MARS CLIMATE SOUNDER TEAM

The Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, invites 
applications for a newly created research position in the Planetary 
and Exoplanetary Atmospheres Group. The research will involve 
investigations with the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO) for science 
planning and analysis tasks involving the Mars Climate Sounder (MCS) 
instrument. A scientist is particularly needed to plan special 
observations on a campaign basis, such as coordinated observations 
with other spacecraft experiments. The successful candidate will be 
part of the Mars Climate Sounder team. Scientific analysis will be 
focused on cloud observations by the MCS, using radiative-transfer 
programs to determine the composition of clouds in the atmosphere of 
Mars. The research will also entail management and maintenance of the 
citizen-science project "Cloudspotting on Mars" on the "Zooniverse" 
platform that enables the identification of clouds in MCS data by 
citizen scientists. This work involves both data management/analysis 
and interactions with citizen scientists via online communications and 
webinars. In addition, the successful candidate will support the Mars 
Sample Return Program office on risk reduction efforts such as optical 
search scenario modeling.

#EDIALPS

We invite planetary scientists in leadership roles to join us for a 
pilot workshop designed to engage participants with EDIA concepts and 
strategies. "Leadership" includes: Mission and instrument PIs (and 
future PIs), department chairs, institute directors, program officers, 
and group leaders of all kinds. The goal of this workshop is to give 
participants the basic tools they need to begin to enact positive 
change in their personal and professional spheres regarding inclusion, 
diversity, access, and equity. The meeting will be entirely on-line 
with no registration fee. 

The workshop leaders will be Drs. Julie Rathbun and JA Grier. Dr. 
Grier will be presenting more information about the conference at 
this year's DPS meeting. Their poster presentation will be Tuesday, 
October 4 at 4 pm Eastern time.
