EPSC SESSION OPS2: EXPLORATION OF TITAN

The Europlanet Science Congress (EPSC) 2022 will be held in Granada,
Spain, 18-23 September 2022 - in person!

We'd like to direct your attention to the session OPS2: Exploration of
Titan.

Conveners: Alice Le Gall, Anezina Solomonidou Co-conveners: Ralph
Lorenz, Conor Nixon, Marco Mastroguiseppe, Sandrine Vinatier

Session Description: Saturn's moon Titan, despite its satellite status,
has nothing to envy to planets: it has planetary dimensions, a
substantial and dynamic atmosphere, a carbon cycle, a variety of
geological features (dunes, lakes, rivers, mountains and more),
seasons, and a hidden ocean. It even has its own mission, Dragonfly,
selected in the frame of NASA's New Frontiers program. In this session,
scientific presentations are solicited to cover all aspects of current
research on Titan, from its interior to its upper atmosphere, using
data collected from the Cassini-Huygens mission (2004-2017) and/or from
ground-based telescopes (e.g., ALMA) and/or based on modelling and
experimental efforts to support the interpretation of past and future
observations of this unique world.

https://meetingorganizer.copernicus.org/EPSC2022/session/44576

Abstract submission deadline is 18 May 2022, 13:00 CEST.

JOB ANNOUNCEMENT - ORGANIC ANALYSES AT NASA JSC

This is an informal heads-up announcement for a job opening in organics
analyses at JSC. The Astromaterials Research Office, part of the
Astromaterials Research and Exploration Science (ARES) Division of the
Exploration Integration and Science Directorate, NASA Johnson Space
Center, anticipates filling a Planetary Scientist civil service
position during 2022. This position involves study of the origin,
composition, structure, and evolution of organic material in
astromaterial samples including meteorites, asteroids, and planetary
bodies. We seek a Planetary Scientist with expertise in
organics-focused analyses of planetary materials using spectroscopy,
spectrometry, or other techniques with demonstrated expertise in making
both in situ and ex situ measurements. The successful candidate will be
expected to support their research program by attracting funds through
peer-reviewed proposals to NASA programs and/or through involvement in
NASA planetary missions.

All candidates must use the USAJobs.gov website to prepare and submit
applications, and United States citizenship is required to be eligible
for this civil service position. Informal inquiries may be sent to Dr.
Justin Filiberto, Manager, Astromaterials Research Office,
justin.r.filiberto@nasa.gov. This application is scheduled to open on
(or around) April 27.

CANADA EXCELLENCE RESEARCH CHAIR IN COSMOCHEMICAL PLANETARY EXPLORATION 
AT YORK UNIVERSITY

York University invites applications from outstanding researchers for
appointment of up to three Canada Excellence Research Chairs (CERC) in
areas of strategic focus including Cosmochemical Planetary Exploration.

The CERC program is designed to recruit the world's top researchers to
Canada and is the country's most prestigious federally funded research
chair program. Appointments to a Canada Excellence Research Chair are
for 8 years and are accompanied by an award of either $500,000 or $1
million per year over the term of the chair. Successful candidates will
be appointed to a full-time tenure-stream faculty position at the rank
of Associate or Full Professor. All CERC appointments are subject to
review and approval by the CERC Secretariat, expected in Spring 2023.

The successful candidate will support space missions under the Centre 
for Research in Earth and Space Science (CRESS) and expand the scope of

SPIRIT MARS EXPLORATION ROVER TARGETS NOW AVAILABLE IN MARS TARGET
ENCYCLOPEDIA

The Mars Target Encyclopedia (MTE) aims to collect in one place
information about observational targets (e.g., rocks, soils) identified
and named during Mars surface exploration. The MTE links targets
publications that provide information (e.g., composition, provenance,
interpretation) about each target. Version 2.0 of the MTE was recently
released and includes targets from the Spirit Mars Exploration Rover,
adding to the MTE's coverage of the Mars Pathfinder and Mars Phoenix
Lander missions. Users can search for targets with particular
composition (e.g., "sulfur", "hematite") or properties such as
"layered" or "andesitic". The MTE database is available at:

https://tinyurl.com/2auc6ydv

More information about the latest release, including cross-mission
comparisons, is available at:

https://www.hou.usra.edu/meetings/lpsc2022/pdf/1231.pdf

Current work on the MTE is funded by a NASA PDART grant and is a
collaboration between the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory and the
University of Utah.
