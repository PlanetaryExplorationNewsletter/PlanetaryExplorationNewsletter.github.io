REPORT RELEASE AND PUBLIC BRIEFING: PLANETARY SCIENCE AND ASTROBIOLOGY
DECADAL SURVEY

What new discoveries are on the horizon for the next decade of
planetary exploration? The Planetary Science and Astrobiology Decadal
Survey 2023-2032 highlights key science questions, identifies priority
missions, and presents a comprehensive research strategy that includes
both planetary defense and human exploration. The report also
recommends ways to support the profession as well as the technologies
and infrastructure needed to carry out the science.

Learn more about the decadal survey by joining the National Academies
for a public briefing on Tuesday, April 19, 2022 from 2-4pm ET. During
the briefing, members of the committee will discuss the report's key
findings and take questions from the audience.

Please note that this event will be held mostly online, but we are able
to accommodate a limited number of in-person participants at our
building in Washington, DC.

MEETING POSTPONEMENT: CHAPMAN CONFERENCE ON ALFVEN WAVES

Due to health and safety concerns, restrictions on international
travel, we have made the decision to move the dates of the onsite
conference in Berlin, Germany, to May/June 2023 (exact dates will be
announced later). We hope that this change will enable researchers
from around the world to participate in person in this
interdisciplinary conference.

The Program Committee continues its work on the conference, entitled
"Advances in Understanding Alfven Waves in the Sun and the
Heliosphere", and will provide updates in this newsletter as
information becomes available, including a hyperlink to the conference
website.

With best wishes,
The Organizers

THE 6TH BEIJING EARTH AND PLANETARY INTERIORS SYMPOSIUM

The 6th Beijing Earth and Planetary Interiors Symposium (BEPIS) will be
held on August 7-9, 2022. The 6th BEPIS focuses on observational and
theoretical advances in geomagnetism, paleomagnetism, rock magnetism,
environmental magnetism, biogeomagnetism, geodynamo theories and
models, technique and instrument development and their applications in
Earth and planetary sciences. Remaining true to original aspiration,
the 6th BEPIS will aim to promote understanding of the origin,
structure, and variations of magnetic fields of the Earth, Moon, Mars
and other planets as well as planetary habitability.

Due to the pandemic, the 6th BEPIS will be held as a hybrid conference.
The offline meeting will be in the Institute of Geology and Geophysics,
Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing. The online meeting will be
synchronized with ZOOM meetings. The symposium is free of registration
charges.

ROSSBYPALOOZA 2022: CLOUDS AND CONVECTION IN DIVERSE CLIMATES

July 11-22, University of Chicago, Chicago, IL

https://www.rossbypalooza.org/rossby2022/

The Department of the Geophysical Sciences at the University of Chicago
is pleased to announce the return of Rossbypalooza - a two-week,
project-oriented summer school for graduate students and postdocs from
a broad field including atmospheric, oceanic, and planetary sciences.
The summer school will consist of lectures and group projects where
participants will address scientific questions of their choice,
mentored by faculty members.

Rossbypalooza 2022 Topic: Clouds and convection are key components and
one of the major sources of uncertainty in the climate system. Given
the strong coupling of clouds to dynamics, radiation, and microphysics,
there is a great need for theoretical, observational, and modeling
advancements.

All participants must be fully vaccinated unless they have an
authorized exemption. Accommodations, including breakfast and lunch,
will be provided.

Applications can be submitted before April 22 through this Google Form:

https://tinyurl.com/r7xzcb9x

Note that a CV, research statement (maximum 300 words), and statement
of purpose (maximum of 200 words) are required to apply.

We expect to make acceptance decisions by May 6, 2022.

BOOK: CERES - AN ICE-RICH WORLD IN THE INNER SOLAR SYSTEM

Authors: Jian-Yang Li, Julie C. Castillo-Rogez

Dwarf planet Ceres is becoming a new research focus in the recent field
of ocean worlds science due to the possible existence of liquid water
in its interior. It is the only large, water-rich body that has been
characterized in detail thanks to NASA's Dawn mission. This book
provides a thorough review of the current state of knowledge about
Ceres after the Dawn mission. It starts with a historical overview of
the exploration of Ceres before Dawn, from its discovery in the 19th
century to extensive characterization with telescopic research. After
an overview of the Dawn mission, this book synthesizes various aspects
of Dawn's discoveries, including surface composition, geology,
expressions of water ice, interior structure, and recent activity. The
astrobiological significance of Ceres inferred from this new knowledge
is then addressed. The book concludes with a summary of open questions
and motivations for follow-on research and exploration.

As the sixth volume in the Advances in Planetary Science series, this
book is intended to be a primary reference for Ceres for planetary
scientists and graduate students.
