[NASA] SMD: DELAY IN DYNAMIC AO RELEASE

NASA's Science Mission Directorate (SMD) is delaying the release of 
the draft Dynamical Neutral Atmosphere-Ionosphere Coupling (DYNAMIC) 
mission solicitation due to reduced budget availability anticipated at 
this time.

Further information specific to DYNAMIC will be posted on the 
Acquisition Homepage as it becomes available:

https://soma.larc.nasa.gov/STP/DYNAMIC/

NASA has not approved the issuance of the DYNAMIC AO and this 
notification does not obligate NASA to issue the AO and solicit 
proposals. Any costs incurred by prospective investigators in 
preparing submissions in response to a DYNAMIC AO are incurred 
completely at the submitter's own risk.

Any questions about the DYNAMIC delay should be directed via email 
only using subject line "DYNAMIC NNH22ZDA004L" to:

Dr. Jared Leisner, 
Solar Terrestrial Probes Program Lead Program Scientist, Heliophysics 
Division, Science Mission Directorate, NASA, Washington, DC 20546; 
jared.s.leisner@nasa.gov.

Depending on the nature of the question(s)/comments, NASA may respond 
on an individual basis by email or may post responses at the Q&A 
section of DYNAMIC Acquisition Homepage. The anonymity of 
persons/institutions who submit questions/comments will be preserved.
