Abstract deadline: February 23, 2022

This session focuses on the recent progress and advances in studying 
meteor bodies and phenomena made in the Pan-Pacific region and beyond. 
As meteor science connects many disciplines such as planetary 
astronomy, atmospheric science, and planetary geology, with this 
session we hope to stimulate discussion among researchers from 
different institutions and countries working in different fields, and 
to foster potential collaborations therein. Contributions in all 
topics related to meteor science are welcome.

VEXAG LPSC STUDENT GRANT ANNOUNCEMENT 

Attention Venus Science Undergraduates and Post-Bacs:

In light of the significant registration cost increase for this year's 
(2022) Lunar and Planetary Science Conference, VEXAG is creating a 
registration reimbursement award in the form of a Travel Grant for 
students in need. Over 50 students have submitted Venus related 
abstracts to LPSC this year, and unfortunately we can't help everyone. 
VEXAG is dedicating funds for up to 10 awards of $300 each to defray 
the cost of either in-person or virtual registration. We ask that 
interested students provide a short justification/statement of need 
along with abstract information. If more than 10 students meet 
qualifications, ten awardees will be randomly selected from that pool.

Regretfully, this award is only available to US citizens or Green Card 
holders.

We ask that students in need of aid fill out the Travel Grant award 
request form at the link below. Deadline for submission is Friday, 
February 25, 2022. Decisions will be made in the first half of the 
following week and students notified just before or during LPSC. 
Awards will be issued following the meeting.

Grant application at the VEXAG Website:

LPI WEBINAR: SHARING PLANETARY SCIENCE - DE-JARGONING YOUR TALKS

Tuesday, February 15 at 3:00 p.m. CST

There are many ways to say things. We often default to using jargon, 
but these words or phrases may be meaningless to your audience; worse, 
hearing a presentation with jargon may cause your audience to lose 
interest. Join us to hear from Dr. Olivia Ambrogio (AGU), Steven Smith 
(NASA), and Christine Shupla (LPI), who will discuss strategies that 
will help you to identify and avoid jargon.
