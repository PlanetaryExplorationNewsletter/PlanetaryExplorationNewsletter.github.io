PHD OPPORTUNITIES IN INTERDISCIPLINARY SPACE SCIENCES AND PLANETARY 
RESEARCH

The Young Researcher Program YRP@Graz welcomes applications for 3 PhD 
positions. YRP@Graz is jointly supported by the Austrian Academy of 
Sciences, the Graz University of Technology, and the University of 
Graz.

The application process has two stages with which we aim to decrease 
selection biases:
 -Stage 1 applications are submitted through an anonymised form 
  (deadline: July 1st)
 -Stage 2 selected applicants are invited for an interview.

Our expectations for our candidates:
 -We look for early career researchers who are interested in an 
  interdisciplinary exchange based on a solid university education in 
  at least one subject of natural sciences or engineering.
 -We aim for PhD candidates who would like to actively join our 
  YRP@Graz initiative, helping to develop the tradition of the involved 
  institutes.
 -We look for excellent researchers who have the courage to cross 
  scientific borders in a responsible way and to support our 
  international societies with their research.
 -We search for team players who aspire to continue their skill 
  development as well as to support the research location Graz.

address astrobiology research questions related to life detection. A 
focus of the work will be utilizing Laser Induced Breakdown 
Spectroscopy which is part of an instrument payload we are studying 
for ocean world mission applications. The candidate will also conduct 
laboratory simulations of prebiotic chemistry in hydrothermal mineral 
systems. The candidate will lead completion of specific tasks for 
ongoing projects and will have the opportunity to develop their own 
research plans.

Required qualifications: Candidates should have a recent PhD in 
geology, geochemistry, oceanography, or related fields. The ideal 
candidate will be enthusiastic about astrobiology and in being a 
collaborative member of a lab group that studies how life emerges and 
thrives in planetary environments. Desired qualifications: Experience 
with geochemistry analytical techniques, particularly ion 
chromatography; willingness to become proficient in LIBS.
