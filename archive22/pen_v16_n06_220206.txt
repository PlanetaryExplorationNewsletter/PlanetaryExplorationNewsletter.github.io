IN MEMORIAM: PAUL FELDMAN (1939-2022)

Paul Feldman, a pioneer of comet science, died at home on January 26, 
2022 at the age of 82. 

"Feldman's work was notable for its great breadth and depth, said 
Harold (Hal) Weaver, research professor in the department, principal 
professional staff at Hopkins' Applied Physics Laboratory, and a former 
student of Feldman's. Feldman first ventured into the field of 
cometary science with an ultraviolet sounding rocket experiment to 
observe the Comet Kohoutek in 1974, and made an inventory of the 
hydrogen, oxygen, and carbon abundances in the comet's coma. For the 
rest of his career, he was what Weaver describes as a 'planetary 
archaeologist,' investigating the origin and evolution of our solar 
system."

He did groundbreaking work in the fields of planetary and satellite 
atmospheres and astronomical instrumentation. Using sounding rockets, 
he studied "the Earth's upper atmosphere, the aurora and the airglow, 
the atmospheres of comets and planets, the spectra of hot stars, and 
cosmic background radiation." 

Quotations are a small sample from a more extensive article 
detailing Feldman's broad achievements:

[NASA] PDS: CATALINA SKY SURVEY

The Catalina Sky Survey (CSS) data are now available in the PDS 
archive. CSS is an ongoing survey using multiple telescopes in Arizona 
and Australia to discover and follow-up Near Earth Objects (NEOs). CSS 
nightly data are delivered each day into the PDS archive starting with 
the night of January 20, 2022. Earlier data from CSS will also be 
delivered into the archive on an irregular schedule.

To access the CSS data directly:

https://sbn.psi.edu/pds/resource/css.html

In January 2022, PDS ingested and made available the following data,
none of which were regularly released with an ongoing mission:

- 2022.01.31 Catalina Sky Survey
- 2022.01.20 Asteroid Polarimetric Database V2.0

AGU CHAPMAN CONFERENCE ON ADVANCES IN UNDERSTANDING ALFVEN WAVES IN THE
SUN AND THE HELIOSPHERE

Berlin, Germany 
August 21-26, 2022 (in-person)
 
This interdisciplinary conference aims to bring together scientists to 
review and discuss the current state of research on Alfven waves in 
space plasmas, including the solar atmosphere, the solar wind, 
planetary magnetospheres and ionospheres, and laboratory plasmas (if 
relevant to space plasmas). The conference will take place in Berlin 
(in person), one of the most iconic cities in Europe with a history of 
over 750 years, and one of the trendiest vacation destinations in 
Europe (to quote a couple of travel websites).

The following science sessions will be organized:

- Alfven wave generation mechanisms
- Alfven wave propagation and coupling
- Alfven wave interactions with plasma and energetic particles
- Alfven wave applications in Solar System plasmas

Further information about abstract submission, registration and 
conference hotel will be provided in a forthcoming conference website.

OBTAIN A QUOTATION FROM SMALL AND/OR MINORITY BUSINESSES, WOMEN'S 
BUSINESS ENTERPRISES AND LABOR SURPLUS AREA FIRMS

Comments Due: February 10, 2022

https://tinyurl.com/2p8uf93a

In response to the Executive Order, Advancing Racial Equity and Support 
for Underserved Communities Through the Federal Government, NASA has 
been working to identify and address barriers that underserved 
communities and individuals may face in taking advantage of procurement, 
contracting, or grant opportunities.

The Grants Policy and Compliance Branch (GPC) in the National 
Aeronautics and Space Administration's (NASA) Office of the Chief 
Financial Officer is soliciting public comment on the Agency's proposed 
implementation of a new term and condition that requires recipients of 
NASA financial assistance to obtain a quotation from small and/or 
minority businesses, women's business enterprises or labor surplus area 
firms when the acquisition of goods or services exceeds the simplified 
acquisition threshold (currently $250,000).

The new terms and conditions will be applied to all new NASA awards and 
funding amendments to existing awards made on or after the effective 
date.

LEAG CLOC-SAT COMMUNITY KICK-OFF

We are pleased to announce a community kickoff on behalf on the LEAG 
Continuous Lunar Orbital Capabilities - Specific Action Team 
(CLOC-SAT). This short workshop will be held on February 15, from 2:30 
- 5:00 pm EST.

The goals of the workshop are to gauge community interest in and 
support for continuous lunar orbital capabilities and to stimulate 
community discussion that will result in follow-up input to the 
CLOC-SAT Team. The kick-off session will have four invited speakers 
providing perspectives on different aspects of this topic. The speakers 
will be followed by breakout discussions for input from the broader 
community. These discussion sessions will focus on the interwoven "why" 
(unanswered science and exploration goals and objectives, "what" 
(observations and measurements to address the objectives), and "how" 
(architectures and implementation needs over the next decades). After 
the kick-off, we encourage community members to prepare and submit 
diverse and thoughtful 'white papers' that will feed into the CLOC-SAT 
report.

Registration is free, but is required to ensure you receive virtual 
connection information and agenda for the kickoff. Go to:
