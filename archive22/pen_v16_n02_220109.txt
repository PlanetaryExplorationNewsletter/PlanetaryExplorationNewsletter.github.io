ABSCICON 2022 SESSION: ORIGINS, INVENTORIES, AND GEOLOGIC SETTINGS OF 
THE BUILDING BLOCKS OF LIFE

Abstract Submission Deadline: January 19, 2022.

https://agu.confex.com/agu/abscicon21/prelim.cgi/Session/111949

The prebiotic inventory of the early Earth established the foundation
for subsequent complex organic chemistry and the emergence of life on
Earth. Thus, understanding the sources, inventories, and geologic
settings that were most likely involved in Earth's prebiotic chemistry
is fundamental for exploring the origin of terrestrial life. Areas of
particular interest are (1) the significance of and the evidence for
various sources of prebiotic compounds on the early Earth, including
endogenous origins (e.g., hydrothermal vent systems, shallow marine
environments, and atmospheric reactions) and exogenous sources (e.g.,
meteoritic and cometary delivery), and (2) the reaction mechanisms
involved in the synthesis, stability and/or reactivity of prebiotic
compounds within these early Earth environments. This session will
focus on the synthesis and distribution of monomers and "building
blocks" including amino acids, lipids, nucleotides, and other organics
that can potentially lead to the formation of complex molecules.

ABSCICON 2022 SESSION: INTERSTELLAR SMALL BODIES AND EXOCOMETS AND THE
DISTRIBUTION OF ICES AND ORGANICS

Abstract Submission deadline January 19, 2022.

https://agu.confex.com/agu/abscicon21/prelim.cgi/Session/112074

Comet nuclei contain clues about the abundance of the ices and organics
that were present in the era of planet formation, can deliver volatiles
to planets, and may have played a role in the distribution of water in
our Solar System. Recently, the first unambiguous interstellar comet
(2I/Borisov) was discovered passing through our Solar System. Its
highly eccentric orbit provided unambiguous evidence that it was an
interloper from another system. Enabling the interstellar distribution
of materials, the discovery of 2I/Borisov has major astrobiological
consequences and provides a glimpse into the formation and evolution of
another star system. At the same time, growing evidence for exocomets
orbiting other stars has opened up the possibility to study the
dynamics, origin, and compositions of comets across planetary systems.
In this session, we will combine studies of Solar System comets,
interstellar comets, exocomets, and disks to encourage
interdisciplinary understanding and collaboration.

ABSCICON 2022 SESSION: TAPHONOMIC WINDOWS IN PLANETARY ENVIRONMENTS

We invite abstracts investigating the potential for biosignature
preservation within environments relevant to planetary exploration. 

https://agu.confex.com/agu/abscicon21/prelim.cgi/Session/112257

Taphonomy is the study of the processes that enable the preservation of
traces of life from organismal death to mineral capture, retention, and
modification over geologic timescales. As we explore the Solar System
for traces of life, and in particular, evidence of past microbial life,
it is necessary to identify the environments and conditions amenable to
biosignature preservation (i.e., "taphonomic windows") to aid in
prioritizing measurements and sample collection. It is also imperative
to recognize the modifications that an organism and its byproducts
undergo during fossilization to more accurately interpret fossil
remains and establish their biogenicity. This session aims to bring
together research exploring taphonomic processes in environments
analogous to those that might be found on astrobiological targets
throughout the Solar System, and to highlight the varieties of fossil
biosignatures preserved, the environmental conditions in which they
occur, and their accurate interpretation.

ABSCICON 2022 SESSION: PREBIOTIC/ABIOTIC CHEMISTRY IN ALTERNATIVE 
SOLVENTS

Please consider applying to our session on prebiotic/abiotic chemistry
in alternative solvents or solvents with very low water activity.

https://agu.confex.com/agu/abscicon21/prelim.cgi/Session/111829

While much of prebiotic chemistry is focused on reactions systems in
water, as that is the primary solvent on Earth, other solvent systems
may be possible and some have been argued to be potentially more
conducive to origin of life (e.g. formamide). Examples where other
solvents are available on a sufficient scale include Titan, exoplanets,
and locations with low water activity. This session invites abstracts
to showcase the current state of knowledge in this area, including
laboratory and modelling studies on the potential for abiotic chemistry
under these conditions that may represent the first steps towards
biological processes.

Abstract Deadline: January 19, 2022 at 23:59 EDT/03:59 +1 GMT.

ABSCICON 2022 SESSION: CHEMOMETRIC, CHEMOINFORMATIC, AND MACHINE
LEARNING STRATEGIES TO CHARACTERIZE COMPLEX ORGANIC AND INORGANIC
MIXTURES

https://agu.confex.com/agu/abscicon21/prelim.cgi/Session/112057

Astrobiological studies of complex samples often target specific
analytes such as compounds used in contemporary biochemistry. As a
result, the majority of other analytes (which often constitute the
majority of the sample) remain unstudied. Thus, deep understanding of
the extent to which abiotic processes and geochemical conditions drive
(geo)chemical complexity is not fully realized. Such understanding may
be critical for work aimed at deciphering geologic history, elucidating
conditions conducive for abiogenesis, and detecting biosignatures. This
session will highlight chemometric techniques used to characterize
complex organic and/or inorganic mixtures such as those generated from
laboratory simulations (e.g., Miller-Urey reactions,
tholins/astrophysical ice analogs) or within (astro-)geological
materials, including meteorites, Archean rocks, and planetary samples.
Examples of relevant topics include investigations incorporating
multivariate techniques and machine learning tools (including
supervised, unsupervised, and deep learning-based approaches). Work
aimed towards generating databases useful to the
chemometrics/astrobiology community are also welcomed.

Abstract Deadline: January 19, 2022 at 23:59 EDT/03:59 +1 GMT.

ABSCICON 2022 SESSION: ORIGINS OF BIOLOGIC HOMOCHIRALITY

https://agu.confex.com/agu/abscicon21/prelim.cgi/Session/112138

The origin of homochirality is a central unresolved issue in the origin
of life. We invite papers on the topic of homochirality in all of its
manifestations, and via all methods of inquiry including laboratory
experiments, sample analytical measurements, astronomical observations,
and theory and modeling. A non-exhaustive list of topics includes: (1)
spectropolarimetry observations of circularly polarized light in star
formation regions; (2) observations of chiral molecules and circularly
polarized light in space; (3) measurement of enantiomeric excess in
chiral molecules extracted from meteorites; (4) photoelectron circular
dichroism (PECD); (5) spontaneous emergence of homochiral chemical
systems in early Earth environments; (6) chiral-selective adsorption or
catalysis; (7) magneto-chiral processes; (8) the role of spin-polarized
electrons in electron transport; (9) formation and emergence of chiral
structures that transport spin-polarized electrons; (10) the influence
of the chirality-induced spin selectivity (CISS) effect on
spin-selective chemistry and chiral discrimination.

ABSCICON 2022 SESSION: INITIATIVES WITHIN AND RESOURCES FOR THE EARLY
CAREER ASTROBIOLOGY COMMUNITY

https://agu.confex.com/agu/abscicon21/prelim.cgi/Session/112409

Early career networking, collaboration, and exposure to diversity are
critical to developing the next generation of Astrobiologists and
Leaders. Early career astrobiologists around the world have developed
initiatives to build and maintain networks, advance the science of
astrobiology, and diversify the astrobiology community. This session
seeks to highlight these initiatives, advertise collaboration
opportunities, and share resources available to early career
researchers and those involved with training the next generation of
astrobiologists. We invite abstracts from individuals and groups
describing initiatives designed for or by early career astrobiologists
and/or non-traditional pathways towards an astrobiology career. The
organizers particularly seek abstracts that will promote interactive
discussion, increase networking and knowledge sharing, showcase the
interdisciplinary and intergenerational nature of astrobiology, and
further the development of an individually and professionally diverse
astrobiology community. Non-traditional (e.g. activity-based)
presentations are encouraged.
