[NASA] PDS: MARS ATMOSPHERE AND VOLATILE EVOLUTION DATA RELEASE 30

The Planetary Data System (PDS) is pleased to announce the release of
the following data from MAVEN (Mars Atmosphere and Volatile Evolution)
Release 30, nominally with data to May 2022:

- ANC (ancillary)
- EUV (Extreme Ultraviolet Monitor)
- IUVS (Imaging Ultraviolet Spectrograph)
- KP (Insitu Key Parameters)
- LPW (Langmuir Probe and Waves)
- MAG (Magnetometer)
- NGIMS (Neutral Gas and Ion Mass Spectrometer)
- ROSE (Radio Occultation Science Experiment)
- SEP (Solar Energetic Particle)

[NASA] ROSES-22 AMENDMENT 44: DUE DATE DELAYS FOR A.19 ASIA-AQ, B.21 
H-CSI, C.7 NFDAP, AND C.11 DDAP

An NSPIRES bug prevented submission of Notices if Intent (NOIs) and 
Step-1 proposals to certain programs from 8/13/-8/18. Accordingly, NOI 
and Step-1 proposal due dates for four ROSES program elements have 
been delayed by six days.

NOIs for A.19 Airborne and Satellite Investigation of Asian Air 
Quality (ASIA-AQ) are now due September 7, 2022.

Step-1 proposals for B.21 Heliophysics Citizen Science Investigations 
(HCSI) are now due August 24, 2022.

Step-1 proposals for C.7 New Frontiers Data Analysis Program (NFDAP) 
are now due September 7, 2022.

Mandatory NOIs for C.11 Discovery Data Analysis (DDAP) are now due 
September 6, 2022.

This Amendment to ROSES 2022 (NNH22ZDA001N) will be posted on the NASA 
research opportunity homepage here:

https://solicitation.nasaprs.com/ROSES2022

It will appear on SARA's ROSES blog at:

https://science.nasa.gov/researchers/sara/grant-solicitations/roses-2022/

Direct questions concerning A.19 ASIA-AQ to barry.lefer@nasa.gov.

Direct questions concerning B.21 HCSI to susanna.c.finn@nasa.gov.

Direct questions concerning C.7 NFDAP to HQ-NFDAP@mail.nasa.gov.

2023A NASA KECK CALL FOR PROPOSALS

The NASA Exoplanet Science Institute is soliciting proposals to use 
NASA's portion of time on the Keck Telescopes for the 2023A observing 
semester (February 1-July 31, 2023). All proposals are due by 
September 15, 2022 at 4 pm Pacific.

Proposals are sought to support science goals and missions in the 
following discipline areas: 

- Our Own Solar System
- Exoplanet Exploration
- Physics of the Cosmos
- Cosmic Origins

Mission Support Proposals in any of these areas are also encouraged

Please read the Call for Proposals for complete information, semester 
highlights, instrument availability, and application guidelines:

https://nexsci.caltech.edu/missions/KeckSolicitation/gen-info.shtml

The opportunity to propose as a Principal Investigator for NASA time 
on the Keck Telescopes is open to all U.S.-based astronomers (i.e. who 
have their principal affiliation at a U.S. institution). Investigators 
from institutions outside of the U.S. may participate as 
Co-Investigators.

Advance Notice of Joint JWST/Keck Programs: The James Webb Space 
Telescope (JWST) Cycle 2 Call for Proposals will include the 
opportunity to propose for joint programs requiring JWST and NASA Keck 
observations. This does not affect this 2023A NASA Keck Call for 
Proposals. Go here for more information:

POSTDOCTORAL POSITION IN SPACE PHYSICS AT SWEDISH INSTITUTE OF SPACE 
PHYSICS

The Swedish Institute of Space Physics (IRF) in Uppsala is looking for 
a postdoc for the investigations of kinetic plasma processes at Earth's
magnetopause and magnetotail. The work involves the analysis of
magnetic, electric, and plasma measurements from the multi-spacecraft
Magnetospheric Multiscale (MMS) mission.

be accessed online at:

https://www.lpi.usra.edu/mexag/newsletter/

This newsletter shares Mercury science and exploration news,
spotlights early-career researchers, notes upcoming meetings, and
highlights recent publications.

Please send your Mercury community announcements and calendar items
for inclusion in the newsletter to the MExAG Steering Committee at

HIRISE DIGITAL TERRAIN MODELS BY-REQUEST AND AT NO-COST FOR FUNDED 
MARS DATA ANALYSIS PROGRAM AWARDS

To support the needs of the Mars science community, the USGS 
Astrogeology Science Center is providing HiRISE DTMs by request and at 
no charge for funded ROSES 2022 Mars Data Analysis Program proposals. 
Investigators are responsible for identification and selection of 
appropriate HiRISE stereopairs, and must coordinate with USGS 
personnel before proposal submission to obtain a Confirmation of 
Technical Specification Letter. DTMs will only be generated for funded 
proposals. Technical requirements can be found at the USGS 
Astrogeology Planetary Photogrammetry site: 

https://tinyurl.com/USGS-HiRISE-DTM

Additional details are available in Section 4.3.7 of Appendix C of 
NASA ROSES 2022.

INVITATION TO CONTRIBUTE TO PSJ SPECIAL ISSUE: TOWARDS IN SITU 
OBSERVATIONS OF PLANETARY SURFACE-ATMOSPHERE INTERACTIONS

We invite the community to submit papers to a Planetary Science 
Journal special issue, "Towards in situ observations of planetary 
surface-atmosphere interactions". The goal of this issue is to 
showcase recent research into surface-atmosphere interactions that can 
be constrained by in situ observations of present-day processes and 
their environmental drivers.

Papers that focus on fundamental physical processes or activity on a 
specific planetary body (including Earth) are welcome, as long as the 
work relates to processes or investigations relevant to planetary 
science studies. Mission or instrument or operations concept papers 
are also welcome, as long as they are tied to key science questions.

Papers can be submitted through November, 2022; the issue is targeted 
for March, 2023. Please direct questions about this special issue to 
Serina Diniega (serina.diniega@jpl.nasa.gov). The other guest editors 
are Lou Giersch (JPL), Jack Gillies (DRI), Brian Jackson (BSU), 
Alejandro Soto (SwRI), and Tim Titus (USGS). Submission instructions 
and page charges are explained here:

https://journals.aas.org/planetary-science-journal/

Fee waivers for those with need can be requested through PSJ, please 
email Serina for more information.

POSTDOC AT JPL: COMETARY COMAE

The postdoc will be involved in an effort to accurately retrieve the 
abundance and distribution of water in the coma of Comet 
67P/Churyumov-Gerasamenko to help understand the physical processes 
driving outbursts and coma formation and evolution. The postdoc will 
play a central role in modeling how small dust grains can radiatively 
"pump" gases in the coma to higher temperatures than expected from 
considerations of local thermal equilibrium, incorporating that model 
into an existing coma simulation, and then using that code to retrieve 
physical properties of the coma.  

Qualifications:

Candidate must have:
- Ph.D. in planetary science or a related field
- Experience with observational or theoretical studies of comae
- Familiarity with spectral observations

Desired qualifications include:
- Experience with radio- or IR-wavelength observations
- Familiarity with radiative transfer calculations and numerical 
  modeling
- Familiarity with systems in non-local thermodynamic equilibrium

A complete description and instructions to apply are available at

https://www.jpl.jobs/job/R2557/Postdoc-Study-of-Cometary-Comae-Rosetta-Mission

Prospective candidates are encouraged to contact Dr. Hofstadter 
(mark.hofstadter@jpl.nasa.gov) or Dr. von Allmen 
(paul.vonallmen@jpl.nasa.gov) prior to submitting their application to 
discuss their research interests.

This position is available immediately, and applications will be 
reviewed as they are received.
