NAIF RELEASES NEW WEBGEOCALC VERSION 2.5.4

NAIF announces the deployment of the new WebGeocalc (WGC) version 
2.5.4 on both NAIF's WGC servers:

https://wgc.jpl.nasa.gov:8443/ (GUI only)

https://wgc2.jpl.nasa.gov:8443/ (GUI and Web API)

This new version adds a new Pointing Direction calculation both in WGC 
GUI and in the WGC Web API. This calculation computes the pointing 
direction of a user specified vector - position, velocity, instrument 
boresight, instrument FOV boundary vector, reference frame axis, or an 
arbitrary vector - in a user specified reference frame and outputs it 
as a unit or full magnitude vector represented in a user specified 
coordinate system.

MARS RECONNAISSANCE ORBITER: SIXTEEN YEARS OBSERVING A CHANGING MARS

For 16 years, the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO) has used its three 
cameras, multi-spectral imaging spectrometer, shallow radar, and 
atmospheric sounder to observe the surface, subsurface and atmosphere 
of Mars at unprecedented spatial resolution and with expanded coverage 
in space and time. Although designed to "follow the water" of an 
ancient Mars climate, the very high spatial resolution imaging and 
growing timeline of observations has enabled MRO to reveal 
unprecedented changes occurring on the planet today (e.g., recurring 
slope lineae; annual patterns of regional dust storms). This special 
issue gives an overview of the evolving capabilities of MRO and its 
investigations, its key findings and evolving strategies. It will also 
include papers on the latest findings, together with plans for the 
ongoing exploration of Mars by MRO.

Submission deadline: March 1, 2023

WORKSHOP: QUANTUM SENSORS FOR SCIENCE EXPLORATION

We are pleased to announce a workshop on quantum sensors for science 
exploration that will take place on 25-26 May 2023. at the European 
Space Technology Centre (ESTEC) in Noordwijk, The Netherlands.

Quantum sensors are based on technologies whose performance is not 
limited by the boundaries of classical physics. Such instruments allow 
for ultrasensitive measurements in the area of gravity, accelerations, 
electric and magnetic fields, and communications. A major advantage of 
such sensor types is the lack of drifts and need for calibration. The 
objective of the workshop is to gather different communities to 
exchange on how quantum sensors can help advance Solar System science 
in the future, with various quantum sensing techniques.
