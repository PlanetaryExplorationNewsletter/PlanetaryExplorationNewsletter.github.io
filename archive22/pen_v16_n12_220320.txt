SCIENCE OBJECTIVES FOR HUMAN EXPLORATION OF MARS WORKSHOP

Denver, CO 
May 4-6, 2022

A human mission to Mars will be a landmark achievement and a golden 
opportunity to conduct groundbreaking science on Mars. This workshop 
will identify the highest priority science objectives for a human 
mission to Mars, identify appropriate mission scenarios that best 
enable the science objectives, and define high-level concepts of 
operation, including equipment and instrumentation, needed to achieve 
the science objectives.

The workshop will immediately follow the May MEPAG meeting in Denver 
and is intended to be an in-person working workshop. Attendance and 
participation are not contingent on abstract submission, and 
registration is free.

For more information and to register, please visit the workshop

one planetary target to inform our understanding of another - the realm 
of comparative planetology - are especially encouraged, as are those 
that leverage Earth analogs.

Letter-length, long-form, and review articles are all appropriate. 
Examples of themes include but are not limited to geomorphology, 
geologic surface processes, tectonics, exploration, aeolian studies, 
geologic mapping, chronostratigraphy, and spectroscopy.

The normal fee for Open Access publication is 2500 CHF (Swiss Francs; 
roughly $2700 USD, 2000 GBP, $3500 CAN; 2500 EUR). However, the 
publication fee will be waived or discounted by 30-50% for certain 
articles deemed especially high-impact.

Please let us know if you have questions.

POSTDOC POSITION IN LABORATORY STUDIES OF RADIATION-INDUCED PROCESSES

The Ice Spectroscopy Laboratory at NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory in 
Pasadena, CA invites applications for a new postdoctoral opportunity 
in radiation-induced processes. The research work will involve 
laboratory simulations of interactions between Solar System bodies and 
energetic particles such as electrons, protons, and heavy ions 
(O+, S+). The work will primarily focus on interactions between 
energetic electrons and the surface of Europa at temperatures of 
~100 K, including sputtering, electron penetration, and the effects of 
ionizing radiation on organic molecules and microbial life. Expertise 
in physics and chemistry of radiation and a strong interest to conduct 
research in these areas is highly desired.

[NASA] ROSES-22: ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND POLICY ANALYSES OF ORBITAL 
DEBRIS AND SPACE SUSTAINABILITY

Analyzing the economic, social, and political impacts of orbital debris 
is a nascent field of study that would greatly benefit from more 
research. To this end, NASA will work with selected teams and experts 
from non-governmental organizations to evaluate to evaluate the 
economic, social, and political elements of orbital debris and space 
sustainability, a strategic NASA and/or United States Government 
approach to orbital debris and international space sustainability 
efforts. The new program element F17 Economic, Social, and Policy 
Analyses of Orbital Debris and Space Sustainability addresses this. 

No Notice of Intent nor Step-1 proposal is requested. Proposals are due 
June 17, 2022. Go to:

PLANETARY WORKSHOP TO ENGAGE DIVERSE AUDIENCES

April 6-9, 2022
Tempe, AZ

Planetary scientists are invited to attend the Planetary ReaCH workshop 
and learn how to engage diverse audiences in planetary science.

https://www.lpi.usra.edu/planetary-reach

Workshop Goal: To prepare planetary scientists and informal educators 
to engage audiences in planetary science and exploration, with an 
explicit focus on Latinx and Black communities.

During the workshop, planetary scientists and informal educators will 
come together to:

- Collaborate / learn from each other, sharing their expertise in 
  planetary science and engaging audiences.
- Modify hands-on planetary activities and resources to better engage 
  audiences.
- Learn and share effective practices and strategies to engage Black 
  and Latinx communities.
- Practice conducting activities using these strategies at a community 
  event on Saturday, April 9.

Times and location: The workshop will take place in meeting rooms on 
the Arizona State University Tempe campus for the first three days, 
with a community engagement event in Phoenix on April 9.

Travel Stipends available for participating scientists.

Who: Space is limited to 15 planetary scientists (including graduate 
students, post-doctoral researchers, and planetary engineers and 
technicians) and 15 informal educators.

2022 NASA PLANETARY SCIENCE SUMMER SCHOOL APPLICATIONS DUE MARCH 30

Offered by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, CA, PSSS is a 
3-month long career development experience to learn the development of 
a hypothesis-driven robotic space mission in a concurrent engineering 
environment while getting an in-depth, first-hand look at mission 
design, life cycle, costs, schedule and the inherent trade-offs.

Science and engineering doctoral candidates, recent PhDs, postdocs, and 
junior faculty who are U.S. Citizens or legal permanent residents (and 
a very limited number of Foreign Nationals from non-designated 
counties) are eligible. Applicants from diverse backgrounds are 
particularly encouraged to apply - we highly value diversity, equity, 
and inclusion.

Session 1: May 9-Aug 5
Session 2: May 23-Aug 19
 
With workload of a rigorous 3-hour graduate-level course, participants 
act as a planetary science mission team during the first 12 weeks of 
preparatory webinars, with the final culminating week mentored by 
JPL's Advance Project Design Team for refining the mission concept 
design and presenting it to a mock expert review board. The 
culminating week is typically at JPL, but in 2022 it is likely virtual 
due to Covid-19 pandemic concerns.
