ABSCICON 2022 SESSION: SIGNATURES OF ASTROSPHERIC SPACE WEATHER FROM 
PLANET HOSTS AND ITS IMPACT ON EXOPLANETS 

Abstract Submission deadline January 19, 2022.

https://agu.confex.com/agu/abscicon21/prelim.cgi/Session/142429

Recent discoveries of rocky exoplanets in the habitable zones around M 
dwarfs and magnetically active young solar-type stars suggest that 
many exoplanets should be subject to the high fluxes from ionizing 
radiations via astrospheric space weather. This includes coronal X-ray 
and extreme-ultraviolet emission, stellar winds and eruptive events in 
the form of stellar flares and associated coronal mass ejections 
(CMEs) and stellar energetic particles (StEP) events. These stellar 
emissions are the critical inputs for calculations of atmospheric 
escape, chemistry, climates of rocky exoplanets around active stars, 
which ultimately may determine exoplanetary habitability. The proposed 
session invites theoretical and observational studies that provide 
insights on the physical processes of active G, K and M planet host 
(including young solar analogs) chromospheres, coronae and winds, 
stellar (super)flares, CMEs and SEP events; as well as new 
observational approaches to studying their impact on exoplanets.

JOB ANNOUNCEMENT FOR CANADA RESEARCH CHAIR (TIER-2) AT YORK UNIVERSITY

The Lassonde School of Engineering at York University invites highly 
qualified candidates to apply for a Canada Research Chair (Tier-2) in 
Science or Engineering specializing in any field that is a current or 
developing area of strength for the Faculty. Notably, LSE is home to 
the Centre for Research in Earth and Space Science (CRESS).

The Canada Research Chairs program seeks to attract outstanding 
researchers for careers at Canadian universities. Tier 2 Chairs are 
intended for exceptional emerging scholars (i.e., who, at the time of 
nomination, are within 10 years of attaining their highest degree, 
with consideration for career breaks) who have the acknowledged 
potential to lead their field of research.

LSE is committed to providing a welcoming and supportive environment 
for all who wish to study, teach, and conduct research. For this 
search, only candidates who self-identify as a member of one or more 
of the following underrepresented groups may apply: women, Aboriginal 
(Indigenous), Black peoples of African Descent (for example Africans 
and African heritage people from the Caribbean, Americas, Europe) and 
persons with disabilities.

Application deadline is January 31, 2022.

#LOWCOSTMARS2022 CONFERENCE RESCHEDULED TO MARCH 29-31, 2022

As a consequence of the recent and significant rise in COVID-19 cases, 
the organizing committee for the Low-Cost Science Mission Concepts for 
Mars Exploration conference has decided to postpone the meeting. The 
conference, originally planned for January 11-13, 2022, is now 
scheduled for March 29-31, 2022 and will be held at the same venue, 
the Westin Pasadena Hotel, in Pasadena, CA.

Further detailed information on the re-scheduled meeting will be 
posted in the coming days in e-mail correspondence to all who were 
registered for the January meeting and/or had expressed an "indication 
of interest" on the conference website, as well as on the conference 
website:

https://www.hou.usra.edu/meetings/lowcostmars2022/

We hope that all who were planning to participate in the January event 
will be able to take part in the re-scheduled event on March 29-31, 
2022. If you booked a room through the Westin-Pasadena block of rooms, 
those rooms will be cancelled and a new link will be sent out at a 
later date.

Sincerely,

Shannon Curry & Chad Edwards
Co-Chairs, #LowCostMars2022

PLANETARY GEOMORPHOLOGY IMAGE OF THE MONTH

The January image of the month is now available at the IAG's Planetary 
Geomorphology web page:

This month's topic is "Thermal-contraction polygons on Earth and 
Mars", contributed by Meven Philippe, Ph.D student, Laboratoire de 
Planetologie et Geodynamique de Nantes, CNRS/Universite de Nantes, 
France.
