[NASA] F.13 LUNAR TERRAIN VEHICLE INSTRUMENTS PROGRAM DEFERRED TO
ROSES-2023

When it is solicited in ROSES-2023, Lunar Terrain Vehicle Instruments
Program (F.13 LTV) will seek proposals for instruments to be deployed
on the Lunar Terrain Vehicle that will be delivered to the lunar
surface ahead of the second crewed Artemis lunar surface mission.

ROSES-2022 Amendment 62 announces that Lunar Terrain Vehicle
Instruments Program (F.13 LTV) which had been listed as "TBD" will not
be solicited in ROSES-2022. Instead, it will be solicited in
ROSES-2023, to be released in February 2023.

This Amendment to the NASA Research Announcement "Research
Opportunities in Space and Earth Sciences (ROSES) 2022" (NNH22ZDA001N)
will be posted on the NASA research opportunity homepage at:

https://solicitation.nasaprs.com/ROSES2022

and will appear on SARA's ROSES blog at:

https://science.nasa.gov/researchers/sara/grant-solicitations/roses-2022/

Questions regarding  F.13 LTV may be directed to Debra Needham at
debra.m.hurwitz@nasa.gov and Brad Bailey at brad.bailey@nasa.gov.

This Amendment will be posted on the NASA research opportunity 
homepage at:

[NASA] F.11 STAND ALONE LOCATION AGNOSTIC PAYLOADS AND RESEARCH
INVESTIGATIONS ON THE SURFACE OF THE MOON DEFERRED TO ROSES-2023

F.11 Stand Alone Location Agnostic Payloads and Research Investigations
on the Surface of the Moon (SALA PRISM) was to have solicited proposals
for stand-alone science investigations that include development and
flight of location agnostic science-driven payloads to be delivered to
the lunar surface by the Commercial Lunar Payload Services.

ROSES-2022 Amendment 63 announces that F.11 SALA PRISM, which had
previously been listed as "TBD" will not be solicited in ROSES-2022.
Instead, it will be solicited in ROSES-2023, to be released in February
2023.

This Amendment to the NASA Research Announcement "Research

2023 PIERAZZO INTERNATIONAL STUDENT TRAVEL AWARD

Application deadline: 9 PM MST, November 28, 2022

Awards will be announced on or before December 4, 2022.

This award is established by the Planetary Science Institute in memory
of Senior Scientist Betty Pierazzo to support and encourage graduate
students to build international collaborations and relationships in
planetary science. Two awards will be made each year, contingent upon
there being meritorious applications. One will be awarded to a graduate
student working on his or her Ph.D. at an institution within the U.S.
This is to support travel to a planetary science related meeting
(conferences and workshops) outside of the U.S. The second award will
be to a graduate student working on his or her Ph.D. at an institution
outside of the U.S. This is to support travel to a planetary science
related meeting within the U.S. These include general meetings that
have planetary-focused sessions such as the AGU, GSA, EGU and IAG.

The award will consist of a certificate and up to $2000US.

Additional information and application materials are available at:

EUROPA OBSERVERS GROUP

The Europa Clipper Project is bringing together a group of ground and
space-based observers of Europa, with the goal of enhancing the
scientific return of the Europa Clipper mission. The purpose of the
group is to provide temporal coverage and context for measurements,
additional wavelengths and geometries, monitoring, follow-up, and
advocacy to TACs. The Europa Clipper Project will host a workshop once
or twice a year in conjunction with a major conference, with the first
one tentatively set for DPS 2023. Observers are expected to fund their
own activities. If you are interested in being on the mailing list,
please contact Bonnie Buratti, Europa Clipper JPL Deputy Project
Scientist, (bonnie.buratti@jpl.nasa.gov), with a one sentence summary
describing your expected contribution.

INCLUSION PLAN BEST PRACTICES WORKSHOP

NASA's Science Mission Directorate (SMD) is happy to announce the first
virtual Inclusion Plan Best Practices Workshop, scheduled for November
1-2, 2022, 1:00-3:00 p.m. Eastern Time each day. For more information
see:

https://www.hou.usra.edu/meetings/inclusionplan2022/

The workshop will be recorded and posted on the SARA website.

Many programs within NASA's Research Opportunities in Space and Earth
Sciences (ROSES) are now requiring that proposals contain an inclusion
plan that outlines how the team will work against barriers to create
and sustain inclusive work environments. SMD is hosting an Inclusion
Plan Best Practices Workshop to provide proposers with some background
and tools needed to be active participants in creating and maintaining
inclusive work environments. 

This workshop is open to any member of the science community and may be
of particular interest to those writing ROSES or mission proposals
requiring inclusion plans. Questions may be directed to
ryan.n.watkins@nasa.gov

GALILEAN MOONS WORKSHOP

The Workshop on the Origins and Habitability of the Galilean Moons is
scheduled for October 24-26, 2023, at the Laboratoire d'Astrophysique
de Marseille, Technopole de Marseille-Etoile, France. The three-day 
in-person workshop will be co-chaired by Olivier Mousis, Kathy Mandt 
and Morgan Cable. Further information can be found here:  

https://galileanmoons.com  

The goal of this workshop is to prepare for the arrival of the
ESA/JUICE and NASA/Europa-Clipper missions in the Jovian system. In
particular, the link between the composition of the moons and the
formation conditions of giant planets systems, as well as their
potential habitability, as evidenced by measurement techniques,
instrumentation, laboratory experiments, and future mission concepts in
the framework of international collaborations, are of high interest.
Presenters will be encouraged to submit their works to a special issue
of a dedicated journal. 

In-person attendance will be limited to ninety people; limited
opportunity for virtual participation is planned. Some support for
in-person attendance may also be available for students and
early-career researchers. The organizers will monitor the COVID
situation, and the workshop format, including virtual participation,
will be adjusted as necessary.

2023 TECHNOLOGY SHOWCASE FOR FUTURE NASA PLANETARY SCIENCE MISSIONS

On January 9-11, 2023, NASA^s Science Mission Directorate is sponsoring
a Technology Showcase - focused this year on planetary science - to
foster discussions about new technologies that may substantially
improve future missions the science community has identified. The
Showcase will take place in Galveston, TX.

Abstracts describing future missions (from SIMPLEx to New Frontiers
scope) are still being accepted and will be posted on the event 
website.

Abstracts are two pages and should cover mission basics (Overview,
Operations, Instruments, Science Objectives, needed technologies with
current TRL, etc.)

MEPAG community abstracts should be submitted to Jonathan Bapst via
email at jonathan.bapst@jpl.nasa.gov

Scientists, mission managers, and other interested parties are invited
to attend. Registration information, science mission abstracts, and
additional information will be posted at:

https:// NASA-techshowcase.seti.org

professor level. More senior appointments may be considered in special
cases, commensurate with experience.

A complete application includes (1) a cover letter, (2) Curriculum
Vitae, (3) a 1-3 page summary of current and future research
directions, (4) a 1-3 page statement describing teaching and mentoring
experience and/or future plans, including contributions to fostering
diversity, equity, and inclusion, and (5) three letters of
