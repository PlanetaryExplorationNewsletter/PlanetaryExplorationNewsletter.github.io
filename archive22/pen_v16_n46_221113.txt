be affiliated with the appropriate academic department at CU.

Areas of interest include: Research approaches from remote sensing, to 
instrument development, to space missions, to laboratory studies and 
to theory, addressing research targets both within our Solar System 
and exoplanets, and applying fields such as atmospheric science, 
planetary geology, astrobiology, geophysics, space environments, 
dynamics, etc.

The University of Colorado Boulder is committed to building a 
culturally diverse community of faculty, staff, and students dedicated 
to contributing to an inclusive campus environment. We are an Equal 
Opportunity employer, including veterans and individuals with

observations will be coordinated with space missions such as JAXA's 
Akatsuki, ESA-JAXA's BepiColombo, and ESA's EnVision. Experience with 
analysis of telescope or spacecraft data like images or spectra is 
desired, and good knowledge of radiative transfer models is preferred. 
The successful applicants will have opportunities to mentor internship 
students in PAG. Collaboration with national and international teams 
will be strongly supported.

Total four positions are available: Two Senior Researcher position and

LAST CALL: PLANETARY SCIENCE MENTAL HEALTH SURVEY

For those who have not yet filled out the survey. Just a gentle 
reminder about the survey, the survey will be closed on Nov. 20:

We would like to invite those associated with the planetary science 
field to participate in our mental health survey of the planetary 
science community. Mental health is an important issue to the general 
population and even in the science community. With this awareness, we 
are surveying our planetary science community to have a better 
understanding of how it is doing.

If you decide to participate, please follow the link below. The survey 
takes about 10-15 minutes and the information generated will be 
anonymous. We appreciate you giving us your valuable time to be 
involved in this important matter. If possible, we ask that you send 
this survey to people within your institution, department, and 
colleagues who are also a part of the planetary science community so 
that we can ensure that everyone is included and heard.

VENERA-D: VENUS CLOUD HABITABILITY SYSTEM WORKSHOP FINAL REPORT

The Venera-D Workshop Final Report is available for download here:

https://tinyurl.com/2dkd2k7c

The goals of this workshop were to discuss the formation and stability 
of Venus clouds over time, past and present habitability, the best 
measurements and methods needed to address these questions, and how 
future missions will contribute to understanding the cloud 
habitability system.

The major action items were:

1) further development of in-situ instrumentation for exploration of 
   the Venusian clouds
2) advancement of models and experimental labs to investigate the 
   development and survivability of life in simulated Venus 
   environments
3) communication between Venus researchers from different fields of 
   science and different agencies to maximize science advancement.
