MARS EXPLORATION SCIENCE MONTHLY NEWSLETTER FOR AUGUST 2019

To the Mars Community,

On behalf of Aileen Yingst (MEPAG Chair), Dave Beaty, Rich Zurek, and
Serina Diniega of the Mars Program Science Office, the August 2019
edition of the Mars Exploration Science Monthly Newsletter can be found
on the web at:

http://mepag.jpl.nasa.gov

Please send your Mars community announcements and calendar items for
inclusion in the newsletter to Barbara at:
Barbara.A.Saltzberg@jpl.nasa.gov.

And because of its close deadline, we draw your attention to this
announcement:

Following the recommendations made in the mid-term review of Visions &
Voyages, a Mars Strategic Architecture study group is being set up by
NASA, with Bruce Jakosky (CU Boulder/LASP) as Chair. The scope and
membership of this study group is still in work. The major activity
will take place between now and early next year. Volunteers with broad
interests and time availability for this study should email Michael
Meyer (michael.a.meyer@nasa.gov) by August 14, with the subject line:
Mars Strategy.

POSTDOCTORAL POSITION IN EXPERIMENTAL PLANETARY SCIENCE

Columbia University's Astrophysics Laboratory seeks a Postdoctoral
Scientist to perform laboratory simulations of solar wind ion
irradiation of Mercury's regolith surface. The postdoc will
participate in designing, building, and performing experiments
utilizing a novel ion-beam apparatus.  

The candidate will have a Ph.D. or equivalent in Planetary Science,
Physics, Astrophysics, or a related field. Desired laboratory skills
include apparatus design and construction; fast ion beams; ion optics;
ultra-high vacuum techniques; ultraviolet, visible, and near infrared
spectral reflectance measurements; quadrupole mass spectrometers;
catcher foils; X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy; and associated
electronics. Desired computer skills include programming,
multidimensional data analysis, LabView, Python, Autodesk Inventor,
Solidworks, SIMION, Linux/Mac OS, and Windows OS. 

The candidate will also have a proven research ability, evidence of
future research potential, the ability to work well independently and
cooperatively with a team, and strong oral and written communication
skills. 
 
Applicants should submit a cover letter, curriculum vitae, list of
publications, and statement of past research, and have three letters of
reference sent directly by the writers to the group leader Dr. Daniel
Wolf Savin. All materials should be submitted by email to
savin@astro.columbia.edu. Screening will begin immediately and
continue until the position is filled.

JAY PASACHOFF WINS THE 2019 KLUMPKE-ROBERTS AWARD OF THE ASP

Given for a lifetime of outstanding contributions to the public
understanding and appreciation of astronomy, the Klumpke-Roberts Award
of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific for 2019 goes to Jay
Pasachoff, Field Memorial Professor of Astronomy, Williams College, for
his lifelong endeavor as a popular and scholarly communicator.
Previous winners of this prize include Carl Sagan, Isaac Asimov, Dava
Sobel and Ed Krupp.

Jay Pasachoff's passion for popularizing astronomy goes beyond his role
as professor and researcher. He has written many books for students and
the public, including the popular Field Guide to the Stars and Planets,
now in the 17th printing of its 4th edition; the textbook The Cosmos:
Astronomy in the New Millennium, now in its 5th edition; and Cosmos:
The Art and Science of the Universe, a new book on the intersection of
art and astronomy. He is perhaps best known for his research and
writing on solar eclipses, a phenomenon for which he is arguably the
greatest living proselytizer, having now seen and explained 35 total
eclipses. His expeditions have led to popular articles in National
Geographic, Scientific American, and elsewhere, as well as many media
appearances.

NASA POSTDOCTORAL FELLOWSHIP - APPLICATION DEADLINE NOVEMBER 1, 2019

The NASA Postdoctoral Program offers US and international scientists
the opportunity to advance their research while contributing to NASA's
scientific goals. The NPP supports fundamental science; explores the
undiscovered; promotes intellectual growth; and encourages scientific
connections.

Selected by a competitive peer-review process, NPP Fellows complete
one- to three-year Fellowship appointments that advance NASA's missions
in earth science, heliophysics, planetary science, astrophysics, space
bioscience, aeronautics and engineering, human exploration and space
operations, and astrobiology.

Current NPP research opportunities in planetary science can be viewed
here:

https://npp.usra.edu/opportunities/?filter_keywords=&filter_fields=145

Applicants must have a Ph.D. or equivalent degree in hand before
beginning the fellowship, but may apply while completing the degree
requirements. U.S. citizens, Lawful Permanent Residents, and foreign
nationals eligible for J-1 status as a Research Scholar may apply.

Stipends start at $60,000 per year, with supplements for high
cost-of-living areas and for certain academic specialties.

Applications are accepted three times each year: March 1, July 1, and
November 1. For further information and to apply, visit:

POSTDOCTORAL RESEARCH ASSOCIATE POSITION: AEOLIAN LANDFORMS AND
PROCESSES AT THE ESA EXOMARS ROVER LANDING SITE

A 3-year, full-time, postdoctoral research position is available in the
Planetary Environments Research group at the Open University, UK.
The research project will explore the aeolian environment of the
ExoMars Rosalind Franklin Rover's landing site in Oxia Planum, Mars. We
will use field studies, orbital remote sensing and Rover surface
observations to understand the aeolian environment and erosional
history of the Oxia Planum site, and combine our results with global
and local scale atmospheric models. The role will include participating
in operations of the ExoMars PanCam camera instrument when the Rover
lands in March 2021.
