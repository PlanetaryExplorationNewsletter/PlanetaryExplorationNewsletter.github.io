ASSISTANT PROFESSOR IN PLANETARY SCIENCE, UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,
SEATTLE

The University of Washington seeks an outstanding scientist working at
the forefront of planetary research. The opening is for a tenure-track 
Assistant Professor in the Department of Earth & Space Sciences.

The new faculty member will be specialized in one or more of the
following: geology, geomorphology, geochemistry, glaciology, or
geophysics of planets and interactions with their atmospheres and
oceans. They may focus on observations, experiments, and/or modeling.
We seek a colleague who can contribute collaboratively within the
department, college, and across campus, for example, the university's
Astrobiology Program. Current or potential involvement in planetary
exploration and/or use of remote sensing data is desirable but not
essential.

Candidates should demonstrate the potential to build an internationally
recognized research program that addresses questions of fundamental
significance. Candidates should also show potential for high quality
undergraduate and graduate teaching. Applicants must hold a Ph.D. or
foreign equivalent in Geophysics, Geology, Planetary Sciences, or a
related field at the time of appointment.

For full applications details, please see:

https://apply.interfolio.com/69115

Preference will be given to applications received before December 1,
2019.

CALL FOR IAG GRANTS - 7TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON MARS POLAR
SCIENCE AND EXPLORATION

I'm pleased to announce that the International Association of
Geomorphologists offers 2 grants of 500 euros to favour the
participation of Young Geomorphologists in the 7th International
Conference on Mars Polar Science and Exploration.

The call is available at the following link:

NEW WEB ADDRESS FOR MAP-A-PLANET 2 (MAP2) ONLINE TOOL FOR PDS AT USGS

This is to let you know of a change in the Web address of the
Map-a-Planet 2 (MAP2) online tool for PDS at USGS. The address is:

https://astrogeology.usgs.gov/tools/map-a-planet-2

The older domains for mapaplanet, .org and .net, have been deprecated
and will no longer work. This change was initiated 4 years ago and
users were informed that it was coming since that time - it has finally
happened because of a USGS online data policy. If you pointed to any of
these, you may need to update the MAP2 address.

Recall that MAP2 allows users to select global image mosaics for
download or (with an account) one can request the mosaic be map
projected, clipped to specified spatial extents, run through a variety
of math functions, and/or delivered as a new product in the user's
desired file format. If you have any questions about MAP2 or this
change, please contact Lisa Gaddis at lgaddis@usgs.gov.

TENURE-STREAM POSITION AT MICHIGAN STATE (MSU)

The Department of Physics and Astronomy at Michigan State University
(MSU) invites applications for a tenure-system faculty position in
astronomy. The search is open to all fields of observational,
data-intensive, or survey astronomy. The successful candidate will have
demonstrated the ability to carry out forefront research and a
commitment to building an equitable and diverse scholarly environment.
While we expect the appointment to be at the assistant professor level,
an appointment at the level of associate or full professor will be
considered depending on the experience of the candidate.

MSU has strong astrophysics research programs in compact objects,
nuclear astrophysics, galaxy clusters, large-scale simulations,
statistical and computational techniques, and particle astrophysics.
MSU astronomers enjoy guaranteed access to the 4.1-m SOAR Telescope,
which is co-located on Cerro Pachon with the Large Synoptic Survey
Telescope. MSU is also the lead institution of the NSF's Joint
Institute for Nuclear Astrophysics-Center for the Evolution of the
Elements (JINA-CEE). MSU astronomers run both an astrophysics
undergraduate major and an astronomy and astrophysics Ph.D. program.

LOCKHEED MARTIN RELEASES USER'S GUIDE FOR MCCANDLESS LUNAR LANDER

Lockheed Martin offers transportation services to the surface of the
Moon using its McCandless Lunar Lander, named for Shuttle astronaut and
Apollo 11 CAPCOM Bruce McCandless II. To facilitate payload planning,
the company has publicly released the lander User's Guide, available
online at:

www.lockheedmartin.com/McCandlessLunarLander

The McCandless lander can deliver up to 350 kg of cargo to the lunar
surface, and provide data links and up to 400 W of payload power for
approximately 300 hours on the lunar surface (one lunar day). Lockheed
Martin was selected by NASA for inclusion in the Commercial Lunar
Payload Services (CLPS) program for transporting NASA payloads.
Commercial and international customers can arrange transportation
services directly with Lockheed Martin.
