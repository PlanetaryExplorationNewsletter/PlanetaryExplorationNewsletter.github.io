UPCOMING PROPOSAL WRITING WORKSHOPS

The success of scientists depends upon their ability to obtain funding. 
Using Research Opportunities in Space and Earth Sciences (ROSES) from 
NASA as a primary example, this workshop will focus on teaching the 
audience key points to writing a successful proposal. Proposal Writing 
Workshops help early career scientists, as well as those looking to 
improve their previous proposal performance. As a result of this 
session, participants will be able to understand the proposal writing, 
reviewing, and selection process for federally funded proposals, and 
help those who have previously submitted proposals improve their 
performance. The workshop will be done in a format that allows for a 
great deal of audience participation. Participants are encouraged to 
bring along previous proposal materials and reviews to go through 
within the group or for one-on-one Q&A during the workshop.

There are two upcoming opportunities to participate in a Proposal 
Writing Workshop:

[NASA] ROSES: NEW OPPORTUNITY IN C.30 PLANETARY MISSION CONCEPT STUDIES

NASA has started preparations for the 2023 Planetary Science Decadal 
Survey and one of the tasks of the 2023 Decadal Survey Committee will 
be to recommend a portfolio of planetary science missions. The Decadal 
Survey Committee may choose to recommend a portfolio of missions 
containing a mix of prioritized large- and medium-size mission 
concepts, or even a program of competed medium-size missions. NASA and 
the community are interested in providing appropriate input to the 2023 
Decadal Survey regarding medium/large-size mission concepts. To this 
end, NASA is soliciting proposals to conduct mission concept studies in 
planetary science. Results of the selected studies will be provided by 
NASA as input to the 2023 Decadal Survey.

Mandatory NOIs are due by March 22, 2019, and the due date for 15-page 
proposals is May 21, 2019. Any new information that comes out of or 
questions sent to the NASA point of contact will be posted in a FAQ on 
the NSPIRES web page for this program element.

[NASA] ROSES: NEW OPPORTUNITY IN C.31 KPLO PSP

This amendment creates a new opportunity in program element C.31, the 
Korea Pathfinder Lunar Orbiter Participating Scientist Program.

The objective of the Korea Pathfinder Lunar Orbiter (KPLO) 
Participating Scientist Program (PSP) is to enhance the scientific 
return during the science phase of the KPLO mission by expanding 
participation in the mission through new investigations that 1) broaden 
or complement existing mission investigations, or 2) leverage the KPLO 
mission data for studies outside of the original mission scope. The 
KPLO Participating Scientist Program is jointly solicited by the 
Science Mission Directorate (SMD) Planetary Science Division (PSD) 
and the Human Exploration and Operations Directorate (HEOMD) Advanced 
Exploration Systems (AES) Division, but will be administered primarily 
by the Planetary Science Division.

For C.31, the Korea Pathfinder Lunar Orbiter Participating Scientist 
Program, Step-1 proposals are due April 2, 2019 and proposals are due 
May 22, 2019.

3RD COSPAR WORKING MEETING ON REFINING PLANETARY PROTECTION 
REQUIREMENTS FOR HUMAN MISSIONS TO MARS

COSPAR, with support from ESA and NASA, is pleased to announce the 3rd 
COSPAR Working Meeting on Refining Planetary Protection Requirements 
for Human Missions to Mars, to be held May 14-16, 2019, at the Lunar 
and Planetary Institute in Houston. This is an interdisciplinary 
meeting to continue the process of addressing previously identified 
knowledge gaps in planetary protection between now and the first 
crewed flight to the martian surface.

The meeting will feed into subsequent COSPAR reporting on potential 
opportunities to address knowledge gaps in the areas of: i) Microbial 
and human health monitoring; ii) Technology and operations for 
contamination control; and iii) Natural transport of contamination on 
Mars. The second two days will have a particular focus on measurements 
and instruments for addressing knowledge gaps in Microbial and Human 
Health Monitoring.

Further information on agenda, logistics, registration and remote 
participation will be available shortly.

The workshop seeks to ensure a balance of discipline specialty and 
nationality among the participants. Accordingly, in person attendance 
may be limited by the capacity of the facilities. Indications of 
interest in participation can be sent to Valerie.a.chabot@nasa.gov

SSERVI CARBON IN THE SOLAR SYSTEM LPSC WORKSHOP

The 4th in our series of SSERVI-sponsored Carbon in the Solar System 
workshops will be held on Thursday of LPSC week (March 21), 
noon-1:15 PM in the Indian Springs room at the Marriott. The event 
will focus on the material that darkens low-albedo bodies in the 
Solar System. In the previous three SSERVI Carbon in the Solar System 
workshops/panels, opinions varied on the material that darkens the 
low-albedo - often presumed primitive - material in the Solar System. 
Carbon, iron sulfide, magnetite and other materials have been proposed 
as the darkening agent(s). In this fourth discussion in the series 
(open to all interested LPSC attendees), we pursue this topic. What 
implications do these compositions have for understanding the 
processing and evolution of the Solar System? Our collection of carbon-
rich samples will expand in the near future when pristine samples of 
the near-Earth asteroids 162173 Ryugu and 101955 Bennu are returned to 
Earth. Providing a framework for the existence and processing of carbon 
throughout Solar System history improves our future analyses. 

This session will be kicked off by an introductory talk given by Dr. 
Larry Nittler, followed by open discussion among all attendees.

IUGG/IAMAS SESSION M24: CLOUDS AND CIRCULATIONS IN PLANETARY
ATMOSPHERES

Abstract deadline extended: March 1, 2019 at 12:00 CET (Central 
European Time)

We now have new information on clouds and atmospheric circulations,
including Earth. There are some similarities and many differences among 
the clouds, their origins and impacts. Especially, for all planets 
including Earth, cloud motions are a key measurement in studying global 
circulations and there have been recently many improvements in the 
techniques. The symposium invites presentations on the clouds or 
measurements involving clouds on different planets, including Earth.

Conveners: Kevin McGouldrick (USA), Emmanuel Marcq (France)
