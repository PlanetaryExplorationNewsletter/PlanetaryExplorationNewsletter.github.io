UPCOMING PROPOSAL WRITING WORKSHOPS FOR R&A PROPOSALS

The success of scientists depends upon their ability to obtain
funding. One of the largest challenges is to create strong proposals.
Using Research Opportunities in Space and Earth Sciences (ROSES) from
NASA Science Mission Directorate as a template, this presentation will
focus on teaching the audience key points to communicating science
through successful proposal writing. As a result of this session,
participants will be able to understand the proposal writing,
reviewing, and selection process for federally funded research. How to
understand one's values and maintain those throughout this process will
also be focused on during this workshop.

Workshops will be held at the follow locations:

The University of Hawaii at Manoa
Wednesday, Oct 30, 2019, 2-4 PM HST
POST 601
Note: registration not required. 
This will be a shortened Tips and Tricks Talk.

[NASA] AMENDMENT TO THE SALMON-3 AO
 
The common SALMON-3 AO body provides a base for investigations referred
to as Missions of Opportunity (MO). MOs are SALMON-3 amendments that
NASA releases as a separate, i.e., a lettered program element
appendix (PEA). Because NASA released PEAs lettered I through O prior
to the issuance of Amendment number 17, these existing PEAs are not
impacted by the Amendment 17 to the SALMON-3 Common AO body. PEAs
released after the date of Amendment 17, however, will be subject to
these changes unless otherwise specified in the PEA.

NASA made multiple changes that range from simple updates, e.g., a new
point of contact for SALMON-3's common AO body, formatting corrections,
e.g., typos, etc., to complex matters related to requirements, sections
and common appendices. 

Proposers should not rely on this email announcement of SALMON-3 AO
Amendment 17, because it is not a complete or verbatim summary of the
changes. Proposers must visit NSPIRES to download the SALMON-3 AO and
read carefully. For the full text search on "SALMON-3" under open
solicitations at:

Comments and questions: Michael.H.New@nasa.gov (subject line to read
"SALMON-3 AO").

EGU 2020 SESSION GM2.2: LANDFORM MAPPING

Please consider submitting an abstract to the following PICO session at
the 2020 EGU General Assembly (3-8 May 2020 in Vienna), which this year
has expanded its scope to include the theme of planetary mapping,
including landing site characterisation for planetary lander and rover
missions:

GM2.2 Landform mapping - recent advances in data collection and mapping
approaches

This session aims to showcase recent advances in landform mapping, and
we invite contributions related to mapping of specific landforms as
well as whole landsystems in different environments and on other
planetary bodies. We particularly welcome studies that (a) demonstrate
the potential of multi-method and innovative mapping approaches, (b)
showcase novel methods of data collection to solve previously
overlooked problems, or (c) present mapping of previously unmapped or
newly-emerging landscapes.

An introductory keynote will be given by Mark Johnson (University of
Gothenburg) on 'The LiDAR revolution in glacial geomorphology: its
gifts and challenges'.

MARS ARCHITECTURE STRATEGY WORKING GROUP IS ASKING FOR YOUR INPUT

The Mars Architecture Strategy Working Group (MASWG) requests
input on Mars mission concepts by Friday, November 22.
 
NASA has formed a Mars Architecture Strategy Working Group
(MASWG). MASWG would like to understand the types of mission
concepts that could be feasible to launch in the period 2020-2035, in
parallel with or following Mars Sample Return. 

We are asking the community to share high-level one-page descriptions
of potential mission concepts with the working group. The goal is to
understand the breadth of mission types and approaches in each size
class. This is not an opportunity for funding, to get your mission
concept into a queue, or to promote any single mission. All mission
types up through New Frontiers cost class are requested.

Submitters should use the template (email MASWGcomments@jpl.nasa.gov
for a copy) and submit to MASWGcomments@jpl.nasa.gov. All inputs will
be treated as confidential; submissions will be kept internal to the
MASWG and will not be distributed to NASA HQ or to the community.
 
Details of MASWG and this request will be discussed in the MEPAG
Virtual Meeting (VM7) on Wednesday, November 13.
