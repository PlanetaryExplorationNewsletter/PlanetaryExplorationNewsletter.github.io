OPEN RANK PROFESSOR OF EARTH AND PLANETARY SCIENCES

The Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences at Washington University 
in St. Louis invites applications for a tenure-track or tenured faculty 
position at the assistant, associate, or full professor rank, 
commensurate with experience, in the field of planetary science. The 
candidate is expected to perform research in the broad area of 
planetary surfaces and processes, have or seek active involvement in 
planetary science missions, and eventually assume leadership of the 
NASA Planetary Data System Geosciences Node at Washington University. 
The ideal candidate will employ quantitative tools and will integrate 
computational approaches with remotely sensed observations.  

Candidates must have a Ph.D. in planetary science or a related field at 
the time of appointment. In addition, candidates at the associate or 
full professor rank must have an advanced record of research, 
publication, and teaching warranting tenure. Complete applications 
include cover letter, curriculum vitae, statements of teaching and 
research interests, and names and contact information of at least four 
references, submitted via Interfolio: 

https://apply.interfolio.com/66099 

Applications must be received by October 31, 2019 to ensure

A FREE WORKSHOP FOR EARLY-CAREER ASTRONOMERS WHO WANT TO DO BETTER 
OUTREACH WITH STUDENTS AND THE PUBLIC

Friday and Saturday, January 3-4, 2020, in conjunction with the 235th 
meeting of the American Astronomical Society in Honolulu, HI.

The American Astronomical Society (AAS) is sponsoring a free 
skill-building workshop - and an ongoing community of practice - to 
support early-career astronomers in providing effective outreach to 
schools, families, and the public. The AAS Astronomy Ambassadors 
program (now in its eighth year) offers two days of hands-on training, 
extensive resources, and pre-tested activities - plus the opportunity 
to join a like-minded group of peers.

If you are a graduate student, postdoc, or recent faculty, and if 
you are interested in spending a fraction of your time helping 
students and the public become more scientifically literate, this is 
an invitation to sharpen your outreach skills and join the growing 
AAS Astronomy Ambassadors community.

Applications are due 4 Nov 2019. Space is limited, and successful 
applicants are accepted on a rolling basis, so we urge you to get your 
application in as soon as is practical.

AAS Astronomy Ambassadors program information is at:

https://aas.org/outreach/aas-astronomy-ambassadors-program

GRADUATE STUDENT POSITIONS IN PLANETARY SCIENCE, GEOCHEMISTRY, AND
GEOPHYSICS AT MICHIGAN STATE UNIVERSITY

The Geochemistry and Geophysics research groups in the Department of 
Earth and Environmental Sciences at Michigan State University are 
recruiting M.S. and Ph.D. students to start Fall 2020!

Our research groups offer opportunities to study tectonics and 
petrology at field sites around the globe, to image the Earth's 
interior, and to model physical and chemical planetary processes using 
laboratory and computational methods. Dynamic processes of our planet's 
interior over its history generated Earth's habitable surface and are 
responsible for the natural distribution of mineral resources and 
geologic hazards including earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, and 
tsunamis.

Research and teaching assistantships are available for highly 
qualified applicants and are awarded in fall of each year. In 
addition, several fellowships and scholarships provide additional 
financial support for summer stipends, conference travel, and research 
and field expenses. Thanks to our generous alumni, the EES department 
offers the most awards per capita of any department at MSU.

Feel free to contact faculty driectly via email. Interested students 
should visit our prospective graduate student webpage: 

https://ees.natsci.msu.edu/academics/graduate/application 

All are welcome to drop by our booths at GSA and AGU fall meetings!

NASA has released the NASA Research Announcement (NRA) titled "Use of 
the NASA Physical Sciences Informatics System - Appendix F," which 
solicits ground-based research proposals to generate new scientific 
insights by utilizing experimental data residing in NASA's Physical 
Sciences Informatics (PSI) system: 

http://psi.nasa.gov 

This online database provides investigators access to the raw and 
processed experimental data from physical science reduced-gravity 
flight experiments conducted on the International Space Station, Space 
Shuttle flights, Free Flyers, or commercial cargo flights to and from 
the ISS, and from related ground-based studies.

The current call for proposals solicits proposals in the five research 
areas - Combustion Science, Complex Fluids, Fluid Physics, Fundamental 
Physics, and Materials Science - for which eligible experimental data 
will be available in the PSI by the proposal due date of December 16, 
2019. Data from 63 investigations are eligible for this NRA. The call 
is open to two types of investigators: established researchers and 
graduate students. Anticipated award amounts, eligibility requirements,

ACCESS2SPACE

This Workshop is sponsored by the NASA Science Mission Directorate to 
gauge and solicit community inputs on the best way to create, fully 
populate, and manage a pipeline of secondary payloads to support the 
NASA SMD policy of adding a secondary payload carrier for all SMD 
missions with excess-mass lift capacity.

The goals of this Workshop are to provide the following info to 
decision makers:

- Identify shortfalls in current methodologies
- Understanding of new strategies to maximize available secondary 
  payloads to populate the Rideshare pipeline
- Definition of instrument/sensor use cases that maximize use of 
  excess-mass lift capacity
- Quantifying the potential increase of the science return on 
  investment
- Understanding of technology areas requiring new investment to use 
  the excess-mass lift capacity.
