FRIENDS OF LUNAR AND INNER SOLAR SYSTEM VOLATILES FOCUS GROUP

The Friends of Lunar and Inner Solar System Volatiles (FoLV) welcome 
all interested members of the community to join the group - an informal 
association of researchers with an interest in volatiles on the Moon 
and other targets of exploration. Our interests span both scientific 
and engineering aspects of planetary exploration. We meet monthly by 
telecon to discuss recent research results and other issues of interest 
to the community.

Past FoLV initiatives have included white papers, letters of support 
for NASA programs, virtual workshops, and an Icarus special issue on 
lunar volatiles. FoLV also serves as the SSERVI Volatiles Focus Group. 
In the coming year, preparing for the Planetary Science Decadal Survey 
will be a priority.

Membership is open to anyone with an interest in the subject. 
Participation is entirely voluntary, and at any level. To subscribe to 
the FoLV mailing list, visit: 

https://lists.hou.usra.edu/mailman/listinfo/folv 

Please let Parvathy Prem (parvathy.prem@jhuapl.edu) know if you have 
any issues.

Monthly telecons take place the second week of each month, alternating 
between Mondays 12-1 pm ET, and Tuesdays 4-5 pm ET. Connection 
information is sent via the listserv.

INTERNATIONAL OBSERVE THE MOON NIGHT - OCTOBER 5, 2019

International Observe the Moon Night is a worldwide celebration of 
lunar science and exploration, celestial observation, and the cultural 
and personal connections we have to the Moon. Everyone, everywhere can 
participate. You can join by hosting or attending an event, or 
registering as a lunar observer.

In 2019, a year of important lunar anniversaries, International Observe 
the Moon Night celebrates 10 years of lunar science engagement. With 
the 50th anniversary of the Apollo 11 Moon landing, an international 
fleet of robotic lunar explorers, and as we look forward towards 
Artemis, it's a great time to celebrate past, present, and future lunar 
exploration.

Learn more about International Observe the Moon Night, find program 
resources and event materials, and register your participation on:

EPSC/DPS WORKSHOP: CARBON IN THE SOLAR SYSTEM

Please join us for an engaging discussion on Thursday, Sept 19, 
10:30AM-noon, Pluto room (room 13).

Recent results ranging from the Pluto system, the Saturn system, other 
locations beyond ~5 AU, all the way to Mercury in the inner Solar 
System, and nearly all points in between, raise questions abut the 
state of carbon in the Solar System: how do carbonaceous compounds 
become weathered in response to thermal processes and irradiation? How 
do we recognize carbon compounds and their various weathering products? 
The synthesis of these results improves our scientific understanding of 
the role of carbon in the Solar System, how it evolves and how to 
recognize it. Analyses of samples from the carbonaceous near-Earth 
asteroids 162173 Ryugu and 101955 Bennu will provide context for the 
presence of carbon. In this workshop, please come prepared to discuss 
observational, laboratory and modeling work related to carbon and 
carbonaceous species on Solar System bodies. We will kick off the 
discussion with short presentations by Gianrico Filacchione and Lucille 
LeCorre.
