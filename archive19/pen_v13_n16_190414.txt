EPSC-DPS SESSION MIT4: PLANETARY EXPLORATION - HORIZON 2061

Abstracts are welcome to the EPSC-DPS 2019 session MIT4 on the 
foresight exercise Horizon 2061 for planetary exploration. The 
principal motivations are to inspire international collaborations to 
better meet technology and mission challenges and increase the overall 
science return of planetary exploration. This EPSC session devoted to 
"Planetary Exploration, Horizon 2061" will present the conclusions 
reached during the previous workshops to the participants to the 
EPSC-DPS conference, invite additional contributions, and stimulate 
future long-term forward-looking activities related to the sciences 
and technologies of Planetary Exploration.

We invite abstracts for oral and poster contributions from all areas 
of planetary exploration.

EPSC-DPS SESSION SB10: COMPUTATIONAL AND EXPERIMENTAL ASTROPHYSICS OF 
SMALL BODIES, PLANETS, AND GRANULAR SYSTEMS - OPEN QUESTIONS, 
CHALLENGES, NEW TECHNIQUES AND MODELS

This session is devoted to the development of models, experiments (on 
ground and in micro-gravity), and mathematical simulations 
(computational methods and algorithms of solution) related to the Small 
Bodies (comets, KBOs, rings, asteroids, meteorites, dust, gravitational 
aggregates), their formation and evolution, and the instruments of 
their exploration.

This session will include the introduction and discussion of new 
and/or existing models, experimental techniques, computational methods, 
and the results of analytical, experimental and numerical analysis 
(with respect to computational methods and algorithms of solution) of 
various astrophysical phenomena: (i) dusty gas cometary atmospheres; 
(ii) volcanic activity on icy satellites (e.g. Enceladus and Io); (iii) 
planetary body formation (e.g. via pebbles growth) and planetesimal 
dynamics; (iv) investigations on granular systems applicable to the 
study of small bodies as gravitational aggregates, regolith surfaces, 
and sample-return missions; etc.

EPSC-DPS SESSION TP6: MOON AND OTHER AIRLESS ROCKS

We would like to invite you to submit an abstract to Session TP6 "Moon 
and Other Airless Rocks" at the EPSC-DPS Joint Meeting on September 
15-20, 2019 in Geneva.

Abstracts are invited on any research related to Moon, moons, 
asteroids, and the interactions of airless rocks with the space 
environment. Earth's Moon has been our guide to cratering and other 
processes that affect airless rocks in space. Recent discoveries have 
shown that the Moon is not what we thought it was, suggesting we ought 
to re-examine our understanding of processes affecting airless rocky 
bodies and their surfaces.

More information about the session and a link to abstract submission 
can be found on:

Deadline is May 8.

SPICE TRAINING CLASS

A beginner's SPICE training class will be held in a hotel near 
Pasadena, California on June 4-6, 2019.

NASA's SPICE system is used for computing observation geometry for 
robotic science missions. It has been in use since the Magellan mission 
to Venus, and is now used on most worldwide planetary missions as well 
as on some heliophysics and Earth science missions. This three-day 
class is free of charge and is open to everyone involved with space 
science, including foreign nationals and commercial enterprises. 
Attendance will be limited to the first 60 registrants. Details about 
the class and the required registration form are found here:

NEOWISE 2019 DATA RELEASE 

The Near-Earth Object Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (NEOWISE) and 
IPAC at Caltech announce the NEOWISE 2019 Data Release.

The 2019 Data Release includes data acquired during the fifth year of 
the NEOWISE Reactivation mission (Mainzer et al. 2014, ApJ, 792, 30), 
December 13, 2017 to December 13, 2018. These data are combined with 
those from Year 1-4 NEOWISE into a single archive that contains 12.8 
million sets of 3.4 and 4.6 micron images and a database of ~95 billion 
source detections.  

NEOWISE scanned the sky nearly ten complete times during the first 
five years of its survey, with approximately six months between survey 
passes. With twelve or more independent 3.4 and 4.6 micron exposures 
on each point of the sky during each epoch, the NEOWISE archive is a 
time-domain resource for extracting multiple, independent thermal 
flux and position measurements of Solar System small bodies, as well 
as background galactic and extragalactic sources.

A quick guide to the NEOWISE data release, data access instructions 
and supporting documentation is available at: 

http://wise2.ipac.caltech.edu/docs/release/neowise/

NEOWISE is a project of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory/California 
Institute of Technology. NEOWISE is funded by the National Aeronautics 
and Space Administration Planetary Science Division.

ROCKY WORLDS: FROM THE SOLAR SYSTEM TO EXOPLANETS

January 6-8, 2020 (Monday-Wednesday) at the Kavli Institute, 
Cambridge, UK

This is to announce that registration for the Rocky Worlds meeting is 
now open, please find the link to register here:

https://www.kicc.cam.ac.uk/events/rocky-worlds-from-the-solar-system
-to-exoplanets

The planets that are best understood are the four telluric planets of 
our own Solar System. Applying the detailed understanding gleaned from 
these bodies is crucial in our interpretation of exoplanetary systems. 
As the characterisation of new exo-planetary systems proceeds it will 
in turn improve understanding of our own Solar System, and in 
particular of how habitable Earth-like planets may form. This workshop 
aims to bring together planetary scientists, astronomers, and Earth 
scientists to foster discussion and build the collaborations that will 
pave the way for the next decade of rocky exoplanet discovery and 
characterisation.

We encourage applications from all interested parties, although the 
meeting is limited to 50 participants. We particularly encourage early 
career scientists interested in forging collaborations across 
disciplines to apply. There will be no registration fee and a number 
of grants will be available to support travel costs, childcare costs,
or any other costs associated with accessibility.

Please contact rw2020@ast.cam.ac.uk if you have any questions.

POSTDOCTORAL FELLOWSHIP AT JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY: HYPERVELOCITY 
IMPACT

A new postdoctoral fellow position is available within the Hopkins 
Extreme Materials Institute (hemi.jhu.edu) at Johns Hopkins University 
in the area of hypervelocity impact experiments on geophysical and 
quasibrittle materials. The primary experiments will be performed at 
the new HyFIRE facility at Johns Hopkins, which achieves impact 
velocities of 7 km/s with rich diagnostics, including flash X-ray, 
ultra-high-speed optical visualization, photon doppler velocimetry, 
and high-speed spectral imaging.

The potential candidate should have a Ph.D. in mechanics, geophysics, 
planetary science, materials science, or physics. A willingness to 
work with modelers performing large-scale impact simulations is 
expected. An interest in data science and machine learning is a plus.

If you are interested, please send an email to ramesh@jhu.edu with a 
single PDF file containing your curriculum vitae, the names of at 
least two references, and a brief research statement. Please use the 
subject line "HEMI Postdoctoral Fellow in Hypervelocity Impact." Review 
of applications will begin May 15.
