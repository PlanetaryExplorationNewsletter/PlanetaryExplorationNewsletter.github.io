[NASA] RFI: RESEARCH THAT FALLS IN A GAP BETWEEN CURRENT SMD
SOLICITATIONS

Solicitation Number: NNH20ZDA003L
Release Date: Dec 2, 2019
Response Date: Jan 31, 2020
 
The NASA Science Mission Directorate is soliciting information on
research that is aligned with the agency mission and SMD's Science Plan
but falls in a gap between current solicitations, possibly because it
is interdisciplinary or interdivisional. Responses to this Request for
Information (RFI) will be used by NASA to inform a decision as to
whether the portfolio of current program elements in the Research
Opportunities for Space and Earth Science (ROSES) needs to be modified
and/or expanded to provide the proper avenue for such research.

The full text of the RFI and response instructions can be found at:

https://nspires.nasaprs.com/external/solicitations/summary.do?solId=%
7BD82B2B9A-5F6D-B0C6-741A-6950D1D6F0E1%7D&path=&method=init

Responses must be submitted electronically using the NSPIRES web site.
This RFI is open to responses from all parties including commercial
entities, international organizations, academia, NASA Centers, and
other government agencies.
 
Questions concerning this Request for Information may be addressed to:

ANNOUNCEMENT OF BILL FELDMAN SCIENCE SYMPOSIUM, APRIL 23-24, 2020

In April 2020, Bill Feldman is turning 80 years and his friends and
colleagues would like to honor him with a symposium of talks covering
the wide variety of scientific disciplines to which he has made
significant contributions. These include: spaceflight instrument
development; solar and magnetospheric physics; planetary nuclear
spectroscopy; lunar, Mars, Mercury, and asteroid science; and
fundamental physics (e.g., neutron lifetime).

Invited and contributed talks will include both a review of the
contributions made by Bill and/or a discussion of the current state of
the fields. All are invited to attend and participate in invigorating
and enjoyable scientific discussions.

Los Alamos National Laboratory is hosting the symposium, which will
take place in Los Alamos, NM at the Cottonwood on the Greens on April
23-24, 2020. A dinner/banquet will be held on the evening of April 23.

Please indicate your interest either in attending and/or giving a talk
by sending a note to Sarah Balkey (slbalkey@lanl.gov), with copies to
David Lawrence (David.J.Lawrence@jhuapl.edu) and Katherine Mesick
(kmesick@lanl.gov). 

For meeting logistics, go to:

[NASA] ROSES-19: AUTONOMOUS ROBOTICS RESEARCH FOR OCEAN WORLDS AND DUE
DATE FOR COMMENTS DELAYED

This amendment provides more time for comments, inserts a new section
about intellectual property rights, and provides a link to information
about the Ocean Worlds Testbeds, and information about testbed
scheduling.

The Applied Information Systems Research (AISR) program that seeks
innovative ideas for applying advanced information and related
technologies to increase life cycle effectiveness and efficiency of SMD
programs. This DRAFT for community comment is for an instance called
Autonomous Robotics Research for Ocean Worlds (ARROW) to develop
autonomy software systems to significantly increase the robustness and
productivity of future Ocean Worlds lander missions.

Specifically, ARROW would seek functional and system-level autonomous
capabilities for future Ocean Worlds lander missions that:

a) increase the productivity of surface science operations; 
b) reduce the frequency of ground control contact and uplink/downlink
command cycles necessary for surface science operations; and 
c) enable autonomous adaptation to spacecraft faults, degradations,
failures or other unexpected conditions.

The time period for public comment has been extended to December 10,
2019 to allow for comments on the Testbed documentation; no other
changes to the schedule are expected. Comments on the draft text are to
be provided via email to cmercer@nasa.gov.

EARLY CAREER SUPPORT FOR OPAG MEETING
 
The next Outer Planets Assessment Group (OPAG) meeting will be held on
February 3-4, 2020 at the Lunar and Planetary Institute (LPI) in
Houston, TX. NASA will provide travel grants for a limited number of
Early Career participants to attend this OPAG meeting. OPAG plays a key
role in sculpting the planetary science community's input into NASA
activities for outer planets science and exploration. Thus it is
critical for Early Career scientists to attend these meetings both to
learn how NASA and Planetary Science programs operate and to represent
the community that will work on OPAG-relevant projects in the coming
decade. Selection preference will be given to U.S. citizens or lawful
permanent residents (green card holders), or those in residence at U.S.
institutions. Selected individuals will present a poster at the meeting
the evening of February 3 on a topic of their choosing. Interested
graduate students, postdocs, and other Early Career scientists (within
5 years of PhD/MS/BS) should submit a short letter of interest and a CV
to Morgan.L.Cable@jpl.nasa.gov by December 30, 2019. Please include
"OPAG Early Career Travel Grant" in the subject line. Recipients will
be notified by January 6, 2020.

CHAIRED PROFESSOR IN ONBOARD SPACE SYSTEMS

Lulea University of Technology invites applications for the position
of a chaired professor in the field of Onboard Space Systems. The
position is based at the Space Campus in Kiruna, Sweden.

Kiruna is referred to as Sweden's Space Capital, because it is home of
many space-related actors such as the ESTRACK Kiruna Station of the
European Space Agency, the European Space and Sounding Rocket Range
Esrange, the scientific headquarters of EISCAT, and the Swedish
Institute of Space Physics.

LTU's Division of Space Technology offers a Master programme in Space
Engineering with national intake, an international master programme in
Spacecraft Design, and the international Joint Master Programme in
Space Science and Technology - SpaceMaster. These programmes gather
more than 100 students from all over the world to Kiruna every year.

The current projects in Onboard Space Systems focus on near-Earth
objects and CubeSats. The newly established NanoSat and Asteroid
Engineering laboratories offer many opportunities for scientific
experiments and technological tests.

Candidates with documented experience in ongoing or completed space
missions are especially encouraged to apply.

The deadline for applications is January 5, 2020.

DIRECTOR/DEPARTMENT HEAD - LUNAR & PLANETARY LABORATORY/PLANETARY
SCIENCES

Since its founding in 1960, the Lunar and Planetary Laboratory (LPL) at
the University of Arizona (UArizona) has been at the forefront of
planetary science and solar systems research. LPL currently leads some
of NASA's highest-profile missions and instruments and is continuously
seeking future opportunities. LPL is engaged in a broad range of
research that includes theoretical, experimental, and observational
investigations of our Solar System, as well as exoplanets and their
origins. LPL integrates spacecraft missions and cutting-edge analytical
facilities into its research portfolio, and its teaching and graduate
program produces scholars who become leaders in the field. The
successful candidate will have demonstrated excellence in planetary
science research, strong leadership and management skills, teaching
experience, and a commitment to diversity. The Director is expected to
lead LPL in developing and executing a clear vision during a period of
expansion. The LPL Director works with local and external stakeholders
such as NASA and NSF to maintain and grow an enriching environment
conducive to excellence in planetary science research, education, and
exploration. For full position description and to apply online, please

2I/BORISOV OBSERVING CAMPAIGN WEBSITE

A world-wide effort is underway to observe and characterize the
interstellar comet 2I/Borisov as it passes through our Solar System.
The University of Maryland’s Small Bodies Campaign series is announcing
a website to support the organization of observations and data sharing
by 2I/Borisov observers. The products and services provided through the
website are similar to those for previous campaigns, such as were
conducted for 46P/Wirtanen and 1999 KW4 over the past year. The website
link can be found at:

http://wirtanen.astro.umd.edu/obs_campaigns.shtml

Users are encouraged to announce observations and share results from
past, ongoing, and future observing activities involving 2I/Borisov.
