2020 PIERAZZO INTERNATIONAL STUDENT TRAVEL AWARD

Application deadline: 9 PM PST, December 6, 2019

Awards will be announced on or before December 13, 2019.

This award is established by the Planetary Science Institute in memory
of Senior Scientist Betty Pierazzo to support and encourage graduate
students to build international collaborations and relationships in
planetary science. Two awards will be made each year, contingent upon
there being meritorious applications. One will be awarded to a graduate
student working on his or her Ph.D. at an institution within the U.S.
This is to support travel to a planetary science related meeting
(conferences and workshops) outside of the U.S. The second award will
be to a graduate student working on his or her Ph.D. at an institution
outside of the U.S. This is to support travel to a planetary science
related meeting within the U.S. These include general meetings that
have planetary-focused sessions such as the AGU, GSA, EGU and IAG.

The award will consist of a certificate and up to $2000US.

EGU 2020 SESSION PS3.7 - MINERALOGICAL AND GEOCHEMICAL STUDIES OF
PLANETARY ANALOGUE SAMPLES

Please consider submission of an abstract to EGU 2020 session (Vienna,
3-8 May 2020) on mineralogical and geochemical studies of planetary
analogue samples. Current space missions to Mars and small Solar
System bodies challenge our understanding of planets' evolution. To
provide better constraints, mineralogical and geochemical studies of
terrestrial analogues as well as of meteorites are carried out in line
with multi-method characterization of planets' surfaces. This session
aims to discuss current advances in analogue and experimental studies
and to foster discussion that can help definition of scientific need
for potential new analogue sites. The main objective will be Mars and
its aqueous alteration history, but contributions related to other
Solar System objects are welcome, if analogue samples are studied (or
needed).

We especially invite contributions related to: 1. Mineralogical and
geochemical characterization of terrestrial analogue sites, 2.
Laboratory experiments, 3. Creating, curating and distributing
collections of analogue rocks and simulants, 4. Multi-method analytical
databases on analogue rocks (and meteorites).

EGU 2020 SESSION PS4.2: MARS SCIENCE AND EXPLORATION 

We would like you to invite to submit an abstract to the session PS4.2:
"Mars Science and Exploration" of the EGU2020 to be held in Vienna on
3-8 May 2020.

The deadline for the abstract submission is 15 January 2020, 13:00 CET
or, for those applying for EGU Roland Schlich travel support, 1
December 2019, 13:00 CET.

With three rover launches scheduled in 2020, another giant leap in Mars
exploration is expected in the next decade. In this session, we welcome
contributions about lessons learned from past/current missions,
terrestrial analog studies, as well as future exploration and
prospects.

TOWARDS OTHER EARTH III: FROM SOLAR SYSTEM TO EXOPLANETS (REGISTRATION
NOW OPEN)

1-5 June 2020
Lamego, Douro Valley, Portugal

Atmosphere, interior, formation and evolution of planets and planetary
systems. The Solar System Planets and Exoplanets communities aim at
answering similar questions, but seldom interact due to the different
datasets they have access to. Our goal is to discuss how the detailed
and in situ datasets from Solar System planets can inform the often
under-constrained exoplanetary models. We will try to understand how
the diversity and large sample offered by exoplanets can put in context
and inform our understanding of Solar System planets, focusing on each
of these categories:

1. Super-Earths, Mercury, Venus, Mars and Earth
2. Ice giants, Uranus and Neptune
3. Gas giants, Jupiter and Saturn
4. Planetary System architecture

PH.D. OPPORTUNITY, MARS SURFACE STUDIES, UNIVERSITY OF HAWAI'I AT MaNOA

Motivated student sought to pursue research relevant to the Mars 2020
rover investigation, which will land in Jezero Crater in early 2021.
See:
 
http://mars.nasa.gov/mars2020/mission/overview/

Area of specialization will be determined based on mutual interest and
the details of the geology encountered by the rover, but might include
some combination of analysis of geologic features observed in
multispectral image data, quantitative modeling of the observed
features, and interpretation in the context of the regional to global
history of Mars. In addition, a proportion of the student's time will
be spent on mission operations in support of the Mastcam-Z stereo
multispectral camera investigation. A good grounding in geosciences,
physics, and mathematics is desirable, as is previous planetary,
volcanology, or Mars-focused research, and/or experience in mission
operations. For more information please contact Sarah Fagents
(fagents@hawaii.edu). The UH Manoa application deadline is January 15,
2020.

NOV 22 DEADLINE TO SEND MARS MISSION CONCEPTS TO MARS ARCHITECTURE
STRATEGY WORKING GROUP

This is a reminder that the Mars Architecture Strategy Working Group
(MASWG) is requesting your input on Mars mission concepts no later than
Friday, November 22.

Original message from Bruce Jakosky, MASWG Chair: "... we are asking
the community to share high-level one-page descriptions of potential
mission concepts with the working group. The goal is to understand the
breadth of mission types and approaches in each size class. This is not
an opportunity for funding, to get your mission concept into a queue,
or to promote any single mission. All mission types up through New
Frontiers cost class are requested. Submitters should use the template
(email MASWGcomments@jpl.nasa.gov to request this file), should keep
the descriptions to an absolute maximum of one page, and submit these
via email to MASWGcomments@jpl.nasa.gov by end of day on Friday,
November 22. All inputs will be treated as confidential; submissions
will be kept internal to the MASWG and will not be distributed to NASA
HQ or to the community."

Details of MASWG and this request were discussed in the MEPAG Virtual
Meeting (VM7) held on Wednesday, November 13. Bruce’s VM7 presentation
will be posted in the next week:
