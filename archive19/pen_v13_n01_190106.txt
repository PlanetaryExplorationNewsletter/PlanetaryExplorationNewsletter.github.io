POSTDOCTORAL RESEARCH ASSOCIATE IN PLANETARY ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCE,
UNIVERSITY OF LEICESTER

Full Details:

https://jobs.le.ac.uk/vacancies/718/research-associate-in-planetary-
atmospheric-science.html

Salary Grade 7 - 34,189 to 39,609 pounds per annum
Available from 1 March 2019 to 31 March 2022
Closing date: 14 January 2019
 
The Physics and Astronomy Department at the University of Leicester
invites applications for a Post-Doctoral Research Associate (PDRA) in
Planetary Atmospheric Science. You will join a planetary science team
funded by the European Research Council (ERC), specialising in the
application of radiative transfer and spectral inversion to explore
atmospheric processes on the giant planets of our Solar System. You
will analyse and model spectroscopic datasets from world-leading
ground- and space-based facilities (e.g., Juno, VLT, and ultimately
JWST) to explore long-term atmospheric changes on the four giant
planets.
 
The ERC GIANTCLIMES project seeks to investigate the natural cycles
of meteorology, circulation, and chemistry shaping the environments on
the four giant planets. Inversions of planetary spectra will be used to
reconstruct these atmospheres in three dimensions to understand their
spatial and temporal variability.

ABSCICON 2019 SESSION: ALIVE OR NOT?
 
Alive or not? New strategies and techniques for recognizing biological
signatures from the abiotic noise.
 
https://agu.confex.com/agu/abscicon19/prelim.cgi/Session/67151

Submission deadline: 23 January 2019 23:59 EST
 
We would like to invite colleagues to submit abstracts to a session
that concentrates on the search for life and the abiotic conditions
that may favor its evolution (habitability). Despite significant
scientific and technological progress, a significant obstacle in our
search for life beyond Earth is that we still lack a clear
understanding of how to recognize its presence beyond the terrestrial
evolution context, nor do we fully know how to disentangle its
signatures from the myriad of abiotic geochemical processes at play.

This session will address constraining the formation of biosignatures
across space and time, and will explore new strategies, techniques, and
instruments for recognizing them from abiotic environmental noise. We
welcome contributions on experiments where abiotic and biotic factors
are considered, field studies in analogue environments and early Earth
deposits, as well as flight technologies/instruments for detecting
biosignatures from "life as we know it" and "life as we don't know it".

See you in Seattle!

ABSCICON 2019 SESSION: SALTY GOODNESS: UNDERSTANDING LIFE, BIOSIGNATURE
PRESERVATION, AND BRINES IN THE SOLAR SYSTEM

Submission Deadline: 23 January 2019 23:59 EST

https://agu.confex.com/agu/abscicon19/prelim.cgi/Session/67232

Pure liquid water is only stable in a small fraction of the Solar
System; however, salty aqueous solutions (i.e., brines) are more
broadly stable. These brine systems however, prove to be some of the
most challenging environments for microorganisms, where biology must
overcome extreme osmotic stresses, low water activities, chemical
toxicity, and depending on the location of the environment, temperature
extremes, UV radiation, and intense pressure. 

This session is intended to encourage multidisciplinary and cross
planetary discussions focused on the phase space of habitability within
brines. We seek to discuss 1) the potential and stability of brines on
host worlds through both laboratory and modeling experiments, 2)
microbial ecology and adaptations to brines, 3) the effects of water
activity and chaotropicity on habitability, 4) the ability of
hypersaline systems to preserve biomolecules and 5) techniques and
technology needed to detect biosignatures in these unique systems.

IAS 2019 SESSION ON PLANETARY SEDIMENTARY GEOLOGY: MARS AND TITAN

International Association of Sedimentologists Meeting
Rome, Italy
September 10-13, 2019

Abstracts: January 15 - March 30

Session 7.14 Planetary Sedimentary Geology:

Studies in Martian sedimentary geology have never been more active.
Orbital imagery has revealed a vast, ancient stratigraphic record and
rover missions have enabled detailed sedimentological studies combined
with mineralogical and chemical analyses.

A growing list of geomorphic landforms is also known from Titan, though
it remains uncertain whether the moon has a more ancient stratigraphic
record. As on Earth, extraterrestrial sedimentary rocks may archive
information pertaining to ancient climate, tectonics and potentially,
life. Considering ongoing and future exploration missions aim to find
potentially habitable environments, sedimentary rock outcrops therefore
make desirable targets. This session invites any contribution towards
Martian and Titan sedimentary geology and geochemistry. In addition to
the classic contributions, we particularly welcome presentations that
utilise appropriate Earth analogues, both modern and ancient. As
ongoing and upcoming rover missions are providing increased opportunity
to study extraterrestrial sedimentary strata, understanding directly
accessible Earth analogues from which to base comparisons has never
been more essential.

LAST CALL EGU 2019: ATMOSPHERES AND EXOSPHERES OF TERRESTRIAL PLANETS,
SATELLITES, AND EXOPLANETS

This is the last call for abstract submission to EGU 2019, held in
Vienna on 7-12 April. 

Deadline: 10 Jan 13:00 CET

I would like to draw your attention to our session PS1.8/AS4.58:
Atmospheres and exospheres of terrestrial planets, satellites, and
exoplanets

This session primarily focuses on the neutral atmospheres of
terrestrial bodies other than the Earth. This includes not only Venus
and Mars, but also exoplanets with comparable envelopes and satellites
carrying dense atmospheres such as Titan or exospheres such as
Ganymede. We welcome contributions dealing with processes affecting the
atmospheres of these bodies, from the surface to the exosphere. We
invite abstracts concerning observations, both from Earth or from
space, modeling and theoretical studies, or laboratory work.
Comparative planetology abstracts will be particularly appreciated.

If you consider submitting an abstract in this session, you can use the
following link:

Hope to see you in Vienna!

Best regards,

The conveners
