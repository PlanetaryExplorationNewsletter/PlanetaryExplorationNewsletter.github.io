THE PI LAUNCHPAD: FROM SCIENCE IDEA TO NASA MISSION

If you are a researcher in any NASA Science Mission Directorate (SMD)
discipline who wants to take your career to the next level but have not
yet held a leadership position on mission proposals or large science
teams, this is the workshop for you.

Participants will go step-by-step through the process of developing a
science case, defining requirements, building a team, securing
partnerships, and obtaining support from the home institution.

We are interested in broadening the pool of potential NASA space
mission PI's. People with potentially intersecting marginalized
identities are strongly encouraged to apply. There is no cost to attend
the workshop; travel, meals, and lodging for non-NASA participants will
be covered by the Heising-Simons Foundation.

We will select between 35-40 participants. For those not selected, we
are planning to hold additional Launchpads in 2020 and beyond.
Applicants should be currently at US institutions. More details to
come. Please watch:

Applications due: October 4, 2019
Selections made: October 21, 2019
Workshop Dates: November 18-20, 2019
Workshop Location: University of Arizona Campus, Tucson, AZ

INTERNATIONAL OBSERVE THE MOON NIGHT - OCTOBER 5, 2019

International Observe the Moon Night is a worldwide celebration of
lunar science and exploration, celestial observation, and the cultural
and personal connections we have to the Moon. Everyone, everywhere can
participate. You can join by hosting or attending an event, or
registering as a lunar observer.

In 2019, a year of important lunar anniversaries, International Observe
the Moon Night celebrates 10 years of lunar science engagement. With
the 50th anniversary of the Apollo 11 Moon landing, an international
fleet of robotic lunar explorers, and as we look forward towards
Artemis, it's a great time to celebrate past, present, and future lunar
exploration.

Learn more about International Observe the Moon Night, find program
resources and event materials, and register your participation on:

JOB ANNOUNCEMENT: PHOTOGRAMMETRIST

The USGS Astrogeology Science Center is looking for a Photogrammetrist
(GS-11/12 Physical Scientist). We work in coordination with NASA and
other agencies to support missions to planetary objects across the
Solar System. If you are looking for a rewarding position in the
Federal workforce and have expertise in photogrammetry and software
development, we need your help! Job duties include developing software,
algorithms, and/or guidelines for mapping planetary data; developing
planetary sensor models that define the transformation between image
space and object space; producing improved geospatial knowledge of
extraterrestrial bodies and planetary datasets (e.g., spacecraft
ephemerides, digital elevation models, orthorectified images and
mosaics, metadata, and control networks); and providing guidance to
technical staff working on photogrammetric and geodetic production
tasks. Applicants must have a bachelors or higher degree in physical
science, engineering, or mathematics, expertise in the concepts,
theories, and principles of photogrammetry, cartography, geodesy,
and/or computer vision, and experience developing and modifying
software to apply these principles to highly varied datasets.
Applicants must be US citizens, and a background check is required.
This position is located in Flagstaff, AZ. Apply starting September 2,
2019 through USAjobs.gov announcement DEN-2019-0254:
