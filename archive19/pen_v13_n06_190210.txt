EDITOR KAREN STOCKSTILL-CAHILL DEPARTING PEN

PSI Senior Scientist Karen Stockstill-Cahill has been volunteering her 
time as a Planetary Exploration Newsletter editor since March 13, 2016.
That is nearly three years of weekends during which she has diligently
edited and co-edited 144 issues of PEN, helping and communicating with 
submitters, and making a lot of judgement calls. It has been a pleasure
working closely with her over this time, and we will miss our regular
interactions with her. We wish her the best of luck in all her new and
continuing endeavors!

We would also like to welcome PSI Senior Scientist Georgiana Kramer to 
our editorial team.

MOON MINUTE MONDAY (M3)
  
Fascinated by the Moon's geological diversity and inspired by NASA's
Astronomy Picture of the Day (APOD), Moon Minute Monday (M3) has been
created. Go to:

https://moonmonday.space/

Every Monday, M3 features an interesting lunar geological feature, its 
scientific importance and need to send a lunar landing mission to the 
site. It also shows a map of where on the Moon the feature lies.

The site covers a variety of geological features, from craters to 
valleys and mountains to rilles. One can even browse features by 
categories and get started on lunar exploration. The aim of the website 
is to have people looking up to the Moon again in this New Space Age.

The site name, "M3" (pronounced "M-cubed"), is an ode to the 
Chandrayaan-1 instrument, Moon Mineralogy Mapper.

AOGS SESSION PS03: EXPLORATION OF MARS - NEW RESULTS, CURRENT MISSIONS 
AND FUTURE PLANS

The last 20 years of Mars exploration have completely changed our view 
of the red planet. What was once thought to be a lunar-like, cratered 
and geologically dead planet has now been revealed to be 
mineralogically diverse and geologically complex, with many active 
processes operating even today. Furthermore, while we do not know how 
life formed on Earth, it is now clear that habitable environments where 
life could have arisen were widespread on ancient Mars. The future is 
bright for Mars exploration as space agencies around the world plan to 
send a fleet of spacecraft to the planet in coming years. This session 
invites contributions from all elements of Mars sciences, including 
geology, geophysics, geomorphology, climate science, astrobiology and 
more. We are interested in projects focused on theory, experiment, 
observation and analog studies.

AOGS SESSION PS04-SE: VOLCANISM AND TECTONISM ACROSS THE SOLAR SYSTEM

Abstract deadline: February 12, 2019 (SGT)

The surfaces of the terrestrial planets and their satellites have been 
largely shaped through volcanic and tectonic processes. Extreme 
conditions on outer Solar System bodies, such as the Jovian and 
Saturnian satellites, result in different types of volcanism and 
tectonism. Fracturing and faulting processes mainly affect minor 
bodies such as asteroids and small moons, where volcanism and tectonism 
have not played an important role. We invite contributions that cover a 
wide range of topics including geomorphology and composition of 
volcanic deposits, edifices, and plumes, volcano-induced deformation 
and edifice growth and collapse to tectonic structures, faulting and 
fracturing processes, crustal stress and strain analysis, 
cryovolcanism, and any study related to planetary endogenic processes. 
Furthermore, studies that relay interactions between planetary 
interiors, surfaces, and atmospheres are welcomed. Comparative studies 
of volcanic or tectonic systems on Earth with a strong remote sensing 
component are encouraged.

AOGS SESSION PS14: SMALL BODY EXPLORATIONS BY CURRENT AND FUTURE 
MISSIONS

Abstract deadline: February 12, 2019 (SGT)

This session welcomes abstracts about the new results of Solar System 
small bodies from past and ongoing exploration missions, and about the 
development and concepts of future missions. We also welcome abstracts 
about the related ground-based observations, laboratory experiments, as 
well as theoretical studies. Abstracts reporting the new results from 
Dawn, New Horizons, Hayabusa2 and OSIRIS-REx missions are especially 
welcome. In the context of the recent wave of small body exploration 
missions, as well as the future missions currently under development 
and/or consideration by NASA, ESA, JAXA, China, etc., this session is 
designed to promote the research of Solar System small bodies from the 
past and current missions and to help develop concepts for future 
missions.

Conveners: Jian-Yang Li (PSI), Jiangchuan Huang (CAST), Yangting Lin

[NASA] ROSES-18: PLANETARY PROTECTION RESEARCH

This amendment solicits proposals to program element C.15 Planetary 
Protection Research, which had previously been listed as "Not solicited 
this year".

Planetary Protection is the practice of protecting Solar System bodies 
from contamination by Earth life and protecting Earth from possible 
life forms that may be returned from other Solar System bodies. 
Numerous areas of research in astrobiology/exobiology are improving our 
understanding of the potential for survival of Earth microbes in 
extraterrestrial environments, relevant to preventing contamination of 
other bodies by Earth organisms carried on spacecraft. As we continue 
to bring extraterrestrial samples back to the Earth system for advanced 
research and analysis, there is an urgent need to understand and 
prevent biological contamination of the terrestrial environment. 
Mission-enabling and capability-driven research is required to improve 
NASA's understanding of the potential for both forward and backward 
contamination; and improve methods and technologies for accurate, 
efficient, and effective minimization of biological contamination for 
outbound spacecraft and return samples.

Notices of Intent are requested by April 12, 2019 and proposals are due 
by May 10, 2019.

COSMIC LAB WORKSHOP

The international workshop "Cosmic Lab" aims to share know-how,
experience, and ideas to perform advanced research on extraterrestrial
materials in space. The workshop offers a platform for knowledge 
sharing and brainstorming over various types of research in so-called 
cosmic environments (an ultra-high vacuum, microgravity, harsh 
radiation, etc.). Its main focus is space-borne in-situ measurements; 
balloon-, rocket-, and satellite-borne experiments; space-telescopic 
observations including, but not limited to, ground-based experiments 
for development and calibration of spacecraft instruments, and analysis 
of the data achieved in the outer space. Numerical simulations and 
theoretical predictions for the detection of extraterrestrial materials 
are also welcome. Go to:
