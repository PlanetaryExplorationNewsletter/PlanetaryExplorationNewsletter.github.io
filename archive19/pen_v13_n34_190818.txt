AAS SPECIAL SESSIONS: KUIPER BELT AND NEW HORIZONS RESULTS AT 2014 MU69

We invite all Kuiper Belt researchers to submit abstracts to the 
upcoming AAS meeting to be held January 4-8 in Honolulu, HI. The 
meeting will have a significant Kuiper Belt component, including a 
special session featuring the results of New Horizons' encounter with 
2014 MU69. Contributed oral and poster presentations more broadly 
addressing all aspects of the Kuiper Belt and related objects are 
enthusiastically encouraged.

This is an excellent opportunity for Kuiper Belt researchers to meet 
with other AAS scientists who don't usually attend DPS or other 
planetary meetings, and discuss interests that could cut across other 
fields and develop complementary projects.

Submit your abstract by October 8 at 9:00 PM ET at:

https://aas.org/meetings/aas235

When selecting the Session Type for your abstract, you will have the 
option to submit to the special session if desired, which is titled: 
"New Horizons Results at 2014 MU69". If you submit an abstract to the 
special session, it does not count against your allotment of regular 
abstracts for the general meeting.

If you have questions, you can contact the session co-chairs Joel 
Parker (joel@boulder.swri.edu) and Cathy Olkin 
(colkin@boulder.swri.edu).

FACULTY AND POSTDOCTORAL POSITIONS IN INDIA

School of Earth and Planetary Sciences (SEPS), National Institute of 
Science Education and Research (NISER), Bhubaneswar, is one of India's 
premier research-driven academic institutes. SEPS/NISER is a unique 
center in India that has been established to emerge and excel in high 
quality and interdisciplinary scientific research works in Planetary 
Sciences, Earth Sciences, and Atmospheric-Ocean Sciences. NISER 
provides start-up grant and academic freedom for promising candidates.

SEPS seeks faculty applications from highly motivated and promising 
candidates for faculty positions at various levels. Interested 
candidates should send their application to fa@niser.ac.in

Current faculty members in SEPS are involved actively in Indian and 
large international collaborative projects and astronomy/planetary
/exoplanetary missions, e.g., SKA, TMT, ALMA, NASA's JWST, SOFIA and 
Dawn. Interdisciplinary works on astrochemistry & astrobiology, star 
& planet formation, radio/sub-mm/infrared astronomy, exoplanets, 
planetary minerology & morphology, small bodies & meteorites, 
planetary remote sensing, land-atmosphere coupling, boundary layer 
dynamics, current challenges in climate change, etc., have been 
initiated already.

Applications and positions are subject to rolling basis as per 
NISER/DAE norms:

-Advertisement-2017.pdf

NISER/SEPS also highly welcome candidates who are interested in 
prestigious independent faculty/fellowship program, for example, 
Ramanujan Fellowship, DST INSPIRE Faculty, SERB-NPDF etc.

FINAL ANNOUNCEMENT FOR ICARUS SPECIAL ISSUE ON KUIPER BELT SCIENCE

Kuiper Belt and Trans-Neptunian discoveries have been accelerating 
over the past two decades. NASA's New Horizons spacecraft initiated the 
close-up exploration of Kuiper Belt objects with the flybys of the 
Pluto system the cold classical KBO 2014 MU69 (nicknamed Ultima Thule). 
In addition, many advances have been made in telescopic observations 
and theoretical modeling of the Kuiper Belt and Dwarf Planets. This 
special issue calls for results related to the exploration of the Pluto 
system, the Kuiper Belt, and Kuiper Belt Objects, particularly by New 
Horizons, ground-based techniques, and NASA's New Frontiers Data 
Analysis Program (NFDAP) projects. Papers are solicited from authors 
across the planetary science community and interdisciplinary papers 
are welcome.

Revised paper submission deadline: October 1, 2019

Topics of interest include, but are NOT limited to:

* Geologic mapping and geomorphologic analyses
* Geophysical and geochemical modeling
* Particle or plasma data
* Dynamical or collisional evolution modeling
* Analysis of the composition and photometric properties
* Atmospheric measurements or modeling
* Ground- or space-based telescopic data
* Laboratory analysis of analog materials

DPS PROFESSIONAL CULTURE AND CLIMATE SUBCOMMITTEE (PCCS) SEEKING NEW
MEMBERS

Are you interested in making the planetary science community more 
diverse and inclusive? If so, contact Julie Rathbun to volunteer to be 
part of the DPS Professional Culture and Climate subcommittee (PCCS). 
A list of our charge, duties, and expectations can be found at: 

https://dps.aas.org/leadership/climate 

You can also find Julie at the DPS meeting in Geneva to discuss the 
PCCS. Please send an email to rathbun@psi.edu by the end of the DPS 
meeting on September 20, 2019 and include why you are interested, a 
brief discussion of any EDI work you've already done, and a brief 
statement on what you hope to accomplish as part of the PCCS).

EPSC/DPS WOMEN IN PLANETARY SCIENCE DISCUSSION HOUR 2019

Date: Wednesday, Sept. 18, 2019

Time: 12:00-1:15 PM

Place: EPSC/DPS Conference venue
       Geneva, Switzerland
       Saturn Lecture Room

Join us for the annual Women in Planetary Science event over lunch. All 
are welcome! We will discuss professional development topics related to 
diversity and inclusion in planetary science. The presentation/
discussion schedule will be announced on the registration page. 
Pre-registration is required to receive a lunch (available to the 
first ~200 registrants due the generosity of our sponsors: Aura and 
Southwest Research Institute), and registration is recommended even if 
you are bringing your own lunch so we can balance room size with 
attendance size. Registration deadline to receive a lunch is August 31.

Pre-registration, More details and RSVP is at:

CARBON IN THE SOLAR SYSTEM: EPSC/DPS WORKSHOP

Please join us for an engaging discussion on Thursday, Sept. 19, 
10:30AM-Noon, Pluto room (Room 13)

Recent results ranging from the Pluto system, the Saturn system, other 
locations beyond ~5 AU, all the way to Mercury in the inner Solar 
System, and nearly all points in between, raise questions abut the 
state of carbon in the Solar System: how do carbonaceous compounds 
become weathered in response to thermal processes and irradiation? How 
do we recognize carbon compounds and their various weathering 
products? The synthesis of these results improves our scientific 
understanding of the role of carbon in the Solar System, how it 
evolves and how to recognize it. Analyses of samples from the 
carbonaceous near-Earth asteroids 162173 Ryugu and 101955 Bennu will 
provide context for the presence of carbon. In this workshop, please 
come prepared to discuss observational, laboratory and modeling work 
related to carbon and carbonaceous species on Solar System bodies. We 
will kick off the discussion with short presentations from 1-2 invited 
speakers.
