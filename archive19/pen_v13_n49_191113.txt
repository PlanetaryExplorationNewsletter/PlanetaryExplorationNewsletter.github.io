EXOPLANETS IN OUR BACKYARD: SOLAR SYSTEM AND EXOPLANET SYNERGIES ON
PLANETARY FORMATION, EVOLUTION, AND HABITABILITY

PLEASE NOTE CORRECTION: The abstract deadline is November 20,
2019

The Exoplanets in Our Backyard Workshop will be held February 5-7,
2020, at the Lunar and Planetary Institute, in Houston, Texas,
immediately following the Outer Planets Assessment Group (OPAG)
meeting.

The workshop is co-organized with the Venus Exploration Analysis Group
(VEXAG), the Outer Planets Assessment Group (OPAG), and the
Exoplanet Exploration Program Analysis Group (ExoPAG), to increase
much-needed collaboration between the exoplanet and Solar System
science communities. The goals of the workshop are to examine and
discuss exoplanet-solar system synergies on planetary properties,
formation, evolution, and habitability. We invite abstracts for
contributed oral and poster presentations that focus on: comparative
planetology; Solar System studies as a baseline to inform studies of
extrasolar planetary properties and evolution; and lessons learned on
planetary statistics, demographics, and system architectures from
extrasolar planetary systems. The workshop aims to foster and build
new collaborations among scientists in the Solar System and exoplanet
communities and to help guide the direction of future exploration and
observations of worlds in the Solar System and beyond.

The abstract deadline has been extended to November 20, 2019. For more
