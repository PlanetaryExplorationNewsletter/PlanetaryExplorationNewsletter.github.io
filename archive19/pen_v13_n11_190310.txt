IN MEMORIAM: JAY T. BERGSTRALH (1944-2019)

It is with great sadness that we report the death of our colleague, Dr.
Jay T. Bergstralh on February 16, 2019, at age 75 after a long battle
with progressive aphasia and dementia. At JPL he conducted original
research on the atmospheres of Venus, Jupiter, Saturn and Uranus and on
Jupiter's satellite, Io, primarily from ground-based astronomy; he also
worked on the Voyager mission Photopolarimeter System team. He took on
the role of Science Organizing Chair for the first American
Astronomical Society's Division for Planetary Sciences meeting in
Pasadena, California, in 1978. While at JPL he also became the first
Chair of the DPS from a NASA field center in 1986-1987. Following the
Voyager flyby, he organized a conference on the Uranus system and was
the lead editor of the comprehensive book Uranus, published in 1991 by
the University of Arizona Press. During his tenure at NASA
Headquarters, Jay managed the Planetary Atmospheres research grants
program, became the Associate Director for Solar System Exploration and
Program Scientist for the Galileo, Cassini, Europa Orbiter and
Messenger missions, and for the Discovery Program.

CALL FOR ABSTRACTS: GEOMUENSTER 2019 CONFERENCE

22-25 September
Muenster, Germany

This conference covers multiple geoscientific topics including one
planetary theme: "Structure and evolution of planetary bodies".

We look forward to receiving your abstracts for this theme and the
following session in particular: "High-spatial resolution studies of
small-scale and complex extraterrestrial and terrestrial samples".

Investigations of heterogeneous samples like meteorites, interplanetary
dust particles, or returned mission samples require the application of
high-spatial resolution analytical techniques to minimize sample
destruction and maximize contextual information. This also applies to a
wide variety of terrestrial rocks and experimental analogues that
document the evolution of planetary bodies (e.g., impact-generated
lithologies, shocked minerals, fluid/mineral inclusions, high-pressure/
high-temperature experiments, synthetic nanomaterials). In this
session, we welcome contributions from geo-cosmochemistry-material
sciences disciplines that make use of high-spatial resolution methods
(e.g., electron microscopy, laser-ablation and secondary ion mass
spectrometry, atom probe tomography, Raman spectroscopy, and
synchrotron radiation techniques) that improve our understanding of
small-scale chemical, isotopic and structural properties and processes.
Cross-disciplinary contributions giving possible new insights into old
problems are particularly encouraged.

Horizon 2000 Plus, and Cosmic Vision - the Voyage
2050 plan relies on open community input and on broad peer review. The
community input will be gathered through a Call for White Papers, while
the peer review of this input will take place through a two-tiered
committee structure, with a Senior Committee of 13 European scientists
supported by a number of Topical Teams. 

Scientists interested in participating in the peer review process are
invited to respond to the Call for Membership of the Topical Teams,
which invites applications from scientists working in ESA Member States

Application Deadline: 6 May 2019, 12:00 (noon) CEST

The Call for White Papers solicits ideas from the scientific community
for the science themes that should be covered during the Voyage 2050

JMARS SHOWCASE AT LPSC

Thursday, March 21, 12:00 to 1:00 PM, Shenandoah meeting room

The JMARS team will present a series of short presentations on how
specific science analysis can be done on planets, moons, and small
bodies. The goal of these presentations will be to showcase how to use
JMARS to discover available data sets, filter them to refine relevance,
and fuse them with one another in order to evaluate research hypotheses
and produce publication quality results. JMARS (Java Mission-planning
and Analysis for Remote Sensing) is a free, open-source, Java-based
geospatial information system developed by the Mars Space Flight
Facility at Arizona State University. It is currently used for search
and analysis of scientific data collected for multiple bodies (Mars,
Earth, Moon, Vesta, Ceres, and many more) across various planetary
missions.

OPAG MEETING
 
The next Outer Planets Assessment Group (OPAG) meeting will be held 
April 23-24, 2019 at NASA Headquarters in Washington DC.
 
https://www.lpi.usra.edu/opag/meetings/upcoming/
 
Early Career participant support:
 
NASA will provide travel grants for a limited number of interested
Early Career participants to attend the OPAG meeting April 23-24, 2019
in Washington DC. OPAG plays a key role in sculpting the planetary
science community's input into NASA activities for outer planets
science and exploration. Thus it is critical for Early Career
scientists to attend these meetings both to learn how NASA and
Planetary Science programs operate and to represent the community that
will work on OPAG-relevant projects in the coming decade. Selection
preference will be given to U.S. citizens or lawful permanent residents
(green card holders), or those in residence at U.S. institutions.
Selected individuals will present a poster at the meeting on a topic of
their choosing. Interested graduate students, postdocs, and other Early
Career scientists (within 5 years of PhD/MS/BS) should submit a short
letter of interest and a CV to Morgan.L.Cable@jpl.nasa.gov by March 20,
2019. Recipients will be notified by March 29. For more information,

2019 NASA PLANETARY SCIENCE SUMMER SEMINAR APPLICATIONS OPEN

NASA is accepting applications from science and engineering post-docs,
recent PhDs, doctoral students, junior faculty, and engineering
students within 6-9 months of completion of their master's degree but
not planning to pursue a PhD degree, and junior faculty for its 31st
Annual Planetary Science Summer Seminar. PSSS is a 12-week long career
development experience from May 20 - August 9, 2019, with an onsite
culminating week August 5-9, 2019 at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in
Pasadena, Calif.

During the 11 weeks of virtual webinar sessions and the onsite
culminating week at JPL, student teams will carry out the equivalent of
an early mission concept study, prepare a proposal authorization
presentation, present it to a review board, and receive feedback. By
the end of the experience, students will have a clearer understanding
of the life cycle of a space mission; relationships between mission
design, cost, and schedule; and the tradeoffs necessary to stay within
cost and schedule while preserving the quality of science.

Applications are due April 1, 2019. Partial financial support is
available for a limited number of individuals. Further information:

WORKSHOP ON POLARIZATION IN PROTOPLANETARY DISKS AND JETS

May 20-24, 2019
Sant Cugat del Valles, Catalonia Spain

https://sites.google.com/view/sant-cugat-forum-astrophysics/
next-session

The study of the formation and evolution of protoplanetary disks around
young stars saw a tremendous boost by the advent of ALMA and the
development of new capabilities in the infrared and radio telescopes,
thanks to the huge combined improvement in sensitivity, angular
resolution, and image fidelity. However, the role of magnetic fields in
the formation and evolution of disks around young stars is still a
poorly understood topic. Are protoplanetary disks and protostellar jets
magnetized? Polarimetric observations are the primary means to obtain
information regarding the magnetic fields. However, this technique can
be hampered by other polarization mechanisms such as dust self
scattering, radiation alignment of aspherical grains or anisotropic
resonant scattering of linear polarization of molecular lines. The main
goal of this focused meeting is to bring together observers and
theoreticians interested in the study of magnetic fields in
protoplanetary disks and protostellar jets as well as polarization
mechanisms to review the current state of the research and explore
effective means to probe magnetic fields.
