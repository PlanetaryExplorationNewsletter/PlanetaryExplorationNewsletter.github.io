AGU SESSION DI007: EXPLORING MARS WITH INSIGHT, FIRST-YEAR RESULTS

Please note this session is listed under Studies of Earth's Deep 
Interior (DI) but cross listed in the Planetary Section.

Session Description: InSight landed on Mars on November 26th, 2018, 
bringing the first geophysical observatory to the surface of Mars to 
measure deep interior structure and processes. At the time of the fall 
meeting, the mission will have been on the surface for just over a 
year, with the primary science mission planned to last through the end 
of 2020. This multi-disciplinary session will gather together results 
welcoming all research, whether part of the mission team or not. 
Results from all InSight-related efforts, including the seismic 
instrumentation, pressure, wind and magnetic sensors, radiometer and 
heat flow probe, cameras, and radio science are encouraged. Further, 
we encourage laboratory or theoretical investigations that aid in the 
interpretation of mission data. Studies related to the high-level 
goals of the mission to constrain the Martian interior, as well as 
those illuminating other areas such as surface geology, atmospheric 
processes and future mission design are encouraged.

Conveners: 

Mark Panning, Ebru Bozdag, Scott King, and Foivos Karakostas

AGU SESSION EP018: EARTH 4D - A DEEP DIVE INTO THE HABITABILITY OF THE
BLUE PLANET

Conveners: Barbara Sherwood Lollar, Jack Mustard and Maggie Osborne

Leaving the thin surface veneer of the Blue Planet, investigations of 
the subsurface architecture of the marine and terrestrial subsurface 
are challenging our understanding of the distribution and age of water, 
fluxes of elements like carbon in and out of the subsurface, and the 
character and distribution of energy. Recent discoveries are 
transforming our understanding of habitability and the limits to life 
in the subsurface. How might our current understanding these systems 
be limited if our focus remains primarily on surficial, or high energy, 
or recent and readily accessible systems? What inferences can be draw 
from the Earth's subsurface processes to inform the exploration of 
other planets and moons? This session will address how novel processes 
of energy production and transport in the crust, models of 
hydrogeologic connectivity (and/or isolation), and long-term transport 
and reaction timescales are providing new insight though the 
integration of biology, hydrogeology, geochemistry, and planetary 
science.

AGU SESSION P003: ATMOSPHERIC PROCESSES, PARTICLES, AND CHEMISTRY

We are pleased to invite abstract submissions to a cross-disciplinary 
session on Atmospheric Processes, Particles, and Chemistry (P003) at 
the AGU 2019 Fall Meeting in San Francisco, CA.

Abstract submission deadline: 31 July 2019, 11:59 pm EDT

https://agu.confex.com/agu/fm19/prelim.cgi/Session/76911

Many of the chemical and microphysical processes occurring in 
planetary atmospheres have direct similarities to those studied in 
the Earth's atmosphere. The aim of this session is to bring together 
atmospheric expertise from Earth and planetary communities to share 
knowledge and techniques across traditional boundaries. We encourage 
submissions from all areas of atmospheric studies, including but not 
limited to experimental and/or theoretical studies of gas phase 
composition, chemistry, dynamics, and particle (aerosols and clouds) 
formation and evolution. We encourage existing cross-disciplinary 
efforts as well as abstracts describing techniques that could be 
applied to other bodies, and submissions describing a gap in 
knowledge that could be addressed collaboratively. We intend to use 
the "short talk" format to maximize information exchange and
encourage participants to initiate conversations that could lead to 
future collaborations and new research investigations.

AGU SESSION P018: IMPACT OF COSMIC DUST IN PLANETARY ATMOSPHERES

Recent advances in interplanetary dust measurements and modeling 
provide much improved estimates of the fluxes and the origin of cosmic 
dust particles into planetary (and lunar) atmospheres. Dust dynamics 
models, combined with chemical ablation models that are underpinned by 
laboratory studies and tested against radar and optical observations, 
enable the injection rates of chemical compounds (including metals and 
organics) into a planet's atmosphere to be predicted as a function of 
location and time. This information is essential for understanding a 
variety of atmospheric impacts, including: the formation of metallic 
layers, meteoric smoke particles and ice cloud nucleation on Earth and 
Mars; perturbations to atmospheric composition in the giant planets and 
their satellites; and the supply of biologically important organics, 
phosphorus and iron to planetary surfaces. Contributions on all aspects 
of this topic - observations both in interplanetary space and 
atmospheres, laboratory studies and modeling - are invited.

AGU SESSION P032: RETURNING TO THE MOON, THE SCIENCE OF EXPLORATION

We are pleased to invite you to submit an abstract for the following 
session at the 2019 AGU Fall Meeting in San Francisco, CA, 
December 9-13, 2019.

The session will focus on how the close collaboration between science, 
technology and exploration will enable deeper understanding of the 
Moon and other airless bodies as we move further out of low-Earth 
orbit. The Solar System Exploration Research Virtual Institute 
(SSERVI) will focus on the scientific aspects of exploration as they 
pertain to the Moon, Near Earth Asteroids (NEAs) and the moons of Mars.
This session will feature interdisciplinary, exploration-related 
science centered around all airless bodies targeted as potential human 
destinations. Areas of study reported here will represent the broad 
spectrum of lunar, NEA, and Martian moon sciences encompassing 
investigations of the surface, interior, exosphere, and near-space 
environments as well as science uniquely enabled from these bodies.
Graduate students and early career researchers are particularly 
encouraged to submit for oral presentations.

AGU SESSION P034: SPACE ENVIRONMENTS OF UNMAGNETIZED OR WEAKLY 
MAGNETIZED SOLAR SYSTEM BODIES AND THE EFFECTS OF SPACE WEATHER ON 
THESE SYSTEMS

The ionospheres and magnetospheres of weakly magnetized bodies with 
substantial atmospheres (e.g. Mars, Venus, Titan, Pluto and comets) 
are subject to disturbances due to solar activities, interplanetary 
conditions, or parent magnetospheric environments (e.g. solar flares, 
coronal mass ejections and solar energetic particles), sharing 
similarities with their magnetized counterparts but with scientifically 
important differences. As an integral part of planetary atmospheres, 
ionospheres are tightly coupled with the neutral atmosphere, exosphere 
and surrounding plasma environment, possessing rich compositional, 
density, and temperature structures. The interaction among neutral and 
charged components affects atmospheric loss, neutral winds, 
photochemistry, and energy balance within ionospheres. This session 
invites abstracts concerning remote and in-situ data analysis, 
modeling studies, comparative studies, instrumentation and mission 
concepts for weakly magnetized Solar System bodies. Topics such as 
dayside and nightside ionospheric characteristics and variability, 
ion-neutral coupling, and responses of the ionized and neutral regimes 
to transient space weather events are especially encouraged.

AGU SESSION SM023: MAGNETOSPHERES IN THE INNER SOLAR SYSTEM

We are pleased to announce the following session and would like to 
invite the community to consider submitting an abstract to it for the 
upcoming AGU Fall Meeting 2019.

Session description:

The structure and dynamics of each planetary magnetosphere (intrinsic 
and induced) in the inner Solar System are driven by a unique set of 
factors including the nature of its magnetization, 
atmosphere-ionosphere coupling, and local solar wind parameters. To 
provide a forum for discussion of recent data analysis and modeling 
efforts concerning the inner planet magnetospheres, this session 
welcomes submissions on the intrinsic magnetospheres of Mercury and 
Earth, as well as the induced magnetospheres of Venus and Mars. It will 
focus on general magnetospheric processes including, but not limited 
to: solar wind-magnetosphere interactions, magnetosphere-ionosphere 
coupling, plasma acceleration and transport, magnetic reconnection, 
wave instabilities, magnetotail dynamics, and bow shock physics. We 
strongly encourage comparative studies of these inner Solar System 
magnetospheres with each other or with other planetary magnetospheres 
throughout the Solar System.

AGU SESSION V053: VOLATILES IN MAGMATIC PROCESSES AND PLANETARY 
EVOLUTION

The session is in VGP, not in Planetary, but we hope to have an equal 
number of submissions from both planetary and terrestrial studies. Go 
to:

https://agu.confex.com/agu/fm19/prelim.cgi/Session/80220

We invite studies aimed at understanding magmatic volatiles from the 
mantle to the atmosphere on Earth and other planets.

From dissolved volatiles to exsolved bubbles, and from deep planetary 
interiors to atmospheres, the volatile phase of magmatic systems plays 
a key role in planetary differentiation, volcanism, and the 
development of habitable worlds. Outstanding questions in the field 
include: How can we estimate global-scale volatile budgets of planets? 
How can volatiles in the geologic record be used to constrain magmatic 
activity in Earth's past, as well as on other planets and moons? What 
volatiles are most crucial to the habitability of exoplanets? We 
invite abstracts that seek to constrain the role of volatiles in 
planetary magmatic processes, through approaches including direct 
measurements of melt/fluid inclusions, crystals, and gases; remote 
sensing; experiments; and modeling.

Abstracts deadline: July 31, 2019.
