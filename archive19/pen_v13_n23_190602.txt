A WORKSHOP ON SMALL SOLAR SYSTEM BODIES

We would like to draw attention to a workshop devoted to the research
on small Solar System bodies which will take place in Akdeniz
University, Antalya, Turkey, on September 4-6, 2019.

The workshop aim is to shorten the gap for astronomers in understanding
the contemporary problems in dynamics and physics and the requirements
set up to observations. We plan to discuss the synergy of dynamics and
physics of these bodies, giving the possibility for analysis of their
observations and the corresponding follow-up programs.

Workshop website: 

http://www.asteroid2019.space

Topics: 
- Small Solar System bodies and natural satellites
- Analysis of their observations (astrometry, photometry, polarimetry,
spectroscopy, occultations) 
- Gaia catalog and Large Synoptic Survey Telescope 
- Follow up programs

Keynote speakers abstract submission: July 1 
Abstract on-line submission: August 4

The poster is also available:

We kindly ask you to distribute this info to all possibly interested
colleagues.

Sincerely,

PRE-PRINT VERSION OF THE REPORT FROM THE ICE AND CLIMATE EVOLUTION
SCIENCE ANALYSIS GROUP (ICE-SAG) NOW AVAILABLE

In October, 2018, the Mars Exploration Program Analysis Group (MEPAG)
Executive Committee chartered the Ice and Climate Science Analysis
Group (ICE-SAG) as part of their Mars community preparations for the
next Planetary Science Decadal Survey. The main aim of this SAG was to
identify and prioritize fundamental science questions related to the
recent and ongoing evolution of Mars volatiles and climate, and to
explore new mission approaches that could address these high-priority
science questions during the coming decade (2023-2032).

The Final ICE-SAG report is not yet fully complete, but the ICE-SAG
Co-Chairs and MEPAG Executive Committee agreed to post a Pre-print
version so as to provide the community with access to the report
content before the end of May. The Preprint version of the ICE-SAG
final report can be found at:

https://mepag.jpl.nasa.gov/reports.cfm?expand=topical. 

In this Pre-print, the report content is overall set, but some
formatting/cleanup is still needed and Appendix C will be added. The
links between sections will also be fixed. The final and clean document
is expected to be posted by end of June, and will be announced in the
Mars Science newsletter.

The MEPAG Executive Committee & ICE-SAG members hope this document will
be a useful resource for the community.

ABSCICON WORKSHOP ON INSTRUMENTATION FOR IN SITU EXPLORATION OF OCEAN
WORLDS
 
Dear Colleagues,
 
We would like to bring to your attention a short workshop at the
upcoming Astrobiology Science Conference (AbSciCon), in Seattle WA. The
workshop is on instrumentation for the in situ exploration of Europa
and Ocean Worlds and will be held on Wednesday, June 26, from 12:20-4
PM, in the Cottonwood Room at the Hyatt Regency Bellevue (the conference
venue). 
 
The workshop is free and open to all interested AbSciCon attendees, and
is intended to bring together scientists and potential instrument
providers for future missions to the surfaces of ocean worlds, such as
Europa, Enceladus, and Titan. The workshop will include several brief
overview presentations from the Europa Lander mission concept team at
JPL. There will be an opportunity for attendees to give 1-slide
overviews of potential instrument concepts. Discussions and
presentations on techniques for astrobiology, chemistry, geology, and
geophysics investigations are welcome, as are those related to sample
acquisition, handling, and processing.
 
If you are interested in attending, pre-registration is encouraged at
