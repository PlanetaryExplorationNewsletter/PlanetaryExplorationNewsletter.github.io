[NASA] COMMENT PERIOD FOR THE DRAFT 2019 AO FOR THE DISCOVERY PROGRAM

Due to the partial government shutdown, NASA has extended the open
period to provide comments on the Draft 2019 Announcement of
Opportunity (AO) for Discovery Program mission investigations. The
comment period is extended from its original date of January 16, 2019,
to February 11, 2019. The target release date for the final AO is not
yet set.
 
NASA released a draft of the Discovery 2019 AO on December 12, 2018. 
The text can be found on NSPIRES at:

https://nspires.nasaprs.com

Search "Open Solicitations" for "Draft Discovery" or “NNH19ZDA009J”.
Proposers are encouraged to read the Draft Discovery AO and provide
feedback for NASA’s consideration as the AO is finalized. 

Further information will be posted on the Discovery Program Acquisition
Website as it becomes available at: 

http://discovery.larc.nasa.gov/ 

Questions and comments on the draft AO may be addressed to: 

Dr. Curt Niebur 
Discovery Program Lead Scientist (acting)

TENURED GEOLOGY & GEOPHYSICS DEPARTMENTAL CHAIR AT LSU 

The Department of Geology and Geophysics, on the live-oak lined campus
of Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge seeks a research-oriented
geologist to serve as the chair. Go to:

https://www.lsu.edu/science/geology

This is an opportunity for a scholar, appointed at the full professor 
level or with equivalent experience, in the field of geosciences to 
lead the demographically and topically diverse research community 
that comprises our department.

We need a chair person with administrative expertise, leadership
history, and research productivity. Responsibilities include planning
and administering graduate and undergraduate academic programs in
Geology and Geophysics, fostering a promising strategic vision and
establishing new initiatives with the faculty (e.g., including an
emerging planetary initiative to explore Mars and beyond under College
of Science aegis). The chair will also guide promotion and tenure,
teach courses at a reduced load, maintain an externally funded research
program, and coordinate fundraising with the LSU Foundation to maintain
and enhance our strong historic ties with energy and environmental
industries. The position reports to the Dean of the College of Science,
Dr. Cynthia Peterson.

To apply go to:

AOGS SESSION ST07: SOLAR SUPER STORMS: IN THE PAST, PRESENT AND FUTURE

ST07 - Solar Super Storms: in the Past, Present and Future

The standard candle for a solar superstorm is the infamous 1959
“Carrington Event.” Events in the modern era from 1972, 1989 and 2003
are at least a factor of 2 or more smaller than the Carrington Event.
Another such event will happen again, it is only a matter of time. The
impact on our technological society could be severe and cost billions
to trillions.

Convener: Alex Young (NASA GSFC); Co-convener: James Green (NASA
Headquarters)

Join the discussion on the latest results on super storms. To submit
your abstract which closes February 12th go to:
