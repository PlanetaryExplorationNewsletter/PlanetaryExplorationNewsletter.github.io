EPSC-DPS SESSION EXO10/TP11: ADVANCES IN DEVELOPING QUANTITATIVE AND 
REALISTIC MODELS OF TERRESTRIAL PLANET FORMATION AND THEIR CHEMICAL 
COMPOSITIONS 

Abstracts are welcome to the EPSC-DPS 2019 session EXO10/TP11 on the 
formation of terrestrial planets in our Solar System and extrasolar 
planets. The past few years have witnessed great advances in the 
theories of planet formation and computational simulations of impacts 
in planetary systems. These advances have played fundamental roles in 
reshaping models of terrestrial planet formation and have placed them 
on the path to becoming quantitative (and, therefore, predictive). 
They have also paved the way for more realistic extension of these 
models to other planetary systems. We invite abstracts for oral and 
poster contributions from all areas related to theoretical, 
observational and experimental studies of terrestrial planet formation 
in our Solar System and extrasolar planets. 

Abstract deadline: May 8, 2019

EPSC-DPS SESSION SB5: TRANS-NEPTUNIAN OBJECTS AND THEIR DUST 
ENVIRONMENT, PLUTO, 2014 MU69, AND CENTAURS 

This session welcomes papers about the trans-Neptunian objects and 
their environment, including investigations of space weathering. We 
encourage scientific investigations based on both space and Earth-based 
observations as well as theoretical and laboratory investigations. 
Papers based on observations and measurements obtained from within the 
Kuiper Belt are particularly encouraged including those focusing on 
2014 MU69 (a target of the New Horizons mission). We also welcome 
papers about the Pluto system including investigations of the geology, 
composition, atmosphere, climate and environment. Papers on processes 
that may be active in the Pluto system are particularly encouraged and 
include topics such as formation of organics in Pluto's atmosphere and 
surface, or seasonal/climatic models of volatile transports.

This session will also welcome abstracts devoted to studies of the 
Centaurs, in particular on their structure, composition, dynamics and 
activity patterns. We invite studies that describe observations, 
theory, experimental work, and future spacecraft encounters.

The abstract submission deadline is May 8, 2019, 13:00 CEST. 

https://meetingorganizer.copernicus.org/EPSC-DPS2019/session/34462 

Please join us in Geneva, Sept. 15-20 2019, for what is sure to be a 
great meeting.

EPSC-DPS SESSION MIT10: MACHINE LEARNING AND DEEP LEARNING FOR
PLANETARY SCIENCES

EPSC-DPS, Geneva, Switzerland, September 15-20, 2019

Abstracts are welcome to the EPSC-DPS 2019 session MIT10 on Machine
Learning and Deep Learning for planetary sciences. Machine Learning is
the subfield of computer science that gives "computers the ability to
learn without being explicitly programmed." As tactical and strategic
planning timelines compress and increasingly large nonlinear datasets
are acquired, autonomy and machine intelligence has to play a more
critical role in the interpretation of data from planetary exploration
missions and laboratory measurements. There is a need for capable
systems that can rapidly and intelligently extract information from
these datasets in a manner useful for scientific analysis. This session
will explore research that leverages machine learning methods to
enhance our scientific understanding of planetary data, from
astronomical observations, planetary exploration missions, as well as
numerical simulations. Science objectives as diverse as image
recognition, atmospheric retrieval, analysis of observed time series
and of numerical simulation addressed through a variety of machine and
deep learning tools will be considered. We invite contributions from 
all areas related to machine learning and deep learning applied to 
planetary sciences.

Abstract deadline: May 8, 2019

MARS NATIONAL IS LAUNCHED

Mars Nation is a global democratic movement to accelerate the 
colonization of Mars and to give everyone equal access to the planet's 
resources. We strive to bring a new collaboration framework to the space 
sector with an integrated funding model.

For more information visit:

www.marsnation.io

As a first step, we plan to build a global Mars mosaic from NASA CTX 
images to build the most accurate Mars map available that we want to 
open source for the scientific community. We achieve this by aligning 
and stitching single images with automated machine learning algorithms 
developed by one of our team members who was a main contributor to the 
i-Mars project funded by ESA.

plasma processes

http://www.irfu.se

We are searching for a total of three persons to work on the following 
projects:

1) Direct observation of anomalous resistivity in collisionless 
plasmas, and its importance for magnetic reconnection, based on 
measurements of electric and magnetic fields and charged particles by 
the four NASA MMS satellites.

2) Energy budget of the topside ionosphere and upper thermosphere, 
based on observations by the three ESA Swarm satellites.

3) Investigation of the dynamics of the terrestrial magnetosheath
