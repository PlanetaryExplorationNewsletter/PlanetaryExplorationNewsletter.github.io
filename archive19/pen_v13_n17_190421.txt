EPSC-DPS SESSION SB2: LABORATORY MEASUREMENTS AND MODELS FOR COMETARY,
ASTEROIDAL, DWARF PLANET AND METEORIC MATERIAL STUDIES INCLUDING
ORGANIC MATTER STUDIES
 
This session aims to highlight the new challenges and the missing
bricks needed to understand the composition of primitive bodies through
laboratory works and models. The session focuses on the origin of
inorganic and organic matter in different astrophysical environments
and welcomes contributions on laboratory investigations and models of
parent bodies of various meteorite groups, asteroids, comets and dwarf
planets such as: a) experimental work related to the dust-regolith
composition; b) observation and characterization of laboratory
analogues; c) models of comet formation, and interior structure of
asteroids with implications for parent body processes and evolution of
small bodies in our solar system. The session will also focus on
experimental, theoretical and observational topics specifically aimed
to the study organic matter in planetary bodies, including a) detection
and evolution of organic compounds in the interstellar medium; b)
characterization and evolution of the organic matter in the primitive
bodies (meteorites, comets, IDPs); c) observation and distribution of
the organic matter in the protosolar disk and planetary surfaces.

EPSC-DPS SESSION OPS3: OCEAN WORLDS AND ICY MOONS 

Abstract submission deadline: May 8, 2019, 13:00 CEST

September 15-20, 2019
Geneva, Switzerland

https://meetingorganizer.copernicus.org/EPSC-DPS2019/session/34052

The set of known and suspected ocean worlds continues to expand,
leading to intense interest in their viability as potential habitats
that may be or may have been inhabited. Previous missions such as
Cassini-Huygens, Galileo and New Horizons provide a major incentive for
future exploration of the icy Galilean satellites with Europa Clipper
and JUICE. Understanding ocean worlds and preparing for their
exploration requires input from a variety of scientific disciplines:
planetary geology and geophysics (including active processes, e.g.
plumes), atmospheric physics, life sciences, magnetospheric
environment, space weathering, as well as supporting laboratory
studies, preparatory studies for future missions and technology
developments in instrumentation and engineering. We welcome abstracts
that span the full breadth of disciplines that apply to the icy moons
in the outer Solar System with potential liquid oceans underneath, and
their exploration.

EPSC-DPS SESSION ODA3: DIVERSITY AND INCLUSIVENESS IN PLANETARY
SCIENCES

Please consider submitting an abstract to session ODA3: Diversity and
Inclusiveness in Planetary Sciences

The benefits of diversity and inclusiveness in the scientific community
are incontrovertible. This session aims to foster debate within the
planetary sciences community about the reasons behind
under-representation of different groups (gender, cultural, ethnic
origin and national) and best practices to make the research
environment more inclusive identifying and addressing barriers to
equality.

EPSC-DPS SESSION EXO10/TP11: ADVANCES IN DEVELOPING QUANTITATIVE AND
REALISTIC MODELS OF TERRESTRIAL PLANET FORMATION AND THEIR CHEMICAL
COMPOSITIONS

Abstracts are welcome to the EPSC-DPS 2019 session EXO10/TP11 on the
formation of terrestrial planets in our solar system and extrasolar
planets. The past few years have witnessed great advances in the
theories of planet formation and computational simulations of impacts
in planetary systems. These advances have played fundamental roles in
reshaping models of terrestrial planet formation and have placed them
on the path to becoming quantitative (and, therefore, predictive). They
have also paved the way for more realistic extension of these models to
other planetary systems. We invite abstracts for oral and poster
contributions from all areas related to theoretical, observational and
experimental studies of terrestrial planet formation in our solar
system and extrasolar planets.

GEOMUENSTER 2019: COMMUNICATING (GEO-)SCIENCE!

September 22-25, Muenster, Germany
Abstract deadline: May 15, 2019

Communication of scientific questions and results is gaining in
importance. We invite you to exchange your experience with Science
Communication in session 13d) "Communicating (geo-)science" at this
year's Geomuenster conference:

http://www.geomuenster2019.de

Making science accessible for everybody, and shaping discussions about
key geoscience issues such as climate change, natural hazards or
biodiversity helps rebutting fake news and answering the question "Why
do we need fundamental research?". In times where the effects of
man-made climate change are scientifically sound but publicly in doubt,
the communication of scientific results to policy makers, journalists,
and the general public becomes increasingly important. This session
aims at bringing together various and innovative strategies to
communicate science to a broad audience. How do you communicate your
scientific work? Tell us for example about your citizen science
project(s), science-related social media or public outreach activities.
We especially invite unconventional contributions such as multimedia
reports, public exhibits, press releases, etc. Please indicate in your
abstract what you intend to present, and in which form (e.g. poster,
exhibit, digital report, etc.). We look forward to receiving many
interesting submissions!
