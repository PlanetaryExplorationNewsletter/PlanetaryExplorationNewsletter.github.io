meeting is required by all who are funded by NASA to make geologic maps
to be published by the USGS, but it is also open to anyone in the
community making or interested in making geologic maps of other worlds.
June 12-13 will be meeting days and June 14 will include GIS software/
practices updates. Abstracts in LPSC-style are due on Thursday, April
4. Full information can be found on the meeting website:

EPSC-DPS SESSION TP20: IONOSPHERES OF UNMAGNETIZED BODIES IN THE SOLAR
SYSTEM AND THEIR RESPONSES TO SPACE WEATHER ACTIVITY - TERRESTRIAL
PLANETS AND COMETS
 
Geneva, Switzerland
15-20 September 2019

We encourage abstract submissions to our EPSC-DPS 2019 session. The
session will focus on the analysis of ionospheres of weakly magnetized
bodies with substantial atmospheres (e.g. Mars, Venus, Titan, Pluto and
comets), and how each body reacts to space weather disturbances.
Understanding how each unmagnetized body reacts to all these factors is
a key in comparative aeronomy because although a priori all of them
have a general similar behavior, they also have scientifically
important differences caused by their different natures. We solicit
abstracts concerning remote and in situ data analysis, modeling
studies, instrumentation and mission concepts. Topics may include, but
are not limited to, day and night side ionospheric variability, sources
and influences of ionization, ion-neutral coupling, current systems,
comparative ionospheric studies, and solar wind-ionosphere interactions
and responses of the ionized and neutral regimes to transient space
weather events. Abstracts on general plasma and escape processes are
also welcome.

EPSC-DPS SESSION SB1: DYNAMICAL AND PHYSICAL CHARACTERISATION OF SMALL
BODIES WITH GAIA AND THE NEW GENERATION OF SURVEYS
 
This session welcomes abstracts describing results, developments, and
perspectives on the discovery or the physical and dynamical
characterisation of the small bodies of our Solar System using ground
based and space-borne telescopic surveys. Results related to the
utilisation of the stellar and Solar System objects catalogs published
in Gaia DR2 are especially welcomed.
 
This session invites also abstracts about future Gaia data releases
and their perspectives (asteroid mass measurements, the detection of
Yarkovsky acceleration on objects, and spin/shape properties from
photometry), as well as other future surveys or missions.
 
The abstract submission deadline is May 8, 2019, 13:00 CEST. Please

EPSC-DPS SESSION OS1: ICE GIANT SYSTEMS

This session welcomes abstracts addressing all aspects of ice giants
systems including the internal structure of the ice giants, the
composition, structure, and processes of and within ice giant
atmospheres, ice giant magnetospheres, satellites, and rings, and the
relationship to exoplanetary systems. The session will comprise a
combination of solicited and contributed oral and poster presentations
on new and continuing studies of the ice giant systems and the
connection of the ice giants to our current understanding of
exoplanetary systems.

2019 NASA PLANETARY SCIENCE SUMMER SEMINAR APPLICATIONS OPEN

NASA is accepting applications from science and engineering post-docs,
recent PhDs, doctoral students, junior faculty, and engineering
students within 6-9 months of completion of their masters degree but
not planning to pursue a PhD degree, and junior faculty for its 31st
Annual Planetary Science Summer Seminar. PSSS is a 12-week long career
development experience from May 20 - August 9, 2019, with an onsite
culminating week August 5-9, 2019 at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in
Pasadena, CA.

During the 11 weeks of virtual webinar sessions and the onsite
culminating week at JPL, student teams will carry out the equivalent of
an early mission concept study, prepare a proposal authorization
presentation, present it to a review board, and receive feedback. By
the end of the experience, students will have a clearer understanding
of the life cycle of a space mission; relationships between mission
design, cost, and schedule; and the tradeoffs necessary to stay within
cost and schedule while preserving the quality of science.

Applications are due April 8, 2019. Partial financial support is
available for a limited number of individuals. Further information is
available at:

http://psss.jpl.nasa.gov

A SOFTWARE ROADMAP FOR SOLAR SYSTEM SCIENCE WITH THE LARGE SYNOPTIC 
SURVEY TELESCOPE

Schwamb et al. (in press) - Published in the Research Notes of the AAS
 
https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2515-5172/ab0e10/meta

The 8.4-m Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) will provide an 
unprecedented view of the Solar System. LSST will detect millions of 
asteroids and tens of thousands of distant Solar System bodies, within 
approximately 16 and 24.5 mag (in r-band). Over a ten year period, most 
of these minor planets will receive hundreds of observations divided 
between 6 filters (ugrizy). What specifically LSST project will deliver 
for Solar System detections will soon be updated in the LSST Data 
Products Definition Document. The LSST Solar System Science 
Collaboration (SSSC) 

http://www.lsstsssc.org

produced a science roadmap which outlines the collaboration's highest
ranked research priorities utilizing LSST. To achieve these science
goals, the SSSC has identified crucial software products and tools that
will be required but will not be provided by the LSST project. These
will have to be developed by the SSSC and the broader planetary
community. To spur this effort, we present this list of LSST community
software development tasks.

NASA FDL 2019 SUMMER RESEARCH SPRINT: CALL FOR APPLICANTS

NASA Frontier Development Lab (FDL) is an applied Artificial
Intelligence (AI) research sprint that pairs researchers from the space
sciences with data scientists for an intense 8-week concentrated study
to apply AI to challenges important to space exploration, and to
humankind. FDL will run between June 24 - August 16, 2019 in Silicon
Valley, CA.

We are looking for doctorate or post-doc researchers interested in the
following confirmed challenge areas for 2019: 

- Disaster prevention, progress and response
- Expanding the capabilities of NASA's Solar Dynamics Observatory
- Lunar resource mapping / super resolution 
- Fireball detection and classification
- Generation of simulated biosensor data
- Small-sat swarms and distributed AI

The 8-week format encourages rapid iteration and prototyping to create
tools and discoveries with meaningful application, such as NASA
Technical Memos, deployed AI systems and peer-reviewed publications.

We welcome applications for the 2019 program. Researchers are requested
to specify an interest in a specific challenge area. Applications will
be accepted until the closing date of April 12, although we encourage
you to apply sooner to ensure a place.

Session 7.14 Planetary Sedimentary Geology: from remote sensing and
in-situ datasets, numerical modelling, experiments and terrestrial
analogues

Studies in Martian sedimentary geology have never been more active.
Orbital imagery has revealed a vast, ancient stratigraphic record and
rover missions have enabled detailed sedimentological studies combined
with mineralogical and chemical analyses. A growing list of geomorphic
landforms is also known from Titan, though it remains uncertain whether
the moon has a more ancient stratigraphic record.

As on Earth, extraterrestrial sedimentary rocks may archive information
pertaining to ancient climate, tectonics and potentially, life.
Considering ongoing and future exploration missions aim to find
potentially habitable environments, sedimentary rock outcrops therefore
make desirable targets. This session invites any contribution towards
Martian and Titan sedimentary geology and geochemistry. In addition to
the classic contributions, we particularly welcome presentations that
utilise appropriate Earth analogues, both modern and ancient. As
ongoing and upcoming rover missions are providing increased opportunity
to study extraterrestrial sedimentary strata, understanding directly
accessible Earth analogues from which to base comparisons has never
been more essential.
