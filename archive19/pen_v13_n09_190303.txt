IN MEMORIAM: SWEDISH SPACE PIONEER BENGT HULTQVIST HAS PASSED AWAY

It is with great sorrow that we report that Professor Emeritus Bengt 
Hultqvist, the founder of the Swedish Institute of Space Physics, has 
passed away at the age of 91.

It is largely thanks to Bengt Hultqvist that space activities in 
Sweden, and in particular in Kiruna, have had such a dramatic 
development. During Bengt Hultqvist's 37 years as Director of the 
Swedish Institute of Space Physics (IRF), space activities in Kiruna 
in the far north of Sweden developed from six people in 1957 to some 
450 (including about 100 students) in 1994.

COMET INTERCEPTOR MISSION PROPOSAL: CALL FOR SUPPORT

Comet Interceptor, a mission to a dynamically new comet or interstellar 
target, is proposed for the European Space Agency's F-class call. It is 
on a shortlist of six concepts invited to submit proposals by March 20, 
2019.

The mission would launch in 2028 and be 'parked' at Sun-Earth L2 for up 
to 2-3 years, until an opportunity for a suitable comet encounter 
presents itself. Appropriate targets will be comets whose trajectories 
suggest that they on their first visit to the inner Solar System. Once 
a target is found, expected within a few years based on predicted Large 
Synoptic Survey Telescope discovery rates, the spacecraft will depart on 
an intercept trajectory. Before the flyby, sub-spacecraft will be 
deployed, allowing separate, parallel paths through the coma. This will 
provide 3D observations of the nucleus, coma, and Solar wind 
interaction. As well as targeting a previously-unvisited, much less 
evolved class of active comet, the unique multipoint measurements 
complement previous missions' single point observations. Significant 
contributions from Japan and the USA are anticipated.

CONGRESSIONAL GOLD MEDAL NOMINATION FOR THE FLATS

Starting in 1960, 13 experienced female pilots underwent many of the 
same physical and psychological tests as the Mercury 7 astronauts and 
often performed better. Though they never flew in space, the First Lady 
Astronaut Trainees (FLATs), also known as "the Mercury 13", provided 
evidence that women would be able to tolerate space's extreme 
environments.

GOLDSCHMIDT CONFERENCE SESSION 1A: PLANETARY CHEMISTRY IN THE AGE OF 
SOLAR SYSTEM EXPLORATION

Call for abstracts.

Meteorites and samples returned from space exploration missions have
provided much of what we know about the origin of the Solar System and
the timescales and processes involved during the formation of planetary
bodies. For decades to come, meteorite analysis, planetary exploration,
and sample return missions from bodies throughout the Solar System -
comets, asteroids, the Moon, and Mars - will provide critical insights
about the origins of the Solar System, planets, and life. The results
will also guide the development and direction of future sample return
missions. This session seeks contributions focusing on planetary
material analyses and analogues, remote observations, development of
biodetection techniques, and physical constraints in order to address 
a broad range of questions related to cosmochemistry, planetary 
formation, evolution of planetary surfaces, formation of habitable 
worlds, and also the search for evidence of life past and present 
beyond Earth.

POSTDOCTORAL POSITION IN SPACE PHYSICS - WORK WITH DATA FROM THE 
ROSETTA ION COMPOSITION ANALYZER

Closing date for applications is March 29, 2019.

The Solar System Physics and Space Technology research programme at the 
Swedish Institute of Space Physics in Kiruna invites applications for a 
Postdoctoral position in Space Physics, related to the ESA Rosetta 
mission to comet 67P Churyumov-Gerasimenko. Rosetta is the first 
mission to follow a comet for an extended time, from low activity far 
from the sun to high activity around perihelion. The Rosetta mission is 
now in an intensive data analysis phase, following the ending of the 
mission in September 2016. Applications are invited both for a 2-year 
postdoc position and for shorter periods for guest scientists.

The advertised position is a research position for studies of the 
cometary plasma environment and its interaction with the Solar wind 
primarily using ion data from the Ion Composition Analyzer (ICA) on 
board Rosetta but also using data from the other instruments that form 
the Rosetta Plasma Consortium (RPC). Work using numerical models of 
different aspects of the comet plasma environment is also part of the 
data analysis effort.

[NASA] PDS: OPPORTUNITY TO REVIEW NUCLEAR SPECTROSCOPY DATA DICTIONARY

The PDS Small Bodies Node has has developed a Nuclear Spectroscopy data 
dictionary and are making it available for community input during the 
period March 1-15. The initial version of the dictionary is small, 
supporting metadata needed for Dawn GRaND archiving, and will be 
expanded as needed to support future PDS archiving projects.

This will be the opportunity for nuclear spectroscopy researchers to 
give input to the dictionary at an early stage. No prior experience 
with PDS standards is needed. The Nuclear Spectroscopy data 
dictionary and supporting materials are available at 

https://sbn.psi.edu/nucspecreview

We estimate that several hours of effort will be sufficient to produce 
a meaningful review, although interested reviewers may wish to spend 
more time. 

Thank you for your contributions to this project.

EXPLORING PLANETARY CLIMATE: A HISTORY OF SCIENTIFIC DISCOVERY ON 
EARTH, MARS, VENUS, AND TITAN

"Exploring Planetary Climate: A History of Scientific Discovery on 
Earth, Mars, Venus, and Titan" by Ralph Lorenz is a new book (332 pp. 
132 illus. 602 refs.) published by Cambridge University Press. It 
outlines how we learned to understand our own climate in the last few 
centuries and decades, in parallel with discovering the atmospheric 
conditions on other Solar System bodies and exoplanets. The book 
relates exploration of the ends of the Earth, from deep sea cores to 
mountaintops, to telescopic, theoretical, and ultimately in-situ 
investigation of our planetary neighbours.
