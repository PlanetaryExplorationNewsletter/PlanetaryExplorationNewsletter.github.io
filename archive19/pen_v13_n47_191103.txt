[NASA] STAND-ALONE PLANETARY MAJOR EQUIPMENT AND FACILITIES PROPOSALS
NOT SOLICITED THIS YEAR

The Planetary Major Equipment and Facilities (PMEF) program element
normally allows proposals for the purchase or development of new or
upgraded non-flight analytical, computational, telescopic, and other
instrumentation to be used in investigations in Planetary Science
Division (PSD) research programs.

NOTICE: Amended October 31, 2019. Stand-alone proposals for planetary
Major Equipment and Facilities will not be solicited this year.
Schedule and budget constraints delayed the decisions on the 2018 PMEF
proposals and, as a result, the 2019 Stand-alone proposals are not
solicited. It is anticipated that this program element, including
stand-alone proposals will be solicited in ROSES-2020.

Go to:

http://solicitation.nasaprs.com/ROSES2019

and:

https://science.nasa.gov/researchers/sara/grant-solicitations/roses-
2019/

Questions concerning this program element in general or this amendment
in particular may be directed to Jeffrey Grossman at
HQ-PME@mail.nasa.gov.

[NASA] NEW ROSES GRADUATE STUDENT RESEARCH PROGRAM ELEMENT: E.6 FUTURE
INVESTIGATORS IN NASA EARTH AND SPACE SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY (FINESST) 

Through FINESST, the Science Mission Directorate (SMD) solicits
proposals from accredited U.S. universities and other eligible
organizations for graduate student-designed and performed research
projects that contribute to SMD's science, technology and exploration
goals.

Proposals to FINESST are due by February 4, 2020.

An optional pre-proposal teleconference will be December 2, 2019 from
1:00-2:30 p.m. Eastern Time. Call 1-888-324-3185 (U.S.-only Toll Free)
or 1-630-395-0272 (U.S. Toll) and use Participant Passcode: 8018549.
TTY-equipped callers or other types of relay service, call 711 and
provide the same conference call number/passcode.

Email HQ-FINESST@mail.nasa.gov any teleconference agenda suggestions
and questions by November 25, 2019. Afterwards, questions and responses, 
with identifying information removed, will be posted on the NSPIRES page

MARS RECONNAISSANCE ORBITER CRISM MTRDR AND TER RELEASE 13

PDS announces Release 13 of Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter CRISM Targeted
Empirical Data Record (TER) and Map-projected Targeted Reduced Data
Record (MTRDR) products, at:

  http://pds-geosciences.wustl.edu/missions/mro/crism.htm

This release fills in data from October 5, 2007, through August 8, 2008.
TER products are image cubes derived from CRISM hyperspectral targeted
observations, post-processed to standardize the illumination and 
observation geometry and remove atmospheric gas absorptions and 
instrument artifacts. MTRDRs are the same products map-projected using
terrain models of the Martian surface.

The standard route to access released data:

  https://pds.nasa.gov/datasearch/subscription-service/SS-20191030.shtml

To access all PDS Data Releases, please visit the following link:

EGU 2020 SESSION PS3.4 - VOLCANISM AND TECTONISM ACROSS THE SOLAR
SYSTEM

Please consider submitting an abstract to this session.

PS3.4 - Volcanism and Tectonism across the Solar System

Volcanism and tectonism are two of the most ubiquitous processes at
work in the Solar System, shaping substantially the surfaces of worlds
as diverse as the terrestrial planets, main-belt asteroids, and icy
satellites. With orbital data and samples from the lunar surface,
chronology and geochemistry results from the Moon have provided
important sources of knowledge to understand the evolution of small
planetary bodies.

Through a combination of solicited and contributed presentations, this
session will host observational, analytical, theoretical, and analogue
fieldwork research into any aspect of planetary volcanic and tectonic
activity. We welcome submissions that compare landforms and processes
on multiple bodies, geochemical and chronological data from planetary
material, and how lessons from specific studies can be applied to
understanding volcanism and tectonism across the Solar System.

Conveners:
Ernst Hauber, Solmaz Adeli, and Petr Broz

Abstract submission:

Abstract deadline:
15 January 2020, 13:00 CET

Best wishes,

JOB POSTING: LOCKHEED MARTIN SPACE SEEKS A RESEARCH SCIENTIST

Lockheed Martin Space seeks a Research Scientist to join teams that
design, develop, and operate planetary missions and space-science
instrumentation.  The Deep Space Exploration (DSE) directorate of
Lockheed Martin has a long history of providing spacecraft and hardware
solutions for many planetary missions, including missions to the Moon,
Mars, asteroids, comets, and Jupiter. The Advanced Technology Center
(ATC) is the research lab for LM Space, and within the ATC the Space
Science and Instrumentation (SS&I) pursues fundamental space-science
research and the development of prototype flight instruments and
payloads. The successful candidate will play a key technical and
leadership role in Planetary Science as part of these teams. The
position is based in the Lockheed Martin facility in Littleton, CO.

POSTDOCTORAL POSITION IN EARLY MARS GEOCHEMISTRY

The Department of Planetology and Habitability at the Centro de
Astrobiología (CAB) invites applications for one postdoctoral position
to support investigations on the geochemical nature of the early Mars
environments. We are seeking enthusiastic and excellent candidates to
join a planetary science team funded by the European Research Council
(ERC), working with Dr. Alberto Fairen in the Project "MarsFirstWater"
(ERC Consolidator Grant) broadening the efforts of the Project
"icyMARS" (ERC Starting Grant).

Applicants should have a recent Ph.D. in Geochemistry, and a background
in Mars research and Planetary Science.

The position, placed in Madrid, would be for two years, with possible
extension to a third year contingent upon satisfactory performance.
Benefits include working in a young enthusiastic team at the leading
Astrobiology institution in Europe, full social benefits according to
the Spanish social care system, and a very competitive salary.

Applicants should send a letter of interest, a curriculum with a list
of publications, a brief (maximum two pages) statement of research
interests, and a list of three references, no later than December 31
2019, to Alberto Fairen (agfairen@cab.inta-csic.es).

The starting date is negotiable, but should be no later than March 1,
2020.

POST-DOC JOB ANNOUNCEMENT

U.S. Geological Survey - Mendenhall Research Fellowship Program -
Research Opp. #18-27. Evaluating mineral resources on Mars for
exploration and colonization. Closing date: January 6, 2020. GS-12
two-year appointment.  Duty station: Lakewood, Colorado, USA. Areas of
Ph.D.: Geology, planetary geology, imaging spectroscopy, and mineral
spectroscopy or related fields. The Denver Spectroscopy Group is
seeking a postdoctoral fellow to conduct research focused on creating
mineral maps of the Martian surface using orbital imaging spectrometer
and broadband data emphasizing key minerals to pinpoint sites most
favorable for habitat location. A related research topic involves
spectrally mapping relict hydrothermal deposits to answer stubborn
questions about their origin and where to focus future rover efforts to
potentially discover evidence of past life. A research proposal is the
most important part of the application package and will be evaluated by
an expert panel. Applicants are strongly urged to coordinate the
development of their proposal with the USGS research advisor (i.e.,
Gregg Swayze; gswayze@usgs.gov).

PHD STUDENT OPPORTUNITY

We have an opening for a PhD student interested in experimentally
investigating the interaction of volcanic gas and martian surface
materials and assessing the IR spectral signature of the products
beginning Fall 2020. The student will work with Dr. Hanna Nekvasil on
experiments simulating boiling of magma and investigate the nature of
vapor-deposited salts added to martian dust as well as the alteration
of basalt by martian volcanic gas. The student will also work with Dr.
A. Deanne Rogers on assessing the IR spectral signature of the martian
fines altered by volcanic gas and how this signature is modified by
reaction during changes in relative humidity. Interested students
should contact Hanna.Nekvasil@stonybrook.edu. Stony Brook University
has a dynamic planetary science group and a long history of excellence
in experimental igneous petrology. Please pass this message on to any
student you think may be interested.
