SIMON LOCK WINS THE 2019 PELLAS-RYDER AWARD FOR BEST STUDENT PAPER

Simon J. Lock was named the 2019 Pellas-Ryder Awardee for his 
manuscript "The Origin of the Moon within a Terrestrial Synestia", 
published in the Journal of Geophysical Research Planets in 2018. Simon 
was a PhD student at Harvard University, and is now a postdoc at 
California Institute of Technology. This award, which is jointly 
sponsored by the Meteoritical Society and the Planetary Geology 
Division of the Geological Society of America, is awarded to an 
undergraduate or graduate student who is first author of the best 
planetary science paper published in a peer-reviewed scientific journal 
during the year prior to the award. Congratulations, Simon!

SECOND ANNOUNCEMENT OF MERCURY 2020 CONFERENCE

June 2-4, 2020
Orleans, France
 
The forthcoming conference "Mercury 2020: Current and Future Science of 
the Innermost Planet" will focus on all scientific aspects of planet 
Mercury, including both the current state of knowledge and the 
prospects for future endeavors. The conference welcomes and encourages 
participation from the diverse groups of the world-wide Mercury science 
community, covering topics such as Mercury's:

    Deep interior geophysics and planetary evolution,
    Surface geology and composition,
    Exosphere and magnetosphere dynamics,
    Fundamental physics with BepiColombo. 

In addition, the latest plans and developments from BepiColombo's 
unprecedented two-spacecraft exploration of Mercury will be shared and 
discussed.

The number of participants being limited to 120, early registration 
and abstract submission are warmly suggested.

Detailed information about this meeting can be found at: 

https://mercury2020.ias.u-psud.fr/
