[NASA] DELAY OF DUE DATE FOR SOLAR SYSTEM WORKINGS

Because of the Government shutdown, the proposal due date for C.3 Solar
System Workings has been changed from January 31, 2019 to TBD. A new
due date will be set for this program, and announced later.

It is expected that some additional time will be provided because there
are proposers who have been unable to work because of the shutdown.
Please note that the due date shown in NSPIRES is NOT a  proposal due
date; the system requires a specific date be used rather than "TBD".

[NASA] FINESST: DELAY OF PROPOSAL DUE DATE

Because of the government shutdown, the proposal due date for Future
Investigators in NASA Earth and Space Science and Technology(FINESST)
has been changed from February 1, 2019 to TBD. A new due date will be
set for this program after the government returns. It is expected that
some additional time will be provided because there are  proposers who
have been unable to work because of the shutdown. Please note that the
due date shown in NSPIRES is NOT a proposal due date; the system

LUNAR ISRU WORKSHOP DELAYED 

Despite the recent announcement of a temporary funding measure to open
the government, there is no guarantee that this will become permanent.
This situation has had a debilitating effect on our Lunar ISRU
Workshop, not only in terms of getting NASA participation, but also
support from USRA. At this time, we have no choice but to postpone the
workshop. If your presentation has been accepted, it will remain so.

AOGS SESSION PS02: PLASMA - SURFACE INTERACTIONS WITH AIRLESS BODIES IN
THE SOLAR SYSTEM

We would kindly like to bring to your attention our session entitled
"Plasma - Surface Interactions with Airless Bodies in the Solar
System", organized at the 2019 Asia Oceania Geosciences Society (AOGS)
meeting, held from 28 July to 2 August in Singapore.

In this session we invite contributions that will move forward our
understanding of fundamental plasma-surface interaction mechanisms with
airless bodies in our Solar System. Investigations that explore key
challenges by exploiting the synergies between in-situ observations,
simulations models and laboratory experiments to characterize the
fundamental physical processes determining the global and local
near-surface plasma environments are especially welcomed. 

Full session details here:

https://www.meetmatt-svr.net/Public/SessionDetailsPartial?id=13

With many successful missions to airless bodies recently completed,
currently active, and in preparation, and with both simulation models
and laboratory experiments resolving the finer details of plasma
interactions better each year, this will surely be an exciting session!

Feel free to spread this announcement. Before February 12, submit your 
abstract here:

http://www.asiaoceania.org/aogs2019/public.asp?page=abstract.htm

Thank you, we look forward to seeing you in Singapore!

AOGS SESSION ST08: MAGNETIC FLUX ROPE THROUGHOUT THE SOLAR SYSTEM
 
At the AOGS 2019 conference held in Singapore 28 July - 2 August 2019,
we will convene a session titled: "ST-08 Magnetic Flux Rope Throughout
the Solar System".

We invite abstracts that address a wide range of topics on the
fundamental physics of magnetic flux ropes from the solar atmosphere to
the magnetospheres of Earth and planets (inner and outer planets,
including Venus and Mars) using spacecraft observations, theoretical
analysis, and numerical simulations. Magnetic flux rope is one of the
most fundamental magnetic structures in space plasma physics and are
ubiquitous in the solar system. They can exist in a wide range of
spatial scales, from tens-of-million km coronal mass ejection in
interplanetary space, to tens-of-thousands km flux transfer events and
plasmoid-type flux ropes in global/induced planetary magnetospheres,
down to the electron inertial scale length magnetic islands forming
during the early stages of reconnection in thin current sheets. Despite
having been extensively studied using classical plasma theory,
numerical simulations and observations, many aspects of magnetic flux
ropes remain unexplored, primarily their origins, dynamics (e.g.
plasmoid instability) and their effects on field-aligned current
generation, energetic particle acceleration and thermal plasma
transport.

FULLY-FUNDED PHD ON SURFACE WIND MODELLING ON MARS

Research team based in UK and co-supervised by researchers in CalTech
and SETI. Mars has widespread deposits of sand-sized sediments forming
significant wind-blown dune fields of various typologies and scales.
Understanding the dynamics of surface atmospheric boundary layers is
therefore paramount in examining Mars' landform dynamics.

Most research efforts have focussed on Mars atmospheric circulation at
very large scales using Global Climate Models (GCMs). Temporal and
spatial scales of these models are good first principles in
understanding atmospheric-surface interactions, but are much too coarse
when trying to understand surface landform dynamics. 

Recent efforts have employed
microscale computational fluid dynamics modelling to investigate
atmospheric surface interactions and dune surface changes. Several
state-of-the-art numerical atmospheric modelling tools will be used,
including a Mars GCM, a regional Mars mesoscale climate model, and a
computational fluid dynamics model (OpenFOAM). Geospatial and
geomorphic analysis of relevant spacecraft imagery and other
observational data will be used to constrain and validate the modelling
results. 

Overall objective: to combine macro- to meso- to micro-scale
airflow modelling for a more realistic modelling of meter-scale airflow
involved in the time-evolution of aeolian features on Mars.
