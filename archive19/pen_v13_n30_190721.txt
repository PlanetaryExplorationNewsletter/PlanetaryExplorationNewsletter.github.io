AGU SESSION P028: PLANETARY ATMOSPHERES AND EVOLUTION

Understanding the nature and variability of (exo)planetary atmospheres,
the physical mechanisms governing these atmospheres, and their chemical
evolution are strong driving forces of planetary science and Solar
System exploration mission planning. While the long-term evolution of
the Earth is constrained by geological studies and isotopic analyses,
the evolutionary paths of other planets must be reconstructed from data
obtained through astronomical observations and planetary missions.
Models of planetary atmospheres use these observations to highlight
governing physical processes operating from the Earth to other planets
in our Solar System and beyond. The rapidly increasing number of
discovered exoplanets provides a new opportunity for interdisciplinary
collaborations between heliophysicists, astrophysicists, geoscientists,
biochemists, planetary and climate scientists concerning the physical
and chemical evolution of (exo)planetary atmospheres and planetary
habitability.

This session welcomes observational, theoretical, experimental, and
field studies relevant to the atmospheres, evolution, and habitability
of planets in and outside of our Solar System.

AGU SESSION P022: MACHINE LEARNING FOR PLANETARY SCIENCE

Machine Learning (ML) is the subfield of computer science
that gives "computers the ability to learn without being explicitly
programmed." As increasingly large, complex datasets are acquired,
autonomy and machine intelligence will have a critical role in the
interpretation of data from planetary exploration missions. There is a
need for frameworks that can rapidly and intelligently extract
information from these datasets in a manner useful for scientific
analysis. This session will explore research that leverages machine
learning methods to enhance our scientific understanding of planetary
data and to increase the scientific return from exploration missions.
This session will also explore ways of introducing machine learning
into existing analysis workflows. Topics may encompass data analysis on
the ground (post-downlink) as well as onboard a spacecraft for existing
or future planetary exploration missions and instruments.

AGU SESSION P017: ICE FROM GRAINS TO LANDSCAPES: SURFACE PROCESSES ON
ACTIVE ICY WORLDS

We would like to invite submissions to our Icy Worlds AGU session this
fall in San Francisco.

As we consider the in situ exploration of outer Solar System worlds -
such as icy satellites, small bodies, and Kuiper Belt objects -
increasing collaboration between those who study surface processes on
landscape scales and those who study processes at the scale of a landed
robotic vehicle will continue to increase in importance. To gather
these different scientific communities together, we invite
contributions ranging in focus from comparative planetology and remote
sensing, to laboratory analogs, instrumentation and experiments, to
theoretical and numerical modeling. We intend for this session to
foster more collaboration between these communities, so that we may
continue to explore the commonality of surface processes on icy worlds,
despite their dispersion across the Solar System.

AGU SPECIAL SESSION A117: SOUNDS OF THE SOLAR SYSTEM: GEOPHYSICAL AND
PLANETARY ACOUSTICS

Forces imposed on the atmosphere of Earth and other planets can create
acoustic waves that travel vast distances, providing information
on their source and the transmission medium. On Earth, low frequency
sound ("infrasound") sensors can capture signals from natural sources
(volcanoes, earthquakes, severe storms, bolides, etc.) and human
activities (chemical and nuclear explosions, supersonic aircraft, wind
turbines, dams, etc.). These sounds can be inverted to determine
atmospheric structure. They may also carry energy into the upper
atmosphere, creating localized heating. The recent detection of Martian
infrasound via the InSight lander has highlighted the scientific
dividends of acoustic monitoring on other Solar System bodies as well.
In fact, studies of acoustic wave propagation have been performed for
Venus, Jupiter, and Titan; there is an increasing recognition that
sound waves can provide details on a variety of phenomena that cannot
be captured from orbit. This session is dedicated to highlighting
studies of acoustic waves on the Earth and beyond. We invite 
theoretical, numerical, and experimental studies in geophysical and
planetary acoustics.

AGU SESSION P019: INFRARED SPECTROSCOPY FOR SURFACE COMPOSITIONS
ACROSS THE SOLAR SYSTEM

This session seeks to bring together infrared spectroscopists studying
the surface composition of the terrestrial planets, the small bodies,
icy moons and beyond, in either short-wave IR, long-wave IR, or both.
Submissions are encouraged from either telescopic or spacecraft
spectroscopy that highlight new results. Additionally, in celebration
of AGU's centennial, we also encourage submissions on the history and
evolution of our understanding of surface compositions as spectroscopic
techniques have improved or as we have achieved increased spatial
resolution with spacecraft flybys, orbiters and landers. Submissions on
spectroscopy from laboratory studies, extraterrestrial materials, and
Earth analogs are also welcome.

AGU SESSION EP036: SHAPING LANDSCAPES OF THE SOLAR SYSTEM -
ENVIRONMENTAL FLOWS ON OTHER PLANETS

Quantitative models for surface processes have been derived for Earth
systems. When applied to other planetary bodies, these Earth-based
models can provide critical insights into the geologic history of the
Solar System. In return, planetary surfaces across the Solar System
offer a unique opportunity to test these models under conditions often
unachievable on Earth. We invite a range of contributions in the field
of planetary surface processes with an emphasis on fluid and granular
flows (fluvial, eolian, glacial, mass wasting, coastal, etc.) and that
use laboratory experiments, theoretical and numerical modeling, and
planetary-exploration data from orbiters, landers, and rovers. This
session's goal is to explore the interplay between quantitative models
for planetary surface processes and new planetary exploration data that
often challenge these models. We intend this session to foster more
collaboration between members of the PS and EPSP sections.

AGU SESSION P004: BEYOND THE CATASTROPHE - THE BIOLOGICAL AND
ASTROBIOLOGICAL SIGNIFICANCE OF IMPACT CRATERING IN THE SOLAR SYSTEM

Meteorite impact events are unique, ubiquitous, and significant
geological processes on every rocky and icy body in the Solar System.
Impact events on the early Earth undoubtedly had profound effects on
early life, if not the origin of life. The effects of shock
metamorphism combined with the generation of post-impact hydrothermal
systems in the presence of adequate water make impact environments
attractive astrobiology targets. This session will discuss the
beneficial biological consequences and astrobiological implications of
meteorite impact events and impact craters: including habitat
modification, generation of subsurface habitability, biosignature
preservation, microbial metabolic implications and planetary
exploration targets.

AGU SESSION P029: PLANETARY ATMOSPHERIC, SURFACE, AND INTERIOR SCIENCE
USING RADIO AND LASER LINKS

Solar System exploration has been advanced over the past five decades
via Radio Science techniques to study planetary and solar phenomena as
well as fundamental physics. The scope of this session includes
investigations within the Solar System as well as tests of fundamental
physics to expand the frontiers of Solar System exploration using radio
and optical science to address the study of ocean worlds, planetary and
small body interiors, the dynamics, composition, and thermal structure
of planetary atmospheres, characterizing the scattering, electrical,
and other properties of planetary surfaces, and research in fundamental
physics and Solar System dynamics. Relevant technology topics include
the design of small spacecraft networks and constellations, advances in
flight and ground instrumentation, advances in space clock
technologies, novel communications architectures including optical
links, advances in radio and laser technologies, and new techniques and
instrumentation for entry probe radio science.

The submission deadline is Wednesday, 31 July 2019.

AGU SESSION P007: COMPARATIVE PLANETOLOGY: LARGE PLANETESIMALS AND
DWARF PLANETS THROUGHOUT THE SOLAR SYSTEM

Observations returned by space missions (e.g., Dawn, New Horizons,
Cassini) and large Earth-bound telescopic surveys (e.g., NEOWISE,
Adaptive optics observations) over the past decade offer a broad
encompassing view of the population of large planetesimals and dwarf
planets that formed shortly after Solar System formation. Most of these
bodies have retained information on their accretional environments
while others have undergone significant internal evolution.

The Psyche and Lucy missions now prepare to continue deciphering the
Solar System's early history with the exploration of 16 Psyche and
Jupiter's Trojan asteroids, while instruments on the extremely large
telescopes available in the next decade will provide observations with
unprecedented details of many large planetesimals.

This session welcomes abstracts that address new observations and
models of large planetesimals found across the Solar System, compare
and contrast the properties of planetesimals found in various small
body reservoirs, and address their possible genetic relationships.

Abstract deadline: July 31

[NASA] SIMPLEX (PEA-J OF SALMON-3) CLOSED, 2020 SOLICITATION
ANTICIPATED

In 2018 NASA solicited PEA J of SALMON-3 NASA solicited and received
proposals for Small Innovative Missions for Planetary Exploration
(SIMPLEx): investigations in which a secondary payload small spacecraft
is built and deployed from a primary spacecraft mission, for
acquisition of science data, analysis, publication of scientific
results, and delivery of the data to an appropriate NASA archive.

PEA J of SALMON-3 was presented as an open call, allowing for proposals
to be submitted at any time. However, it is now closed. It is
anticipated that another SIMPLEx opportunity will be solicited in 2020.
When the next SIMPLEx opportunity is released, it will have a new
(letter) designation. It is anticipated that the next SIMPLEx proposal
due date will be no earlier than June 2020 and no fewer than 90 days
after release of the text. New flight opportunities, consistent with
the due date, will be identified at the time of release. Lessons
learned may result in minor changes to the solicitation.

Questions regarding SIMPLEx may be addressed to Ms. Doris Daou at
Doris.Daou@nasa.gov.
