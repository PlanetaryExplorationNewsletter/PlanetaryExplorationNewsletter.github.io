AGU SESSION P041: ULTRAVIOLET OBSERVING OF SOLAR SYSTEM TARGETS

We are pleased to invite abstract submissions for this session at the 
2019 AGU Fall Meeting in San Francisco, CA, December 9-13, 2019.

Ultraviolet spectroscopy and imaging have a decades-long history as 
valuable techniques for studying atmospheres, aurorae, plumes, and 
surface composition and volatiles on asteroids, comet nuclei and moons. 
While there continue to be opportunities for UV remote sensing from 
Earth orbit and in future robotic missions, the infrastructure for UV 
instrumentation is at a crossroads. Existing orbital facilities are 
nearing the end of their useful lives and there continue to be many 
phenomena that cannot be effectively studied with existing, 
high-heritage instrument designs. Exciting advances in UV-optimized 
technologies promise new capabilities that can be incorporated into the 
next generation of robotic probes, flexible SmallSat missions, and 
large aperture space-based observatories. This session welcomes 
abstracts covering UV science results, as well as reports on progress 
toward developing new technologies such as UV detector technologies, 
high performance coatings, and novel sensor designs.

Deadline for abstract submissions: Wednesday, 31 July, 23:59 EDT

Conveners Shouleh Nikzad (JPL), Amanda Hendrix (PSI), Walt Harris 
(Univ. Arizona)

AGU SESSION V045: SOME LIKE IT WET! ACTIVE AND ANCIENT HYDROTHERMAL
PROCESSES ON EARTH AND BEYOND

Fluid-rock interactions in the oceanic lithosphere are of fundamental 
importance in regulating mass and heat exchange in numerous geologic 
processes, with strong implications for 1) the evolution of life on 
Earth and possibly elsewhere in the Solar System, 2) the dynamics of 
plate tectonics and metamorphism, 3) climate change through feedback 
between atmosphere, hydrosphere, and lithosphere, and 4) the formation 
of economic mineral deposits and hydrocarbons. This session aims to 
provide a forum for anyone studying the mechanisms, effects, and 
implications of fluid-rock interactions and metamorphic processes in 
the oceanic lithosphere, including active systems and their ancient 
analogues preserved in the rock record. We welcome contributions 
relevant to terrestrial and extraterrestrial settings where liquid 
water is or once was present including planets, icy moons, and 
meteorite parent bodies. Field studies, laboratory experiments, 
numerical models, and remote sensing studies that further our 
understanding of fluid-rock interactions, metasomatic, and metamorphic 
processes are welcome.

AGU SESSION P024: MERCURY - THE CONTINUING AND FUTURE EXPLORATION OF 
THE INNERMOST PLANET

With three days to the deadline, we remind folks of a Mercury session 
at the 2019 AGU Fall Meeting in San Francisco, CA, December 9-13, 2019.

NASA's MESSENGER mission revolutionized our understanding of Mercury's 
surface, interior, exosphere, and magnetosphere. With the successful 
launch of the ESA-JAXA BepiColombo dual spacecraft mission to Mercury 
in October 2018, that understanding will soon take another substantial 
step forward. In this session, we welcome papers on data analysis, 
laboratory measurements, ground-based observations, and theoretical 
developments that build on the current state of knowledge of Mercury, 
as well as contributions on Mercury-like exoplanets. We particularly 
welcome papers on how questions raised by MESSENGER findings can be 
addressed by future observations expected from BepiColombo.

Arya Udry (University of Nevada Las Vegas) and Hannah Susorney 
(The University of British Columbia) will give invited presentations.

Please consider submitting an abstract for this session. For more 
information, visit:

AGU SESSION P032: RETURNING TO THE MOON - THE SCIENCE OF EXPLORATION

We are pleased to invite you to submit an abstract for the following 
session at the 2019 AGU Fall Meeting in San Francisco, CA, 
December 9-13, 2019.

The session will focus on how the close collaboration between science, 
technology and exploration will enable deeper understanding of the 
Moon and other airless bodies as we move further out of low-Earth 
orbit. The Solar System Exploration Research Virtual Institute 
(SSERVI) will focus on the scientific aspects of exploration as they 
pertain to the Moon, Near Earth Asteroids (NEAs) and the moons of Mars.
This session will feature interdisciplinary, exploration-related 
science centered around all airless bodies targeted as potential human 
destinations. Areas of study reported here will represent the broad 
spectrum of lunar, NEA, and Martian moon sciences encompassing 
investigations of the surface, interior, exosphere, and near-space 
environments as well as science uniquely enabled from these bodies.
Graduate students and early career researchers are particularly 
encouraged to submit for oral presentations.

EARLY CAREER PARTICIPANT SUPPORT AVAILABLE FOR OPAG MEETING, 
AUGUST 19-21

NASA's Outer Planets Assessment Group will provide travel grants for a
limited number of interested Early Career participants to attend the 
OPAG meeting August 20-21 in Boulder, CO. OPAG plays a key role in 
sculpting the planetary science community's input into NASA activities 
for outer planets science and exploration. Thus it is critical for 
Early Career scientists to attend these meetings both to learn how NASA 
and Planetary Science programs operate and to represent the community 
that will work on OPAG-relevant projects in the coming decade. In 
addition to the OPAG meeting, Early Career travel awardees can also 
participate in the OPAG Subsurface Needs for Ocean Worlds Meeting 
(SNOW) on August 19 prior to OPAG. Selected individuals will present 
a poster at the meeting on a topic of their choosing. Interested 
graduate students, postdocs, and other Early Career scientists (within 
5 years of PhD/MS/BS) should submit a one-page letter of interest and 
a CV to morgan.l.cable "at" jpl.nasa.gov by August 1, 2019. Recipients 
will be notified by August 5, and will receive support for hotel and 
transportation costs. For more information, email Morgan Cable at the 
address above.

OPAG SUBSURFACE NEEDS FOR OCEAN WORLDS (SNOW) MEETING #1

Accessing into and through the ice shells of ocean worlds will both 
enable compelling science, including the search for evidence of past 
and present life, and require dedicated technology programs to realize.
OPAG invites members of the astrobiology, planetary science, ocean 
science and technology communities to join together in a 
community-based forum aimed at defining the path to the ocean(s). The 
first Subsurface Needs for Ocean Worlds meeting will be held 9am-5pm 
August 19, 2019, immediately prior to the fall OPAG meeting in Boulder, 
CO. This 1-day workshop is designed to be an open forum to discuss 
technology needs, common science drivers, and mission architectures for 
Ocean Worlds exploration. The agenda will include a mixture of short 
presentations, break out groups, and lighting talks on technology and 
science. 

SNOW meeting #1 will seek to develop plans for Decadal Survey white 
paper(s) and define action items and agenda for the next meeting 
(prior to the winter/spring OPAG meeting). Early career scientists are 
encouraged to participate. Travel support for the OPAG meeting, can be 
extended to attend SNOW.

CELEBRATING THE WOMEN OF APOLLO

Splashdown! July 24th marked the 50th anniversary of the return of 
Apollo 11 astronauts Neil Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin, and Michael Collins, 
after a historic mission that saw Neil and Buzz on the lunar surface 
for about 2.5 hours. In mid-1969, there were about 100 women, including 
16 engineers, serving in top positions at the Kennedy Space Center in 
Florida. But thousands of other women around the country also supported 
the Apollo program, before, during, and after 1969. Many of them have 
recently been interviewed as part of the 50th anniversary, and their 
stories have appeared in various news outlets. For easy reference, we 
list many here. If you find even more (and we hope you do!), please let 
us know in the comments section. As we go forward to the Moon with 
Artemis, including the first women landing on the lunar surface by 2024 
and onward to Mars, women around the world will continue to leave 
indelible marks on the Moon and throughout the Solar System.
