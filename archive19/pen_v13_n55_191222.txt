CONGRATULATIONS PIERAZZO INTERNATIONAL STUDENT TRAVEL AWARD WINNERS

The Pierazzo International Student Travel Award was established by PSI 
in memory of Senior Scientist Betty Pierazzo to support and encourage 
graduate students to build international collaborations and 
relationships in planetary science. 

Malena Rice of Yale University will receive the 2020 award for a 
U.S.-based graduate student traveling to a planetary meeting outside 
the U.S. Her research is titled "Probing the Solar System with the 
Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS)", to be presented at the 
Expanding the Science of TESS Workshop in Sydney, Australia, 
February 10-14, 2020. 

Lucy Kissick of Oxford University will receive the 2020 award for a 
non-U.S.-based graduate traveling to a planetary meeting within the 
U.S. Her research title is "The Sedimentary Archive of Atmospheric CO2 
on Mars" and she will be attending the 51st Lunar and Planetary Science 
Conference in The Woodlands, Texas, March 16-20, 2020. She is also 
recognized for her work developing a mission concept with ESA, 
"Sample Return from a Relic Ocean World: the Calathus Mission to 
Occator Crater, Ceres," which will also be presented.

A PSI representative will present each awardee with a certificate and 
check for $2,000 at their respective conferences.

EGU 2020 SESSION GM11.1/PS4: PLANETARY GEOMORPHOLOGY

The deadline (January 15, 2020, 13:00 CET) for abstract submission to 
EGU 2020 is fast approaching.

Please consider submitting an abstract to the session on Planetary 
Geomorphology (GM11.1/PS4).

The Planetary Geomorphology session aims to bring together 
geomorphologists who study the Earth with those who work on other 
bodies such as Mars, Venus, Mercury, the Moon, icy satellites of the 
outer solar system, comets, and/or asteroids. Studies applicable to 
landscapes on any scale on any solid body are welcome. We particularly 
encourage those who use Earth analogues or laboratory/numerical 
simulation to submit their work. Considered processes could include 
aeolian, volcanic, tectonic, fluvial, glacial, periglacial, or 
"undetermined" ones. We especially welcome contributions from 
early-career scientists and geomorphologists who are new to planetary 
science.

The session will include an invited presentation from Michelle Koutnik 
on the topic of ice preservation and landscape erosion during glacial 
retreat on Earth and Mars.

EGU 2020 SESSION GM2.2: LANDFORM MAPPING - RECENT ADVANCES IN DATA 
COLLECTION AND MAPPING APPROACHES

The deadline of January 15, 2020, 13:00 CET, for abstract submission 
to EGU 2020 is fast approaching. 

Please consider submitting an abstract to this PICO session, which 
this year has expanded its scope to include the theme of planetary 
mapping, including landing site characterisation for planetary lander 
and rover missions.

This session aims to showcase recent advances in landform mapping, and 
we invite contributions related to mapping of specific landforms as 
well as whole landsystems in different environments and on other 
planetary bodies. We particularly welcome studies that (a) demonstrate 
the potential of multi-method and innovative mapping approaches, (b) 
showcase novel methods of data collection to solve 
previously-overlooked problems, or (c) present mapping of 
previously-unmapped or newly-emerging landscapes.

An introductory keynote will be given by Mark Johnson (University of 
Gothenburg) on 'The LiDAR revolution in glacial geomorphology: Its 
gifts and challenges'.

Conveners:

Benjamin Chandler, Frances Butcher, Marek Ewertowski, Ramon Pellitero 
Ondicol, and Aleksandra Tomczyk

EGU 2020 SESSION: FLUIDS AND MELTS AT EXTREME CONDITIONS

Abstract submission is open for EGU 2020, held in Vienna from May 3-8.

The deadline for the abstract submission is January 15, 2020, 
13:00 CET.

The objective of this session is to bring together researchers 
interested in understanding fluids and melts at ultra high temperatures
and/or ultra high pressures. We encourage contributions that address 
the thermodynamics, dynamics and chemistry of fluids and melts relevant 
to planetary accretion, differentiation and evolution. Abstracts that 
cross disciplines or involve multiple methodologies (experiments, 
calculations, etc.) are especially encouraged.

Convenors: Antonio Manjon-Cabeza Cordoba (ETHZ), Dan J. Bower 
(Uni Bern), Natalia Solomatova (ENS Lyon)

BAHFEST SCIENCE-THEMED COMEDY EVENT LOOKING FOR SUBMISSIONS

The Festival of Bad Ad Hoc Hypotheses (BAHFest) is a celebration of 
well-argued and thoroughly researched but completely incorrect 
scientific theory. Brave speakers present their bad theories in front 
of a live audience and a panel of judges with real science 
credentials, who together determine who takes home the coveted BAHFest 
trophy.

BAHFest 2020 takes place at Rice University in Houston on March 8th 
and will host Phil Plait, the Bad Astronomer, as the keynote speaker. 
BAHFest is looking for submissions from the space community. They are 
looking for short (3-5 minute) funny original presentations in which 
the speaker gives a fake scientific lecture. The lecture can be on any 
scientific topic, and generally are about scientific theories, 
proposals for experiments, or proposals for large science or 
technology projects.

Learn more at the BAHFest website, and sign up until January 15th!

PROCESSING OF AMINO ACIDS FROM ICE RADIATION EXPERIMENTS AT GSFC/NASA

The Cosmic Ice Lab at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center (Greenbelt, MD) 
is seeking candidates for a postdoc position in the field of 
astrochemistry. This research will involve a systematic study of the 
formation of prebiotic molecules through a combination of experimental 
ice radiation and aqueous chemistry. The successful candidate will 
perform high-vacuum ice irradiation experiments, aqueous chemistry in 
high pressure reaction cells, and will analyze the results using 
liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry.

This research will focus on organic compounds of astrobiological 
interest formed by ice radiation chemistry. Additionally, it will 
examine the role of hydrothermal processing in modifying these 
organics, comparing the findings to organic materials previously 
detected in extraterrestrial samples (e.g., meteorites).

The applicants should have a PhD in chemistry or a related field at 
the start of the position and must be within five years of the receipt 
of their doctoral degree. Ideally, candidates will have experience 
with some or all of the following: cryo-vacuum apparatus, radiation 
chemistry, infrared spectroscopy, ultrahigh-performance liquid 
chromatography with UV fluorescence and time of flight mass 
spectrometry detection (LC-FD/ToF-MS) , high-pressure reaction cells.

OPAG POSTER SESSION

The next Outer Planets Assessment Group (OPAG) meeting will be held on 
February 3-4, 2020 at the Lunar and Planetary Institute (LPI) in 
Houston, TX. OPAG will host a poster session the on Monday, February 3, 
for technology and mission concepts/studies. Posters should focus on 
ICEE-2 and similar Icy World in situ instruments and sampling systems. 
Posters that focus on science investigations will also be accommodated 
if space is available. If you wish to present a poster at OPAG, please 
send the title and first author to Morgan Cable, 
Morgan.L.Cable@jpl.nasa.gov, by February 1. Please include 'OPAG Poster 
Presentation' in the subject line. After the meeting, the presenters 
will be invited to electronically submit an abstract and the poster 
file to be archived on the OPAG website. Please note that a previous 
announcement prematurely sent an abstract submission link without 
clarifying that an abstract submission does not constitute an intent to 
present at the OPAG meeting.

Poster presentations are limited and will be awarded on a first-come, 
first-served basis. Poster dimensions should be 44" x 44" maximum. 
Poster presenters can advertise their poster with a single powerpoint 
slide in a lightning session immediately prior to the poster session.
