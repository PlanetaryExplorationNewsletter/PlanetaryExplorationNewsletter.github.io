EPSC/DPS WORKSHOP: SOLAR SYSTEM GEOMETRY WITH SPICE

Please join us for a SPICE Training session on Wednesday, Sept 18,
13:30-17:00 Pluto (room 13) 

SPICE is an information system that uses ancillary data to provide
Solar System geometry information to scientists and engineers in order
to plan and analyze sientific observations. The ESA SPICE Service
offers a training session on SPICE aimed to those who want to be
introduced to SPICE or who might be considering attending a complete
SPICE Training.

During this course a brief introduction to SPICE will be provided and
it will be followed by a practical hands-on lesson of a SPICE
application based on a remote sensing observation scenario. We will
also go through WebGeocalc, SPICE-Enhanced Cosmographia 3D
Visualization Software and some Python packages.

Training material will be provided with GitHub, using the ESS account:

other agencies to support missions to planetary objects across the
Solar System. If you are looking for a rewarding position in the
Federal workforce and have expertise in photogrammetry and software
development, we need your help! Job duties include developing software,
algorithms, and/or guidelines for mapping planetary data; developing
planetary sensor models that define the transformation between image
space and object space; producing improved geospatial knowledge of
extraterrestrial bodies and planetary datasets (e.g., spacecraft
ephemerides, digital elevation models, orthorectified images and
mosaics, metadata, and control networks); and providing guidance to
technical staff working on photogrammetric and geodetic production
tasks. Applicants must have a bachelors or higher degree in physical
science, engineering, or mathematics, expertise in the concepts,
theories, and principles of photogrammetry, cartography, geodesy,
and/or computer vision, and experience developing and modifying
software to apply these principles to highly varied datasets.
Applicants must be US citizens, and a background check is required.
This position is located in Flagstaff, AZ. Apply starting September 2,
2019 through USAjobs.gov announcement DEN-2019-0254:

OPPORTUNITY TO HOST CITIZEN SCIENCE WORKSHOP
 
Following last year's "Building the NASA Citizen Science Community"
workshop, where scientists, students, outside experts, and thought
leaders explored how NASA can help build a Nation of citizen
scientists, NASA's Science Mission Directorate (SMD) has received
inquiries about proposals to host a summer 2020 workshop. SMD will
consider proposals for a summer 2020 citizen science workshop via the
ROSES-19 TWSC program element if they are received by October 25, 2019.

Note, this is earlier than the posted TWSC deadline listed on NSPIRES.
Proposals must identify Marc Kuchner (Marc.Kuchner@nasa.gov) as the
point of contact. One grant of approximately $90K - 125K to one U.S.
led team is expected in early 2020.

ACADEMIC POSITION IN EXOPLANET CHARACTERISATION AT CARDIFF UNIVERSITY

Closing date: Thursday 7 November 2019

Cardiff University job reference: 9049BR

The School of Physics and Astronomy at Cardiff University has
one of the largest astronomy groups in the UK with 26 academic
staff in astronomy-related activities including galactic
and extragalactic astrophysics, ground-based and space-borne
instrumentation development, and gravitational waves. We have
an immediate vacancy for an open-ended academic position, at
Lecturer, Senior Lecturer, or Reader level, in the field of
exoplanet science. The appointment will be made at a level
commensurate with experience.

This position is part of a long-term strategic plan for astronomy
at Cardiff to broaden current research to exoplanet science using
space and ground based facilities. We are part of the international
consortium that will provide the science payload for the European
Space Agency's ARIEL satellite, dedicated to the systematic
characterisation of exoplanet atmospheres and scheduled for launch
in 2028. It is expected that the new appointee will become a key
member of the Cardiff ARIEL team and of the international ARIEL
consortium.

SHARED FOLDER AND SPREADSHEET FOR PRE-DECADAL MERCURY WHITE PAPERS

Dear Mercury community,

With the Decadal Survey scheduled to begin next year, efforts are now
underway to draft white papers to support the Survey and identify key
issues for consideration.

To support the writing of, and collaboration on, Mercury-focused white
papers we have prepared a spreadsheet for use by the community where
the details of these papers can be collated. This spreadsheet is within
a shared Google Drive folder where the paper drafts themselves can be
shared for community feedback.

The folder and spreadsheet can be accessed via:

https://drive.google.com/open?id=1-cLXg9sPfKbWl1sg08G3c0RBArekDnrw

Please direct any queries or problems with accessing the
folder/spreadsheet to Paul Byrne (paul.byrne@ncsu.edu).

With thanks,

Dave Blewett
