CITIZEN SCIENCE PARTNERSHIP OFFERED BY COSMOQUEST AT PSI

The CosmoQuest team (cosmoquest.org) is available to partner on ROSES 
and NSF proposals with citizen science components. Our platform was 
the first to achieve surface science results from the general public 
that are comparable to those of professionals (Robbins, et al. 2014), 
and today we are working with the OSIRIS-REx team to provide internal 
mapping solutions that will grow into public citizen science projects 
in later mission stages. Our software has a python backbone that 
allows your custom code to be integrated to create a seamless data 
reduction pipeline where people are part of the process.

CosmoQuest works with a tight-knit community of adults who are 
long-term participants that you can come to know (or leave community 
engagement to us). In addition to our citizen science tools, we also 
provide our community online seminars, news shows, and other content 
through new media platforms like Twitch.tv, YouTube, and Discord. 
Your volunteers will both learn and do science! In January 2019, 
CosmoQuest became part of the Planetary Science Institute. Our admin 
team is ready to help professionally and accurately process grants. 
Contact project director Pamela Gay, plg@psi.edu, to learn more.

EPSC-DPS SPECIAL SESSION: INTERSTELLAR PROBE 

An Interstellar Probe mission has been discussed since 1960 and studied 
by multiple groups since then. A new NASA-funded trade study is under 
way to design a mission concept using available or near-term 
technology. Cross-disciplinary science targets include exploration of 
the Very Local Interstellar Medium and its interaction with the 
heliosphere, characterization of the circum-solar dust disk, 
exploration of previously unexplored Kuiper Belt Objects, and 
observation of the extragalactic background light beyond the zodiacal 
cloud. A vantage point far away from the Solar System, naturally 
enables these observations to be put in the context of other 
exoplanetary systems and astrospheres. At the same time, Chinese 
scientists are studying with their space agency CNSA a scenario in 
which two "Heliospheric Boundary Explorers". Not only will the 
synergies between these two missions be particularly valuable, but 
also both of them will offer unique opportunities for broad 
international collaborations, including European contributions. This 
session will welcome reports on the unique science discoveries enabled 
by missions to the Interstellar Medium beyond heliospheric boundaries.

The International Conference on Lunar and Deep Space Exploration 
(LDSE)  is a bi-annual event jointly organized by China National 
Space Administration (CNSA) and Chinese Academy of Sciences. With the 
rapid development of lunar and deep space exploration in China in the 
recent decades, this conference is becoming a major forum in China to 
discuss ideas and scientific results in planetary exploration. The 
topics cover all areas in planetary research and road maps, with the 
focus on exploration missions and related data analysis, ground 
observations, laboratory experiments, and theoretical work.

The Mars Science and Exploration Sessions include the following 
themes:

- Geology and Geophysics
- Atmospheres
- Martian Meteorites
- Mars Analog Studies
- Mars Exploration: Past, Present and Future

Updates on the status of China's Mars Global Remote Sensing Orbiter, 
Lander and Rover to be launched in 2020, together carrying 12 
scientific instruments, will be presented.

Convenor: Prof. Long Xiao

Your suggestions are welcomed!
