POSTDOCTORAL RESEARCH OPPORTUNITY IN ORGANIC AND INORGANIC GEOCHEMISTRY 
AT THE NASA JOHNSON SPACE CENTER

The Lunar and Planetary Institute (LPI) in Houston, Texas, part of the 
Universities Space Research Association, invites applications for a 
postdoctoral researcher to conduct NASA-supported work in research at 
the interface of organic and inorganic geochemistry: 

https://usra-openhire.silkroad.com/epostings/index.cfm?fuseaction
=app.jobInfo&version=1&jobid=920

The successful candidate should have expertise in the analysis of 
organic molecules and their inorganic host phases for multiple research 
projects and will work with Drs. Eve Berger and Aaron Burton on two 
projects. Project one involves characterizing changes in organic and 
mineralogical composition of organic-bearing asteroidal and cometary 
simulant materials after hydrothermal and impact processing. Project 
two involves characterizing the interactions of chiral ligands with a 
variety of cations to determine if chirality has an effect on the 
resulting complex, to explore whether this could be a viable route for 
prebiotic evolution leading to homochirality.

The position requires a Ph.D. in geochemistry or inorganic chemistry, 
and the successful candidate must have expertise in scanning electron 
microscopy, X-ray diffraction, and solution-phase coordination 
chemistry, as well as experience processing insoluble organic material 
such as kerogen for analysis. Experience with gas chromatography-mass 
spectrometry is a strong plus.

LUNAR AND SMALL BODIES GRADUATE CONFERENCE 2019

Abstract submission deadline: June 21, 2019

Registration is now open for the 10th Annual Lunar and Small Bodies 
Graduate Conference (LunGradCon 2019) to be held on Monday, July 22, 
2019 at the NASA Ames Research Center, preceding the NASA Exploration 
Science Forum (ESF, July 23-25). With the expanded interests of the 
Solar System Exploration Research Virtual Institute (SSERVI), the scope 
of LunGradCon includes both lunar and small body science. LunGradCon 
provides an opportunity for grad students and early-career postdocs to 
present their research on lunar and small body science in a low-stress, 
friendly environment, being critiqued only by their peers. In addition 
to oral presentations, the conference presents opportunities for 
professional development and networking with fellow grad students and 
postdocs, as well as senior members of SSERVI. A limited amount of 
funding will be provided for travel and lodging costs. The deadline 
for LunGradCon registration and abstract submission is June 21, 2019, 
11:59 PM PDT. LunGradCon attendees are highly encouraged to also submit 
abstracts to the ESF.

AGU SESSION: ENGAGEMENT OPPORTUNITIES FOR EVERYONE THROUGH SCIENCE 
FESTIVALS
 
Increasing numbers of think pieces and news articles position 
scientists as experts yet still leave people questioning the science. 
Now, more than ever, it is crucial for scientists to be present in 
conversations around scientific subjects. Enter: science festivals. 
This session will illustrate the power of engaging public audiences 
with science festivals through descriptions of ongoing events, 
discussions of evaluation methods and results, and connecting 
scientists with resources and experts to help them join current 
festivals, or start their own. For scientists already engaging with 
public audiences, this session will provide next-steps for 
communicating their science. This session will focus on what science 
festivals are, why engagement is important for scientists, and how 
scientists can connect with this living resource. Abstracts from 
education/communication professionals and scientists are welcome. 
Topics of interest may include science communication at live events, 
scientists' engagement and outreach activities, and evaluation.

2019 Fall AGU abstract submission deadline is July 31, 2019 at

AGU SESSION P011: EVIDENCE OF WATER-ROCK INTERACTION THROUGHOUT THE 
SOLAR SYSTEM

We are pleased to invite abstracts for the following session at the 
2019 AGU Fall Meeting in San Francisco, CA, December 9-13, 2019.

This session is devoted to work documenting and constraining the 
conditions and fate of early Solar System water. Water-rock 
interactions play an essential role in the origin, existence, and 
prospects of life, as well as the evolution of planetary surfaces. It 
is necessary to identify and characterize water's presence, abundance, 
chemistry, and distribution in order to constrain early Solar System 
conditions, including those prevailing on Earth during the emergence 
of life. This broad view will be united by a focus on using records of 
water-rock interaction to reconstruct aqueous conditions through time 
and space, including the importance of distinguishing between primary 
and diagenetic signals. This session seeks contributions applying 
field, geochemical, geomorphological, and/or theoretical methods to 
characterize aqueous processes through time on Solar System bodies 
including: the Moon, Earth (including analog studies), Mars, 
asteroids, and outer Solar System moons.

The submission deadline is Wednesday, July 31, 2019.

AGU SESSION P040: TITAN - THE EXOTIC AND ENIGMATIC MOON 

Saturn's giant moon Titan is one of the most mysterious, and yet 
strangely familiar, realms in the Solar System. Possessing a dense 
atmosphere enriched in organic compounds, its active photochemistry 
works to produce a panoply of molecules of increasing size and 
complexity, running the gamut from ethane to haze particles. This 
session solicits presentations on all aspects of Titan research, 
including on-going Cassini dataset analysis, Earth-based observations, 
modeling, laboratory investigations, and comparison with other bodies.

Conveners: Conor Nixon (NASA GSFC), Alex Hayes (Cornell University), 
Kathleen Mandt (Johns Hopkins APL)

Submissions welcome until: 31 July 2019 23:59 EDT/03:59 +1 GMT.

SPECIAL ISSUE "OBSERVATIONS AND MEASUREMENTS OF THE MARTIAN ATMOSPHERE"

For over 200 years, humanity has known that Mars has an atmosphere, but 
it was not until the advent of space-based observations beginning with 
the Mariner spacecraft that a clear understanding of the composition, 
temperature, and dynamics of the Martian atmosphere began to form. These 
observations have provided new insight into the major processes active 
in the Mars atmosphere, including the importance of the CO2, water, and 
dust cycles for driving the current climate, and the role of processes 
in the upper atmosphere for driving long-term atmospheric evolution.

Given the wealth of data collected by past missions to the red planet 
and the numerous missions presently at Mars that, when considered in 
aggregate, are characterizing the entire atmosphere, it is timely to 
bring together a collection of papers on the latest analyses of Mars 
atmospheric observations and measurements. We encourage submissions of 
research that analyze data from any region of the Mars atmosphere, 
including the ionosphere. Further, although space-based observations 
are emphasized, ground-based measurements are also welcome.
