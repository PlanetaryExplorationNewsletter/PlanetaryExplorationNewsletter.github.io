GSA SESSION PROPOSALS DUE FEBRUARY 20

Help guide the science at GSA.

If you are interested in attending GSA this fall in Phoenix (September 
22-25), please consider submitting a session proposal! If you would 
like to learn more about a certain topic or showcase an awesome 
collection of research or even bring attention to a topic of interest 
or concern, a great way to do that is through a Topical Session or 
Pardee Keynote. 

Having sponsorship from one or more GSA divisions, another society, or 
allied organizations is encouraged and can help get your session 
advertised, but is not necessary. To receive sponsorship from a GSA 
division, please email the division chair with your proposal idea.

HABITABILITY

Abstract deadline extended to: February 19, 2019

This session will be devoted to understanding icy worlds in the outer 
Solar System, including those containing subsurface oceans, their 
possible analogues around other stars, and their associated processes 
and geochemistry that might support life. The session will include 
solicited and contributed presentations addressing observational, 
laboratory, and theoretical studies relevant to past, ongoing, and 
future missions.

Relevant topics include: (1) interior structure, composition, and 
thermal evolution, (2) surface geology and composition, (3) orbital 
dynamics and tidal interactions.

AOGS SESSION PS14: SMALL BODY EXPLORATIONS BY CURRENT AND FUTURE 
MISSIONS

Abstract deadline extended to: February 19, 2019

This session welcomes abstracts about the new results of Solar System 
small bodies from past and ongoing exploration missions, and about the 
development and concepts of future missions. We also welcome abstracts 
about the related ground-based observations, laboratory experiments, 
as well as theoretical studies. Abstracts reporting the new results 
from Dawn, New Horizons, Hayabusa2 and OSIRIS-REx missions are 
especially welcome. In the context of the recent wave of small body 
exploration missions, as well as the future missions currently under 
development and/or consideration by NASA, ESA, JAXA, China, etc., this 
session is designed to promote the research of Solar System small 
bodies from the past and current missions and to help develop concepts 
for future missions.

THREE POSTDOCTORAL POSITIONS IN MARS SCIENCE

The Department of Planetology and Habitability at the Centro de 
Astrobiologia (CAB) invites applications for three postdoctoral 
positions to support investigations on the nature of the early Mars 
environments. We are seeking enthusiastic and excellent candidates to 
join a planetary science team funded by the European Research Council 
(ERC), working with Dr. Alberto Fairen in the Project "MarsFirstWater" 
(ERC Consolidator Grant) broadening the efforts of the Project 
"icyMARS" (ERC Starting Grant).

Applicants should have a recent Ph.D. in the field of Planetary 
Science or related discipline, and a background in Mars research. 
Expertise in Geomorphology/Sedimentology, Geochemistry, and 
Microbiology, respectively for each of the positions, is required.

The 3 positions, placed in Madrid, would be for two years, with 
possible extension to a third year contingent upon satisfactory 
performance. Applicants should send a letter of interest, a curriculum 
with a list of publications, a brief (maximum two pages) statement of 
research interests, and a list of three references, no later than 
March 15, 2019, to Alberto Fairen (agfairen@cab.inta-csic.es).

The starting date is negotiable, but should be no later than 
Sep 1, 2019.

IUGG/IAMAS SESSION M24: CLOUDS AND CIRCULATIONS IN PLANETARY 
ATMOSPHERES

Abstract deadline: February 18

We now have new information on clouds and atmospheric circulations, 
including Earth. There are some similarities and many differences among 
the clouds, their origins and impacts. Especially, for all planets 
including Earth, cloud motions are a key measurement in studying global 
circulations and there have been recently many improvements in the 
techniques. The symposium invites presentations on the clouds or 
measurements involving clouds on different planets, including Earth.

SURVEY ASSESSING PLANETARY DATA ACCESS AND USE

Hello planetary scientists, I am a graduate student at the University 
of Tennessee Knoxville and am conducting a survey to find out more 
about scientists' experiences finding, accessing, and using planetary 
data. Please consider taking this survey, which should take about 
10-20 minutes. Here is the link to the survey: 

https://utk.questionpro.com/t/AOrSnZdnsr 

Please also feel free to pass this on to anyone you know who works 
with planetary data. No identifying information will be collected as 
part of this survey and all responses will be kept confidential. If you 
have any questions regarding this survey or project please contact 
Rose Borden at rborden4@vols.utk.edu.

GOLDSCHMIDT SESSION 01G: BEYOND EARTH AND EARTH-LIKE - THE 
COMPOSITIONAL DIVERSITY AND EVOLUTION OF EXOPLANETS

The compositional diversity predicted to exist in exoplanets represents 
a new frontier in geologic science. Over the coming decades, the 
available dataset on planets outside our Solar System will continue to 
expand, improving our statistical understanding of planetary properties 
(mass, radius, but also orbit, host star properties and atmospheric 
spectra). The composition, mineralogy, dynamics, and structure of these 
bodies may be wholly different from the Earth and planets in our Solar 
System and present exciting challenges for observers, experimentalists, 
and modelers alike. In this session we will explore the effects of 
exoplanetary composition on the evolution of planetary surfaces and 
interiors. We invite contributions to help quantify the range of 
possible rocky planet interiors, with a particular interest for 
contributions expanding the compositional space usually studied in 
Earth Science, Cosmochemistry and Planetary Science. Potential topics 
include planetary accretion and differentiation, mineral 
phase-equilibria and physical properties, volatile storage and 
transport, and surface/mantle interactions. Abstracts reporting 
observational, modeling and experimental results are welcome.
