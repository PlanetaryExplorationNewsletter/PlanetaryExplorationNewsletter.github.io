[NASA] ROSES-18 AMENDMENT 50: DELAY OF DUE DATES

Because of the continuing government shut down, the following changes
are made to three programs with near term due dates:

C.28 Lunar Surface Instrument and Technology Payloads Step-2 proposal
due date is changed from January 17, 2019 to TBD.

C.29 Astrodynamics in Support of Icy Worlds Missions Step-1 proposal
due date is changed from January 18, 2019 to TBD.

E.4 Habitable Worlds Step-2 proposal due date is changed from January
17, 2019 to TBD.

This amendment notes that several programs with upcoming due dates
have had their due dates changed to TBD. A new due date will be set
for each program, and announced via amendment(s) to ROSES-2018, after
the government returns. It is expected that some additional time will
be provided because there are proposers who have been unable to work
because of the shutdown. Please note that the solicitation close date
shown in NSPIRES is NOT a proposal due date; the system requires a
specific date be used rather than 'TBD'.

ABSCICON 2019 SESSION: ASTROBIOGEOCHEMISTRY - MODELLING BIOLOGY AND
ITS CO-EVOLUTION WITH THE ENVIRONMENT ON EARTH AND IMPLICATIONS FOR
EXOPLANETS

Submission Deadline: 23 January 2019 23:59 EST

https://agu.confex.com/agu/abscicon19/prelim.cgi/Session/67196

As the field of astrobiology has matured it has become clear that
interdisciplinary approaches are essential for identifying habitable
and inhabited environments and increasing our chances of locating life
elsewhere in the universe. Investigating the co-evolution of life and
its environment is important to understand the role of biology in
maintaining stable long-term conditions on a planetary surface, as
well as the role specific environments play in promoting life. Our
search for life on exoplanets will depend on our ability to spectrally
characterize and understand the abiotic and biotic contributions to
planetary atmospheric chemical compositions and disequilibria.
Essential for this undertaking is an understanding of the type and
extent of biology (including metabolisms) that can support, or be
supported by, differing atmospheric states on exoplanets. We welcome a
diverse array of presentations that seek to further our understanding
of the co-evolution of life with its environment on a planetary scale,
including novel interdisciplinary strategies relevant to remote life
detection.

ABSCICON 2019 SESSION: TO BOLDLY GO - NEXT-GENERATION INSTRUMENTATION
FOR IN SITU LIFE DETECTION

Submission deadline: 23 January 2019 23:59 EST

https://agu.confex.com/agu/abscicon19/prelim.cgi/Session/67147

We would like to encourage you to attend the Astrobiology Science
Conference, which will be held 24-28 June 2019 in Bellevue, 
Washington.

https://connect.agu.org/abscicon/home

To Boldly Go: Next-Generation Instrumentation for In Situ Life
Detection

The recently released National Academies' Astrobiology Strategy
emphasized the need to place the search for life front and center in
mission planning and instrument design. To meet this challenge, we
must develop and mature in situ life detection instruments for
planetary missions. This session will cover measurement requirements,
technologies, and instruments for life detection, and challenges for
their implementation in situ on or within Solar System worlds
(including, but not limited to Mars, Enceladus, Europa). We welcome
approaches suitable for detecting ancient and extant life, including
molecular biomarkers, environmental signatures, and/or other
properties of life.

Thank you for your consideration. 

Sincerely,

Conveners and Co-Conveners C. E. Carr, C. M. Phillips-Lander, A. S.

ABSCICON 2019 SESSION: ORIGINS AND EVOLUTION PATHWAYS OF ORGANICS IN
OCEAN WORLDS

Submission deadline: 6 March 2019

https://agu.confex.com/agu/abscicon19/prelim.cgi/Session/65833

We invite abstract submissions to the 2019 AbSciCon (June 24-28 in
Seattle) session: Origins and Evolution Pathways of Organics in Ocean
Worlds

Evidence for organics has been found across the solar system with
telescopic observations. Organic compounds have been recently observed
with spacecraft at Enceladus, Titan, and Ceres. Understanding the
origins and fates of carbon and organics in ocean worlds is an
important topic considering the potential of these bodies for
fostering conditions conducive to the development of biomolecules.
Predicting the cycling of accreted carbon compounds, local prebiotic
chemistry, and the mechanisms driving surface exposure requires
interdisciplinary research covering astrochemical and geochemical
modeling, meteorite analyses, material physics, and geophysical
processes to understand the information returned by telescopic and
spacecraft observations. This session welcomes contributions covering
observations, theory and experiments.

Feel free to forward this message to your colleagues and students who
might be interested.

We look forward to seeing you in Seattle!

ABSCICON 2019 SESSION: FROM ORGANIC MOLECULES TO BIOSIGNATURES

Submission Deadline: 23 January 2019 23:59 EST

https://agu.confex.com/agu/abscicon19/prelim.cgi/Session/65933

Organic matter is critical for habitability of an extraterrestrial
environment and development of life. It is believed that life on Earth
arose from a chemical self-organization and complexification of simple
organic molecules. Many questions remain about the nature and origin
of these building blocks of life. Understanding chemical processes
that occur in varied environments of the solar system, and
investigating the nature, abundance and distribution of organic
molecules, give insights into prebiotic chemistry that occurred on
primitive Earth. It also provides valuable information on the
habitability and potential for life throughout the solar system. We
invite contributions about multiple aspects of the search for organic
molecules and biosignatures, including: (1) remote or in situ
observations of organic matter; (2) field work, experimental and
modeling studies that could predict organics distribution; (3)
promising locations, instrument concepts and strategies for
investigating organic astrochemistry, including sample return; (4)
identify the relevant substances, patterns, or combinations that could
be biosignatures; (5) define most relevant array of measurements to be
implemented.

We look forward to seeing you in Seattle!

CENTAUR EXPLORATION WORKSHOP: THE ROOTS OF ACTIVITY

A workshop addressing the scientific importance and space exploration
relevance of active centaurs, with a specific focus on mapping
knowledge gaps and paths forward.

Workshop URL: 

https://cew2019.arc.nasa.gov/ 

Alternate URL for abstract/Registration during the government 
shutdown:

https://sservi.nasa.gov/cew2019

This workshop will be held on March 6-8, 2019 at the University of
Central Florida (Orlando, FL), under the auspices of the Florida Space
Institute, the Center for Lunar and Asteroid Surface Science and
SSERVI Central. The workshop's impetus is two-fold: Advance our
understanding of how small bodies originate, evolve and become active
beyond Jupiter's orbit; Planning of exploration strategies - Both
Earth-based observations and Space-based measurements - aimed at
representative objects of the Centaur population. The former serves as
our science rationale and context, while the latter will help focus
our workshop discussions and deliverables on future remote and in-situ
characterization of specific targets. We strongly encourage the
participation of early career researchers (including graduate students
and postdoctoral researchers).

Please note: 
- NOI, Registration and Abstract submission are open.
- Abstracts submission and registration deadline: January 15, 2019
- Online participation will be available and still require 
  registration
- In-situ participation may be capped due to space limitation
