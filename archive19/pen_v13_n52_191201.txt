2020 PIERAZZO INTERNATIONAL STUDENT TRAVEL AWARD

Application deadline: 9 PM PST, December 6, 2019

Awards will be announced on or before December 13, 2019.

This award is established by the Planetary Science Institute in memory
of Senior Scientist Betty Pierazzo to support and encourage graduate
students to build international collaborations and relationships in
planetary science. Two awards will be made each year, contingent upon
there being meritorious applications. One will be awarded to a graduate
student working on his or her Ph.D. at an institution within the U.S.
This is to support travel to a planetary science related meeting
(conferences and workshops) outside of the U.S. The second award will
be to a graduate student working on his or her Ph.D. at an institution
outside of the U.S. This is to support travel to a planetary science
related meeting within the U.S. These include general meetings that
have planetary-focused sessions such as the AGU, GSA, EGU and IAG.

The award will consist of a certificate and up to $2000.

EGU 2020 SESSION: EXTRA-TERRESTRIAL SEDIMENTOLOGY, STRATIGRAPHY AND 
TERRESTRIAL ANALOGUES

Abstract submission deadline: January 15, 2020, 13:00 CET

In the past two decades, the level of robotic exploration of other 
planetary bodies has been unprecedented. What is ubiquitous in 
virtually all missions is that evidence for sedimentary processes have 
been identified on each planetary body visited, based on observations 
of geomorphic features and stratigraphy. Sedimentology will be key for 
underpinning our understanding of planetary processes, and guiding the 
missions toward their goal. This session invites any contribution 
towards any celestial body, visited by a mission, (Venus, Mars, Titan, 
Pluto and 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko), using all techniques, such as 
sedimentology, geochemistry, spectral imaging. In addition to the 
classic contributions, we particularly welcome presentations that 
utilise appropriate Earth analogues, both modern and ancient and/or 
laboratory/numerical simulation.

[NASA] ROSES-19: C.23 INTERDISCIPLINARY CONSORTIA FOR ASTROBIOLOGY 
RESEARCH

Mandatory 5-page Step-1 proposals deadline: January 31, 2020
Step-2 proposals deadline: April 3, 2020

Proposals for Interdisciplinary Consortia for Astrobiology Research 
(ICAR) must describe an interdisciplinary approach to a single 
compelling question in astrobiology, and address at least one aspect of 
the 2015 Science Strategy. Team size and resources requested should be 
appropriate to the scale of the proposed research. There is no ideal 
size of an ICAR Team. Because this is an opportunity for larger teams 
and for five years of support, the scope of the research, and 
subsequently the resources needed, should exceed those typically 
considered in a Research Opportunities in Space and Earth Sciences 
(ROSES) program element (e.g., Exobiology, Habitable Worlds).

DIRECTOR/DEPARTMENT HEAD - LUNAR AND PLANETARY LABORATORY/PLANETARY 
SCIENCES

Since its founding in 1960, the Lunar and Planetary Laboratory (LPL) at 
the University of Arizona (UArizona) has been at the forefront of 
planetary science and Solar Systems research. LPL currently leads some 
of NASA's highest-profile missions and instruments and is continuously 
seeking future opportunities. LPL is engaged in a broad range of 
research that includes theoretical, experimental, and observational 
investigations of our Solar System, as well as exoplanets and their 
origins. LPL integrates spacecraft missions and cutting-edge analytical 
facilities into its research portfolio, and its teaching and graduate 
program produces scholars who become leaders in the field. 
The successful candidate will have demonstrated excellence in planetary 
science research, strong leadership and management skills, teaching 
experience, and a commitment to diversity. The Director is expected to 
lead LPL in developing and executing a clear vision during a period of 
expansion. The LPL Director works with local and external stakeholders 
such as NASA and NSF to maintain and grow an enriching environment

exoplanets. As part of this strategic effort, we are looking to hire a 
postdoctoral researcher with experience in exoplanet characterization. 
The deadline for applying for this position is December 9. They will 
work with our team of exoplanet and planetary scientists, including 
Kevin Stevenson, Kathleen Mandt, and many others to conduct research 
on exoplanet atmospheric characterization and Solar System comparative 
planetology. APL is a world leader in space science and the design, 
development, and operation of NASA-funded missions. Joining the APL 
team will open up opportunities to conduct ground- and space-based 
observations and to participate in work with space missions. 

APL provides generous salary, benefits, and promotes a culture that 
values healthy work/life balance. APL's campus is located in the 
Baltimore-Washington metro area. Apply for this position here:

POSTDOC POSITION: EVOLUTION AND PRESENT-DAY STATE OF MARS' SUBSURFACE 
ENVIRONMENT

The Institute of Planetary Research at the German Aerospace Center 
(DLR) in Berlin invites applications for a postdoc position within the 
framework of a DLR junior research group. The group investigates the 
thermochemical evolution of Mars and Venus and employs an 
interdisciplinary approach that combines large-scale geodynamical 
models of thermal evolution with petrological and geological datasets. 
The successful candidate will combine geomorphological analysis of the 
Martian surface with modeling of the subsurface thermal environment of 
Mars. The goal of the project is to collect a large and diverse dataset 
about the geomorphology, spectroscopy and mineralogy of the Martian 
surface. These data, combined with results from large-scale 
geodynamical models of the Martian interior, will be applied to 
interpret the evolution and present-day state of the subsurface 
environment of Mars. In particular, this work will be used to provide 
constraints on the past and present-day distribution of potential 
subsurface water on Mars and to identify possible habitable regions in 
the Martian subsurface.

Candidates should hold a Ph.D. degree in Planetary Science, Geology, 
Geophysics or closely related field.
