RESTRUCTURING NASA'S PLANETARY RESEARCH PROGRAMS FOR ROSES 2020

The document to be submitted to NASA is posted at:

https://oort.psi.edu/public/rereorg-proposal

The raw Survey data that informed the above document is available at:

https://oort.psi.edu/public/rereorg-survey-raw

Public Comment on "Reorganizing NASA Planetary Research Programs for 
ROSES 2020" is now open at:

https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/rereorg_public_comment

It will be open until Saturday, October 12, at 5 PM PDT. Unlike the 
recent Survey, which was anonymous, the Public Comments are not 
anonymous. After the site closes, the Public Comments will be 
available at:

https://oort.psi.edu/public/rereorg-public-comments

NASA will be sent, for its consideration, the "ReReorg" Proposal, 
along with the raw data from the Survey and the Public Comments 
collected here. 

This proposal has benefitted greatly from the thoughts and 
contributions of hundreds of our planetary community colleagues. Our 
community is a great, deep and generous resource. 

Thank you all.
