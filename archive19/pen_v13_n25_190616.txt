LLOYD V. BERKNER SPACE POLICY INTERNSHIPS AUTUMN 2019

The goal of the Lloyd V. Berkner Space Policy Internship is to provide 
promising undergraduate and graduate students with the opportunity to 
work in the area of civil space research policy in the nation's 
capital, under the aegis of the National Academies of Sciences, 
Engineering, and Medicine's Space Science Board. The autumn program is 
open to undergraduate and graduate students. The deadline for 
applications has been extended to 1 July. The selected candidate(s) 
will be contacted no later than 1 August. Additional information about 
the program, including application procedure, can be found at:

CLEVER PLANETS POST-DOC OPPORTUNITY

The CLEVER (Cycles of Life-Essential Volatile Elements in Rocky)
Planets team and Department of Earth, Environmental and Planetary 
Sciences at Rice University are seeking applicants for a postdoctoral 
scholar position who would explore dynamical and geochemical 
fingerprints of accretion and magma ocean processes, searching for 
conditions of producing thermo-chemically habitable rocky planets. The 
focus will be tracking the fate of life-essential volatile elements, C, 
N, H, and S in our Solar System and other exoplanetary systems from the 
protoplanetary disk to the end of magma ocean stage via dynamical and 
geochemical modeling. The contract will be initially for 1 year and is 
renewable for up to 3 years based on progress and performance. The 
salary would commensurate with experience. The position will be based 
out of Rice University but the post-doctoral candidate will also have 
the opportunity to interact with astrophysicists and planetary 
scientists at UCLA and UC Davis and other team members and 
collaborators.

5TH BEIJING EARTH AND PLANETARY INTERIORS SYMPOSIUM

The 5th Beijing Earth and Planetary Interiors Symposium (BEPIS) will be 
held on 24-27 August 2019 at the Institute of Geology and Geophysics, 
Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China.

BEPIS focuses on observations and theoretical advances in palaeo-, 
geo-, bio-, and rock magnetism, geodynamo theories and models, as well 
as planetary magnetism, with a primary aim of further understanding of 
the origin, structure, and variations of Earth's magnetic fields.

Registration and abstract submission: 

http://bepis2019.csp.escience.cn

Deadline for registration and abstract submission: June 30, 2019.

If you have questions please do not hesitate to contact Yongxin Pan 
(yxpan@mail.iggcas.ac.cn).

We cordially invite friends old and new to participate in the 
BEPIS2019!

All the best,

THE FIRST BILLION YEARS: HABITABILITY

Call for Abstracts

The First Billion Years: Habitability conference will be held in Big 
Sky, Montana from September 8-12. The conference focuses on 
habitability, producing conditions conducive to life, the emergence of 
life on Earth, the potential for the emergence of life on other Solar 
System bodies, and extensions to extrasolar systems. The conference 
format is intended to foster multi- and interdisciplinary discussion on 
the processes and physical conditions that affected the development of 
potentially habitable environments during the first billion years, how 
such environments evolved over time, and how such ideas may be tested 
with current and future laboratory measurements, field studies, 
astronomical observations, and spacecraft missions.

A one-day excursion to Yellowstone National Park is planned to explore 
the biologic potential of hydrothermal systems in volcanic settings and 
to discuss a similar potential in impact-generated hydrothermal systems 
that may have existed during the dawn of life nearly 4 billion years 
ago.

The abstract deadline is July 3 at 5pm CDT.

[NASA] NEW NSPIRES RELEASE 

This upgrade includes a new layout and look to the web site. Changes to 
NSPIRES functionally are very limited with this release. NSPIRES 7.1 is 
a first step in the major improvements planned for the NSPIRES web site 
as a result of the system refresh activities. Future releases will 
include functional and user experience improvements.

This 7.1 upgrade includes some functional changes to address users'
refresh requirements and other minor improvements:

- Allow users to create an NOI or Proposal from the solicitation page, 
  before and after log in.
- Improved user interface for reviewers to access their assigned 
  proposals as well as panel proposals.
- Updated 508 compliance.
- Bug Fixes.

Regards,

The NSPIRES Development Staff

[NASA] ROSES-19: C.11 DDAP CHANGE IN SCOPE

The objective of DDAP is to enhance the scientific return of Discovery 
Program missions and broaden the scientific participation in the 
analysis of data, both recent and archived, collected by Discovery 
missions.

The Discovery missions previously retired from this program have been 
reinstated to Section 1.1, and the expected program budget for the 
first year of new awards and number of new awards pending adequate 
proposals of merit have been changed. New text is in bold and deleted 
text is struck through. The due dates are unchanged.

FALL AGU SESSION P010: DEEP DIVE ENCELADUS

For the 14th year in a row, the Fall AGU Special Session on Saturn's 
geysering moon, Enceladus will rock on! Our goals are: 

1) the synthesis of the latest information and ideas from fields as 
   diverse as planetary geophysics, volcanology, microbiology, 
   oceanography, biogeochemistry, astrobiology, hydrothermal systems, 
   seafloor geology and geophysics, and origin of life; and 
2) utilizing these new results in the development of a framework for 
   evaluating the moon's potential for life and assessing the best 
   means to search for life in the future. 

Cassini data analysis, theoretical studies, and improvements in 
established models are all producing new insights. There will be lots 
to discuss. We encourage submissions in the above-mentioned areas. 
Presentations on concepts for future missions back to Enceladus will 
also be considered.

Join us!

The workshop “Planet Mars V” will be the fifth edition of a series 
which has taken place in the Center of Physics in Les Houches since 
2003. These workshops were organized to bring together senior 
scientists, young scientists, postdocs and students in order to 
optimize the analysis and interpretation of space data, and to prepare 
the community for the best exploitation of forthcoming missions.

The deadline for registration is November 1, 2019.
