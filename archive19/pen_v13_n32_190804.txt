TENURE TRACK ASTROBIOLOGY POSITION AT IPM

Applications are invited for a tenure-track assistant professor
position in the Division for Astrobiology, Institute for Planetary
Materials, Okayama University. We seek a candidate who will be able to
develop a novel and independent research program in one of the research
areas in astrobiology, such as analytical or experimental studies of
prebiotic chemistry, mineral-water-organic interactions related to the
origin of life, the search for signatures of primitive life on the
early Earth or in the Solar System, and also work within a
collaborative environment with other staff to pursue joint researches
on Earth and planetary materials. 

For further information, please contact:

Professor Xianyu Xue
Chair of the Selection Committee for the Faculty in the Division for
Astrobiology, Institute for Planetary Materials
Okayama University 827 Yamada, Misasa, Tottori, 682-0193, Japan

SURVEY ON MAJOR MERCURY AND PLANETARY SCIENCE QUESTIONS FOR THE
UPCOMING DECADAL SURVEY

Dear Mercury Community,

In preparation for the upcoming Planetary Science Decadal Survey, NASA
has asked the planetary science Analysis Groups to engage their
communities for help in framing the big science questions that might
drive planetary science over the next decadal cycle. In the current
absence of an AG for Mercury, NASA HQ is looking for a coordinated,
Mercury-focused community response.

Starting with published sources, the recent Mercury lander white paper,
and the call for establishing a Mercury Analysis Group that arose from
the Mercury 2018 meeting, we have collated a basic set of questions
that could be used as the basis for the Mercury-focused responses to
NASA.

At this point, we need your ideas, additional input, and feedback on
these potential questions and/or your own candidates, to encompasses
the full breadth of the work that needs to be done at Mercury and in
planetary science in general.

Please participate in this process by completing the following survey
by August 6, 2019.

OPAG MEETING UPDATE

The next OPAG Meeting will be held August 20-21, 2019 Boulder, CO. The
day prior, August 19th will be the Ocean World Access Working Group
Workshop. The meeting will be held at the University of Colorado's
Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics (LASP), Space Science
Building, Room W120 (SPSC) on East Campus, 3665 Discovery Drive,
Boulder, Colorado, 80303. Directions to SPSC can be found at

We will host a poster session for student awardees, technology (with a
focus on ICEE-2 and similar Icy World in situ instruments and sampling
systems), and mission concepts. If you wish to present a poster at
OPAG, please send the title and author(s) to Morgan Cable:

TOWARDS OTHER EARTH III: FROM SOLAR SYSTEM TO EXOPLANETS

June 1-5, 2020
Lamego, Douro Valley, Portugal
Venue: Theater Ribeiro Conceicao, Lamego, Portugal

Atmosphere, Interior, formation and evolution of planets and planetary
systems. The Solar System Planets and Exoplanets communities aim at
answering similar questions, but seldom interact due to the different
datasets they have access to.

We aim to discuss how the detailed and in situ datasets from Solar
System planets can inform the often under constrained exoplanetary
models. We will try to uncover how the diversity and large sample
offered by exoplanets can put in context and inform our understanding
of Solar System planets, focusing on each of these categories:

1. Super-Earths, Mercury, Venus, Mars and Earth
2. Ice giants, Uranus and Neptune
3. Gas giants, Jupiter and Saturn
4. Planetary System architecture

GETTING READY FOR LSST WORKSHOP AT EPSC-DPS 2019

Thursday September 19, 2019 1:30-3:15pm
Geneva, Switzerland

Open to all EPSC-DPS attendees

The Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST; http://lsst.org) is an 
8-meter, wide-field, ground-based survey program that will survey half 
the sky every few nights in six optical bands. The LSST telescope is 
currently being constructed at Cerro Pachon, Chile, with first light 
expected in 2020 and start of survey operations in 2022. The LSST is 
slated to make a significant contribution to the study of the Solar 
System, delivering over a billion highly precise observations of 
millions of Solar System objects (5mmag photometry and 10mas astrometry, 
per observation, at the bright end). Current estimates show yields 
ranging from ~100,000 new discoveries of nearby NEOs, to 5.5 million for 
the main belt, and ~40,000 for KBO populations. The majority of these 
objects will receive hundreds of observations in multiple 
bandpasses.This dataset presents tremendous opportunities for Solar 
System science. This town hall/workshop will overview the science 
possibilities, report on project status and expected data products, and 
discuss how to get involved in preparations for science with LSST.
