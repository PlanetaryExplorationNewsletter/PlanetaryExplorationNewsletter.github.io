SURVEY ON RESTRUCTURING NASA'S PLANETARY RESEARCH AND ANALYSIS 
PROGRAMS

In 2014, NASA announced the reorganization of the planetary R&A 
programs. Merging a number of disparate programs into Solar System 
Workings created a behemoth to which well over 300 proposals have been 
submitted each year. This proved unwealdy for managers, reviewers, 
and proposers alike. We propose SSW be broken up into four programs:

   Inner Planet Research and Analysis (IPRA)
   - Mercury, Venus, Moon

   Mars Fundamental Research (MFR)

   Small Bodies Research and Analysis (SBRA)
   - Asteroids, comets, interplanetary dust, KBOs, 
     and dwarf planets (excluding the Pluto-Charon system)

   Outer Planets Research and Analysis (OPRA)
   - Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune and Pluto-Charon Systems

Most other programs are maintained, with suggestions for mission data 
analysis programs (DAPs) and the treatment of geologic maps.

See draft proposal:

We would like to invite all NASA-funded planetary scientists to 
participate in a survey on these proposed revisions to planetary R&A 
for ROSES 2020:

The survey will close 5 PM PDT, Monday, October 7, and will inform
the above proposal. Results and the submitted proposal will be 
published by October 15.

Thank you!

Mueller, Nalin Samarasinha (PSI)
