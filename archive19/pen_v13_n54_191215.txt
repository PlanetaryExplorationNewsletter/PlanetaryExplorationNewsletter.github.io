[NASA] ROSES: DUE DATE DELAY FOR GRAVITY/RADIO SCIENCE TEAM
CO-INVESTIGATORS FOR THE EUROPA CLIPPER MISSION

The objectives of the Europa Clipper Gravity/Radio Science Team
(Clipper G/RS) Program are to 1) add new members to the Europa Clipper
science team with expertise in gravity, radio science, and/or similar
investigations to the Europa Clipper science team; and 2) expand
science community participation on the existing Europa Clipper science
team. The program will select a Lead Scientist and Co-Investigators
(Co-Is) to populate the Clipper G/RS team.

The due date for proposals to serve as the Lead Scientist have passed.
This Amendment delays the due date only for proposals for
Co-Investigators. For those who have already submitted their Mandatory
NOIs, proposals are due January 24, 2020. The planning start date for
Co-Investigators is now April 1, 2020.

[NASA] ROSES: NEW OPPORTUNITY - MARS 2020 PARTICIPATING SCIENTIST 
PROGRAM

The C.26 Mars 2020 Participating Scientist Program is to enhance the
scientific return from the mission by broadening participation, 
augmenting the existing Mars 2020 science team to include new
investigations that broaden and/or complement the funded Principal
Investigator-led investigations, thus maximizing the contribution of
Mars 2020 to the future exploration and scientific understanding of
Mars. The second goal of this opportunity is to increase the number of 
scientists supporting daily mission operations.

The timing of this solicitation is designed to permit selection and
training of participating scientists (PSs) in time to contribute fully
to both pre-landing activities such as landing site analysis and
science operations immediately upon arrival at Mars. Selected
participating scientists will become members of the Mars 2020 science
team and be required to fulfill responsibilities similar to those of
current science team members.

A Notice of Intent (NOI) is mandatory for all proposers. NOIs are due 
January 13, 2020, and proposals are due March 12, 2020.

2020 ANNUAL MEETING OF PLANETARY GEOLOGIC MAPPERS

June 16-18, 2020, Denver, Colorado.

The purpose of the annual meeting of planetary geologic mappers is to
report progress on NASA-funded geologic mapping projects. Other
planetary geologists who are conducting geologic mapping are also
welcome to attend. The meeting serves as a venue to discuss problems
and issues relevant to the planetary mapping community. Findings are
determined from plenary discussion sessions and then presented to the
MAPSIT Steering Committee to forward to NASA Headquarters Program
Officers. The meeting usually includes a GIS Q&A session with USGS
scientists, and this year will include a discussion of potential next
generation of maps required for future landings and exploration on the
Moon and Mars.

IMPORTANT: To be added to the mailing list to receive pertinent
information about this workshop and to indicate your interest in
participating, please submit an Indication of Interest by February 16,
2020.

EGU 2020 SESSION PS3.6/AS4.21/ST3.5: ATMOSPHERES AND EXOSPHERES OF
TERRESTRIAL PLANETS, SATELLITES, AND EXOPLANETS

The abstract submission is open for EGU 2020, held in Vienna on May 
3-8.

The deadline for the abstract submission is January 15, 2020, 13:00 CET

I would like to draw your attention to our session: "Atmospheres and
exospheres of terrestrial planets, satellites, and exoplanets".

This session primarily focuses on the neutral atmospheres of
terrestrial bodies other than the Earth. This includes not only Venus
and Mars, but also exoplanets with comparable envelopes and satellites
carrying dense atmospheres such as Titan or exospheres such as
Ganymede. We welcome contributions dealing with processes affecting the
atmospheres of these bodies, from the surface to the exosphere. We
invite abstracts concerning observations, both from Earth or from
space, modeling and theoretical studies, or laboratory work.
Comparative planetology abstracts will be particularly appreciated.

EGU 2020 SESSION PS1.4-ST4: PLANETARY SPACE WEATHER

Deadline for abstract submission is Jan 15, 2020, 13:00 CET.

As conveners we would like to invite researchers in the planetary space
weather community and in the planetary environments to submit
abstracts.

In the present session, we welcome abstracts from all planets' upstream
solar wind activities and their relation to planetary space weather,
including especially magnetized bodies (like Mercury, the Earth, Saturn
and Jupiter) as well as comparisons with unmagnetized bodies (Mars and
Venus), with a special focus of this session on the planet Mercury
whose environment in a few years will be the main goal of the dual
ESA/JAXA mission BepiColombo.

In this frame, we welcome studies on:
- magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling dynamics (and auroras where
  present);
- the solar wind interaction with planets and moons;
- inter-comparisons of planetary environments;
- observations of space weather effects from space probes and
  Earth-based instrumentation;
- theoretical modeling and simulations, especially in view of
  measurement analysis and interpretation;
- potential impacts of space weathering on technological space systems.

EGU 2020 SESSION PS4.2: MARS SCIENCE AND EXPLORATION 

We would like you to invite to submit an abstract to the session PS4.2:
"Mars Science and Exploration" of the EGU2020 to be held in Vienna on
May 3-8, 2020.

The deadline for the abstract submission is January 15, 2020, 13:00 CET.

With three rover launches scheduled in 2020, another giant leap in Mars
exploration is expected in the next decade. In this session, we welcome
contributions about lessons learned from past/current missions,
terrestrial analog studies, as well as future exploration and
prospects.

LUNAR SURFACE SCIENCE WORKSHOP: SAVE THE DATE

NASA is planning a human return to the Moon's surface by 2024 as a 
large next step in human exploration of the Solar System.

NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Human Exploration and Operations
Mission Directorate, and Science and Technology Mission Directorate are
co-sponsoring a three-day workshop to actively engage the scientific
community in order to determine what science could be done by human
crews on the lunar surface and how it can be achieved. This workshop
will be held April 28-30, 2020 in the Denver, Colorado area.
