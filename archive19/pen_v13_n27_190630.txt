AGU SESSION P013: FINDING, EXPLORING AND CHARACTERIZING TERRESTRIAL 
EXOPLANETS: THE NEXT FRONTIER

We are pleased to invite you to submit an abstract for the following 
session at the 2019 AGU Fall Meeting in San Francisco, CA, December 
9-13, 2019. 

This session is a discussion of the potential of new and future 
facilities and modeling efforts designed to detect, image and 
characterize Earth-size and super-Earth terrestrial exoplanets, 
studying their formation, evolution and also the existence of possible 
biospheres. Topics to be covered in this session include instrument 
requirements and technologies to detect these exoplanets; strategies 
for target selection and prioritization; signs of exoplanet 
habitability and global biosignatures that can be sought with upcoming 
instrumentation; impacts of planetary system properties; and future 
ground-based and space telescope architectures.

The submission deadline is Wednesday, July 31, 2019.

Conveners:
Franck Marchis (SETI Institute)
Ramses Ramirez (Tokyo Institute of Technology)
Douglas A. Caldwell (SETI Institute)

AGU SESSION SM027: MOON-PLASMA INTERACTIONS THROUGHOUT THE SOLAR SYSTEM

We cordially invite you to submit an abstract to the Moon-Plasma 
Interactions Throughout the Solar System Session at the 2019 AGU Fall 
Meeting.

This session is Co-Organized with Planetary Sciences.

https://agu.confex.com/agu/fm19/prelim.cgi/Session/71232

This session focuses on observational and theoretical studies of the 
interaction between the moons of our solar system and the magnetized 
plasmas incident upon them. This includes plasma interactions with the 
solid surfaces, atmospheres, dust environments, and intrinsic/induced 
magnetic fields of the moons, both inside and outside of their parent 
planets' magnetospheres. Of special interest are results related to 
in-situ field and particle measurements near the terrestrial moon and 
from Cassini's flybys of Saturn's icy satellites Enceladus, Rhea and 
Dione. Studies deepening our understanding of the interconnection 
between Titan's ionosphere and its highly dynamic magnetospheric 
environment are also very welcome. The interaction of Jupiter's moons 
with the ambient magnetospheric plasma will be addressed with a view to
provide support to the ongoing Juno Mission and the planning of 
synergistic measurements for the upcoming JUICE and Europa Clipper 
missions. Comparative studies of the various moon-plasma interaction 
scenarios are particularly welcome.

Conveners: Lucas Liuzzo, Sven Simon, Lorenz Roth, Aljona Blocker

AGU SESSION P005: CARBON ACROSS THE SOLAR SYSTEM

We invite abstracts for the following session at the 2019 AGU Fall 
Meeting in San Francisco, CA, December 9-13, 2019.

Recent results ranging from the Kuiper Belt, the Pluto system, the 
Saturn system, other locations beyond ~5 AU, all the way to Mercury in 
the inner Solar System, and nearly all points in between, raise 
questions about the state of carbon in the Solar System: how do 
carbonaceous compounds become weathered in response to thermal 
processes and irradiation? How do we recognize carbon compounds and 
their various weathering products? The syntheses of these results 
improve our scientific understanding of the role of carbon in the Solar 
System, how it evolves and how to recognize it. The carbonaceous 
near-Earth asteroids 162173 Ryugu and 101955 Bennu are now being 
visited and sampled; the analyses of these samples will provide context 
for the presence of carbon. In this session, abstracts covering 
observational, laboratory and modeling work related to carbon and 
carbonaceous species on Solar System bodies are welcome.

The deadline for abstract submissions is Wednesday, 31 July, 23:59 EDT

Conveners: Faith Vilas (PSI, fvilas@psi.edu), Amanda R. Hendrix (PSI), 
Yvonne J. Pendleton (NASA ARC)

ESA RESEARCH FELLOWSHIPS IN SPACE SCIENCE

The European Space Agency awards several postdoctoral fellowships each 
year. The aim of these fellowships is to provide scientists in their 
early career, holding a PhD or the equivalent degree, with the means of 
performing research in fields related to the ESA Science Programme. 

Areas of research include planetary science, astronomy and 
astrophysics, solar and solar-terrestrial science, plasma physics and
fundamental physics. The fellowships have a duration of two years, with 
the possible extension to three years, and are tenable at the European 
Space Research and Technology Centre (ESTEC) in Noordwijk, Netherlands, 
or at the European Space Astronomy Centre (ESAC) in Villafranca del 
Castillo, near Madrid, Spain.

Applications are now solicited for fellowships to begin in the fall of 
2020. Candidates not holding a Ph.D. yet are encouraged to apply, but 
they must provide evidence of receiving their degree before starting 
the fellowship.

The deadline for applications is 1 October 2019.

ESA fellows are enrolled in ESA's Social Security Scheme, which covers
medical expenses. A monthly deduction covers these short-term and 
long-term risks.

Questions can be sent to the fellowship coordinators, Dr. Oliver 
Jennrich or Dr. Jan-Uwe Ness at: fellowship@cosmos.esa.int

POSTDOCTORAL POSITION IN MODELING FATE OF VOLATILES DURING ACCRETION 
OF ROCKY PLANETS

The CLEVER Planets (Cycles of Life-Essential Volatile Elements in Rocky 
Planets) team and Department of Earth, Environmental and Planetary 
Sciences at Rice University are seeking applicants for a postdoctoral 
scholar position who would explore dynamical and geochemical 
fingerprints of accretion and magma ocean processes, searching for 
conditions of producing thermo-chemically habitable rocky planets. The 
focus will be tracking the fate of life-essential volatile elements, C, 
N, H, and S in our Solar System and other exoplanetary systems from the 
protoplanetary disk to the end of magma ocean stage via dynamical and 
geochemical modeling. The contract will be initially for 1 year and is 
renewable for up to 3 years based on progress and performance. The 
salary would commensurate with experience. The position will be based 
out of Rice University but the post-doctoral candidate will also have 
the opportunity to interact with astrophysicist and planetary scientist 
at UCLA and UC Davis and other team members and collaborators.

ROCKY EXOPLANETS IN THE ERA OF JWST: THEORY AND OBSERVATION

We'd like to announce the 2nd Annual NASA Goddard SEEC Symposium, 
titled "Rocky Exoplanets in the Era of JWST: Theory and Observation", 
held November 4-8, 2019 at NASA Goddard in Greenbelt, Maryland, USA.

The goal of this meeting is to bring together theorists and observers 
interested in rocky exoplanets from across the exoplanet and planetary 
community, and related fields, to help prepare for the first 
light of the James Webb Space Telescope era by framing the key 
questions about these worlds and the exciting new observations that 
will help us characterize them.

The workshop will include invited overview talks combined with short 
research presentations, and ample time for group discussion and 
collaborative work sessions. For the list of session topics and 
current invited speakers list: 

https://seec.gsfc.nasa.gov/Symposium.html

The website for Registration and Abstracts for combined poster + flash 
talks will open at the beginning of August. Attendance is space limited 
(max 150 attendees), so please check the meeting's webpage and 
pre-register now. We will alert pre-registrants first when the full 
registration and abstract submission pages are available.

NASA'S EXPLORATION SCIENCE FORUM PROGRAM NOW ONLINE

The Solar System Exploration Research Institute (SSERVI) is pleased to 
announce that the draft NESF schedule is now posted at:

https://nesf2019.arc.nasa.gov/program

The 6th annual NASA Exploration Science Forum (NESF) will be held in 
person July 23-25, 2019 at NASA Ames Research Center, Moffett Field, 
CA. This year's Forum will feature scientific discussions of human 
exploration targets of interest (the Moon, near-Earth asteroids, and 
the moons of Mars). Science sessions will focus on recent mission 
results and in-depth analyses of science and exploration studies. 
Dedicated side-conferences for graduate students and young 
professionals will coincide with the ESF. Public engagement 
discussions will be interwoven among science topics as well. 

This year marks the 50th anniversary of the Apollo 11 splashdown, and 
on July 24 SSERVI will bus interested Forum attendees to the USS 
Hornet, the US aircraft carrier that recovered the Apollo 11 crew and 
capsule, for a special program. All Forum attendees are welcome to 
join. Please indicate your interest on the registration page if you 
would like to attend this exciting Apollo 11 50th anniversary event!
