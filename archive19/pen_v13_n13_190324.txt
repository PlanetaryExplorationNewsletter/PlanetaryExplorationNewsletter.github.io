GOLDSCHMIDT 2019 SESSION: ICY WATERWORLDS - GEOCHEMISTRY OF SUBSURFACE
OCEANS IN THE SOLAR SYSTEM

August 18-23
Barcelona, Spain 
Abstract submission deadline: March 29

Session 01c at the following link: 

https://goldschmidt.info/2019/program/programViewThemes

The discovery of vast liquid water oceans under the icy surfaces of 
moons in the outer Solar System has defined a new priority in planetary 
exploration. Understanding these oceans will reveal fundamental 
insights into aqueous geochemistry in the universe, the role of 
water/rock interaction in planetary evolution, and possibly the origins 
of life. This session will explore current state of knowledge and 
pressing questions for constraining the chemistry and habitability of 
these oceans. We are looking to attract a broad range of investigators, 
and welcome submission covering: icy moon ocean evolution, water-rock 
interaction, water-ice interaction, cryovolcanism, the delivery of 
material to the surface of icy moons or the remote detection of 
ocean-derived material from Earth or spacecraft-based observation. 
Chris Glein from Southwest Research Institute will deliver a keynote 
talk, titled 'Alien Oceans as a New Frontier for Geochemistry'. The 
deadline for abstract submissions is the 29th March. Come and join us 
in Barcelona!

ABSTRACT SUBMISSION OPEN FOR THE 2ND RPI SPACE IMAGING WORKSHOP

We invite extended abstracts (due April 26, 2019) for the RPI Space 
Imaging Workshop. The workshop, which addresses all aspects of science 
and exploration with space imagery, will be held 28-30 October 2019 in 
Saratoga Springs, NY. More details and the abstract submission webform 
may be found online at: 

http://seal.rpi.edu/workshop/2019  

Although images of space objects have been used for decades, there are 
many common challenges in the use of image data for planetary science, 
optical navigation, and space situational awareness. This workshop aims 
to facilitate the dissemination of ideas between all of the communities 
using space image data and to identify areas of common need. The 
workshop program includes: technical papers and posters, student paper 
competition, focused breakout sessions, keynote talks from Dr. Andrew 
Johnson (JPL) and Dr. Carter Emmart (AMNH), and a short course on space 
image processing with MATLAB taught by instructors from MathWorks.

The workshop is organized by Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI) in 
Troy, NY, and is co-sponsored by the American Astronautical Society 
(AAS).

EPSC-DPS SESSION SB4: PLANETESIMALS - PRIMITIVE AND DIFFERENTIATED
SMALL BODIES, INCLUDING VESTA AND CERES AS SEEN AFTER THE DAWN MISSION

This session welcomes contributions addressing asteroid science 
primarily building on data from the Dawn and other spacecraft missions, 
along with complementary observations from ground and space telescopic 
assets. Studies on the composition, geological properties, surface and 
internal processes of Vesta, Ceres, and other Main Belt asteroids in 
general are encouraged. We also foster studies on the formation of 
planetesimals, their differentiation, and further evolution, including 
their collisional break-up and creation of families of new generation 
asteroids. Contributions shedding new light on the processes driving 
asteroid accretion, evolution, and the information they bring to early 
Solar System history, are also welcomed. This session aims to provide 
an update on the state of knowledge of the Main Belt.

The abstract submission deadline is May 8, 2019, 13:00 CEST:

EPSC-DPS SESSION SB8: LATEST SCIENCE RESULTS IN PLANETARY DEFENSE

We would like to invite you to send an abstract to Session SB8, "Latest 
Science Results in Planetary Defence" at the EPSC-DPS Joint Meeting on 
September 15-20, 2019 in Geneva.

Abstracts are invited covering all aspects of planetary defense: 
Results from space and ground based telescopic data, results from past 
and ongoing missions that are relevant for planetary defence as well as 
updates of planned missions that will significantly contribute and 
enhance the scientific knowledge for the global planetary defence 
strategy are welcome.

More information about the session and a link to abstract submission 
can be found at:

ANNOUNCING THE 2019 NASA PLANETARY VOLCANOLOGY WORKSHOP IN HAWAII:
ANALOGS TO VOLCANIC FEATURES AND PROCESSES IN SATELLITE AND ROVER 
IMAGES

July 11-17, 2019 

This NASA-sponsored workshop will provide field-based experience on 
Hawaiian volcanoes. We will study volcanic features analogous to those 
on Mars that have been imaged recently by orbiter and rover missions, 
comparing their field characteristics to their appearance in 
remotely-sensed images. The workshop is intended for NASA-funded 
senior graduate students who are currently working on volcanology 
problems on Mars (or any other planet besides Earth), but are in need 
of field experience on volcanoes.

All expenses, including travel, will be covered on a reimbursement 
basis. Please note that although U.S. citizenship is not required, all 
applicants MUST be students or employees at a U.S. University or 
Institution, AND their current study or work must be funded by a NASA 
planetary research program. Because space is limited, preference will 
be given to graduate students, but post-docs may also be accepted. 
Previous Planetary Volcanology Workshop participants cannot be 
considered. 

For more information and application instructions, please contact 
Sarah Fagents (fagents@hawaii.edu, 808-956-3163).

Application deadline is April 22, 2019.

Trip leaders: Scott Rowland, Pete Mouginis-Mark, and Sarah Fagents

FIRST ANNOUNCEMENT: ICE GIANT SYSTEMS 2020

January 20-22, 2020 
Royal Society, London

Overview: New and ambitious missions to the distant Ice Giants and 
their satellites will become a key element of our Solar System 
exploration in the coming decades.

Format: The meeting will consist of two days of invited plenary talks 
and a third day of splinter workshops, aiming to showcase the cutting 
edge of Ice Giant system research and the rationale for a return to 
Uranus and Neptune. Plenaries and splinter workshops will be summarised 
in a special issue of Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society 
A, reviewing state-of-the-art knowledge of the Ice Giant Systems. Go 
to: 

http://ice-giants.github.io

Funding: The plenary discussion meeting is free to attend, sponsored by 
the Royal Society. A small fee will be levied for the splinter 
meetings. The early announcement of the meeting date should allow 
contributors to seek funding for travel and accommodation in London 
- US participants might consider the AAS international travel grant 
program (deadline in June 2019); UK participants could look to the 
Royal Astronomical Society travel grants (deadline in August 2019).

Registration and Abstracts: A second announcement will be circulated 
when the registration and abstract submission portals are open.

DWORNIK AWARD GOFUNDME CAMPAIGN

The Planetary Geology Division (PGD) of GSA has started a GoFundMe 
campaign to raise $15,000 to help support the annual Dwornik Award. The 
Dwornik Award recognizes outstanding graduate and undergraduate student 
presentations (in both poster and oral categories) at the Lunar and 
Planetary Science Conference (LPSC) each year. As the number of 
students entering into the planetary field has increased, the 
competitiveness of this award has also increased. In order to keep pace 
with this increasing number, as well as with inflation, the PGD, under
consultation with the GSA Foundation, aims to secure the future of the 
Dwornik Award and make it self-sustaining. To do that requires your 
help and we humbly ask that you consider contributing to help us reach 
our $15,000 goal. To make a contribution or to learn more about this 
campaign, the Dwornik Award, and Stephen E. Dwornik himself, please 
visit:

https://www.gofundme.com/dwornik-award-fund?member=1834286

We thank you in advance for any contribution you can make to help us 
reach this important goal. If you have any questions about this 
campaign or the Dwornik Award, please do not hesitate to reach out to 
myself or any of the PGD officers.

Sincerely,
Nick Lang, PGD Secretary-Treasurer
