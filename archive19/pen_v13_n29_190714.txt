HORIZON 2061 SYNTHESIS WORKSHOP

The Third Circular of the "Horizon 2061 synthesis workshop" will be
organized by IRAP and OMP in Toulouse from September 11-13, 2019. The
objectives, contents and components of the "Planetary Science, Horizon
2061" long-term foresight exercise are presented in our conference
website:

https://h2061-tlse.sciencesconf.org/

The main objective of the Horizon 2061 long-term community foresight 
exercise is to progressively build with YOUR inputs and YOUR ideas the 
contours of the four "pillars" of planetary exploration:

- the important science questions that planetary exploration addresses;

- the broad spectrum of space missions that need to be flown to address 
these science questions;

- the enabling technologies that we will need to master in the coming 
decades to fly these missions;

- the technical infrastructures and services, space-based and 
ground-based, that will be needed to support the planetary exploration 
missions and maximize their science return.

We have chosen to schedule our workshop just before the EPSC-DPS
meeting in Geneva (September 16-20). Travel from Toulouse to Geneva can
be done in one-hour direct flights, which should facilitate
participation in the two events and decrease travel costs.

AGU SESSION EP002: ADVANCES IN UNCREWED AERIAL VEHICLE (UAV) USE FOR
EARTH AND PLANETARY OBSERVATION

We are pleased to invite abstract submissions for the following session
at the 2019 AGU Fall Meeting in San Francisco, CA, December 9-13, 2019.

Uncrewed (or unmanned) aerial vehicles (UAVs) present new opportunities
for standoff sampling and measurement, close range remote sensing, and
detailed reconstruction of Earth and planetary surfaces. UAVs drive
innovative studies in many disciplines, targeting a range of
challenging environments. New platforms, sensors, operational
approaches, and data analysis techniques drive the growing potential of
UAVs in high impact, and often low cost, Earth and planetary science
research. This session will highlight novel UAV-based studies,
especially those using new workflows to address operational,
sensor fusion, and data reduction obstacles. We encourage submissions
that describe novel work in any of the following areas: (1)
applications of UAVs within Earth and planetary science; (2) platforms,
sensors, measurement techniques, and operational approaches for
UAV-driven studies; (3) post-processing workflows, data management
practices, and computational tools that focus UAV data analysis; or (4)
methods for visualization and communication of UAV-based science
results.

AGU SESSION SM024: MAGNETOSPHERES IN THE OUTER SOLAR SYSTEM 

Conveners: Xianzhe Jia, Chris Paranicas and George Hospodarsky

This session invites abstracts covering the structure and dynamics of
the magnetospheres of the giant planets (Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and
Neptune) as well as Ganymede. Papers on magnetospheric and auroral
processes including magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling, plasma
transport, tail dynamics, rotational modulations, magnetospheric
boundaries, and the role of the solar wind are consistent with our
session themes. We particularly encourage submissions that compare the
giant planet magnetospheres to one another, or compare them to those of
terrestrial planets. The session will be an ideal forum for the
discussion of recent advances in our understanding of all these systems
enabled by in-situ and remote observations as well as theoretical and
numerical modeling.

AGU SESSION P005: CARBON ACROSS THE SOLAR SYSTEM

We invite abstracts for the following session at the 2019 AGU Fall
Meeting in San Francisco, CA, December 9-13, 2019.

Recent results ranging from the Kuiper Belt, the Pluto system, the
Saturn system, other locations beyond ~5 AU, all the way to Mercury in
the inner Solar System, and nearly all points in between, raise
questions about the state of carbon in the Solar System: how do
carbonaceous compounds become weathered in response to thermal
processes and irradiation? How do we recognize carbon compounds and
their various weathering products? The syntheses of these results
improve our scientific understanding of the role of carbon in the Solar
System, how it evolves and how to recognize it. The carbonaceous
near-Earth asteroids 162173 Ryugu and 101955 Bennu are now being
visited and sampled; the analyses of these samples will provide context
for the presence of carbon. In this session, abstracts covering
observational, laboratory and modeling work related to carbon and
carbonaceous species on Solar System bodies are welcome.

Deadline for abstract submissions: Wednesday, 31 July, 23:59 EDT

AGU SESSION P023: MARS SAMPLE RETURN

Balancing the Benefits of a New Phase of Mars Exploration Against
Potential Risks to Earth, While Communicating Both to the Public 

San Francisco, Dec 9-13, 2019

In a mission sequence beginning in 2020, NASA and partners plan to
assemble martian samples for possible future return, potentially
exposing the Earth to relatively fresh material from Mars. Mars samples
will be scientifically selected, and stored there for later pick-up.
Sample-return mission partners are studying a joint endeavor that would
open Mars as a two-way field site for further study. This session will
examine a future MSR campaign, with NASA as systems architect and the
lead on an MSR Lander (SRL) mission, and ESA as the lead on an MSR
Orbiter mission, providing a Sample Fetch Rover and the Sample Transfer
Arm for the SRL. The NASA-provided Sample Capture, Handling, and
Containment system and Earth Entry Vehicle would be mounted on the
Orbiter, and with a sample receiving facility will be essential to
protecting the Earth from sample-exposure risks. Effective public
communication will be essential to mission success.

Please consider submitting to this session and feel free to pass the
information along to anyone you think might be interested. 

Abstracts are due by July 31, 23:59 EDT

AGU SESSION P024: MERCURY - THE CONTINUING AND FUTURE EXPLORATION OF
THE INNERMOST PLANET

We are pleased to announce a session on Mercury at the 2019 AGU Fall
Meeting in San Francisco, CA, December 9-13, 2019.

NASA's MESSENGER mission revolutionized our understanding of Mercury's
surface, interior, exosphere, and magnetosphere. With the successful
launch of the ESA-JAXA BepiColombo dual spacecraft mission to Mercury
in October 2018, that understanding will soon take another substantial
step forward. In this session, we welcome papers on data analysis,
laboratory measurements, ground-based observations, and theoretical
developments that build on the current state of knowledge of Mercury,
as well as contributions on Mercury-like exoplanets. We particularly
welcome papers on how questions raised by MESSENGER findings can be
addressed by future observations expected from BepiColombo.

Please consider submitting an abstract for this session. For more
information, visit:

TECHNOLOGIES, AND CONSIDERATIONS FOR ACCESSING OCEAN WORLD INTERIORS
 
Conveners: Samuel Howell (samuel.m.howell@jpl.nasa.gov), Kris Zacny,
Christine McCarthy, Patrick Gasda
 
Are you interested in getting into the oceans of icy satellites or
beneath Earth's ice sheets? The icy interiors and oceans of Ocean
Worlds are of great astrobiological potential, and may provide unique
insight into the geologic and geochemical evolution of planetary ice
formations. In this session we welcome studies related to ice
penetration and ocean access on all Ocean Worlds, including Earth, that
illuminate potential science and instrumentation, subsurface
exploration, and of particular interest, ongoing architecture and
technology development efforts for enabling subsurface exploration.

AGU SESSION P033: SEDIMENTARY VOLCANISM, DIAPIRISM, AND LIQUEFACTION IN
THE SOLAR SYSTEM

We would like to invite submissions to our AGU session this fall in San
Francisco:

https://agu.confex.com/agu/fm19/prelim.cgi/Session/76580

A growing body of research aided by recent orbital observations has
begun to address the presence of widespread sedimentary volcanic
morphologies on Mars and other bodies. Proposed mud volcanism,
sedimentary diapirism, and liquefaction morphologies are supported by
observations of pitted cones, flows, and injectites, vacuum chamber
experiments, and Earth analog comparison. We solicit contributed papers
on data analysis, laboratory measurements, ground-based observations,
and theoretical developments that build on the current state of
knowledge of sedimentary volcanism on Mars and in the Solar System.

AGU SESSION P035: THE EVOLUTION OF VENUS AND VENUS-LIKE EXOPLANETS

We are pleased to invite you to submit an abstract for the following
session at the 2019 AGU Fall Meeting in San Francisco, CA, December
9-13, 2019.

Today Venus appears to be hostile and uninhabitable. However, recent
studies have shown that its climate evolution is complex and could
permit early habitable conditions (e.g. Way et al. 2016). Other recent
studies of Magellan imagery have demonstrated the possibility that many
tesserae on Venus are some of the oldest geological surface units
visible today (e.g. Gilmore et al. 2017) and may predate much of the
near-global resurfacing. The idea that Venus is a static single plate
planet has also come into question with the studies of Davaille et al.
2017 and Byrne et al. 2018. All of these studies have implications for
the understanding of Venus-like Exoplanets (Kane et al. 2014) to be
discovered in the near term. This session will explore recent advances
in understanding the evolution of Venus and Venus-like exoplanets and
how they may inform each other.

AGU SESSION P036: THE INTERIORS OF JUPITER AND SATURN IN THE ERA OF
JUNO AND CASSINI
 
Constraining the present-day interior structure and dynamics of giant
planets is critical to understanding the formation and evolution of
planets in our Solar System and beyond. Both the ongoing Juno mission
and the recently concluded Cassini mission have provided a wealth of
new measurements, revealing key aspects of the interiors of Jupiter and
Saturn for the first time. This session will bring together both
observations and theoretical interpretations to improve our
understanding of giant planet interiors.

We welcome submissions on wide range of interior topics, including:
gravity science; strong differential rotation (zonal flows); properties
of intrinsic (dynamo) magnetic fields; the existence and properties of
the central core; seismic, thermal, and magnetic consequences of stable
stratification; normal modes; bulk composition (including helium and
heavy element abundance); as well as formation scenarios and
evolutionary pathways.

AGU SESSION P037: THE KUIPER BELT CAPTAIN'S TALE - NASA'S NEW HORIZONS
EXPLORES THE PLUTO SYSTEM, 2014 MU69 ("ULTIMA THULE"), AND BEYOND

Conveners: Chiristina Dalle Ore, Jeff Moore, Hal Weaver

New Horizons, outbound from its successful encounter with Pluto,
Charon, and four smaller moons, reached Kuiper belt object (486958)
2014 MU69 on 1 Jan 2019. Just as Pluto was found to be remarkably
geologically active for a small, cold, distant planet, 2014 MU69 proved
to be, in its own way, a revelation. Formed of two contrasting lobes,
apparently gently merged in the earliest days of the Solar System,
"Ultima Thule" is providing detailed insights into the conditions and
processes of planetesimal formation. This session encourages
submissions on analysis and modeling of Pluto system data from the 2015
encounter, presentation of new data from the Ultima Thule encounter,
along with emerging understanding of planetesimal formation and
evolution. Submissions are also encouraged on Kuiper belt science
generally, including Earth-based observations, theoretical modeling,
New Horizons observations of other KBOs and the heliosphere, and plans
for future exploration of the Solar System's 3rd zone.

AGU SESSION P038: THE NEW MARS UNDERGROUND 2.0

After last year's highly successful "The New Mars Underground" session,
we look forward to seeing again many abstracts focusing on the Martian
subsurface: its properties, processes and prospects for life, ancient
and modern, across science, enabling technologies and mission
concepts.

The Martian crustal subsurface encompasses a wide range of environments
at depths from ~centimeters to kilometers. These environments are
relatively unexplored but are of enormous interest for planetary
science. Recent results, e.g., methane fluctuations, radar data that
are consistent with liquid subsurface water, and ongoing debates on
RSL, all point to dynamic subsurface environments. We invite
contributions that address the nature and diversity of Mars crustal
subsurface environments (modeling, experiments, observations) or
develop the tools/missions for exploring them (sounding, access, in
situ analysis). We are particularly interested in contributions that
advance our understanding of how the subsurface changes with geographic
location and depth, in respect to: volatiles such as brines, ices,
clathrates, salts, methane and oxidants, the potential for extant life
and the preservation of signs of extinct life, the redox potential of
past and present environments, and the technologies/mission concepts
that enable such subsurface exploration.

AGU SESSION P039: THE URANUS AND NEPTUNE SYSTEMS, AND THEIR RELATION TO
OTHER PLANETS

https://agu.confex.com/agu/fm19/prelim.cgi/Session/81002

Uranus and Neptune systems are high-priority targets for near-future 
exploration by orbiter and/or flyby missions that may accompany in situ 
probes and landers. We aim to hold a highly interdisciplinary session 
that advances the state of the art in our understanding of all aspects 
of ice-giant systems: the magnetospheres, satellites, rings, 
atmospheres, and interiors of Uranus and Neptune; their formation and 
evolution; and their relation to other planets in and beyond our solar 
system. Our session especially welcomes presentations that advance our 
understanding of the Ice Giant systems in preparation for future remote 
sensing and in situ explorations. We solicit presentations on 
observations, modeling, theory and laboratory work, as well as concepts 
for missions and instruments relevant for future exploration of the Ice 
Giant Systems.
