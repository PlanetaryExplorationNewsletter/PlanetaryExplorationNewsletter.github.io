[NASA] ROSES: CHANGES TO C.31 KPLO PSP TEXT AND DUE DATES

The objective of the Korea Pathfinder Lunar Orbiter (KPLO) 
Participating Scientist Program (PSP) is to enhance the scientific 
return during the science phase of the KPLO mission by expanding 
participation in the mission through new investigations that 1) broaden 
or complement existing mission investigations, or 2) leverage the KPLO 
mission data for studies outside of the original mission scope.

This amendment makes many changes to the text of this program element
including at least one significant change in scope (Section 4.2), as
well as corrections, updates and clarifications of technical
parameters. The due dates have been deferred to permit proposers time
to adjust their proposal plans. New text is in bold and deleted text is
struck through. Step-1 proposals are now due April 11, 2019 and Step-2
proposals are due June 11, 2019.

[NASA] ROSES: C.30 PMCS CORRECTION AND DUE DATE DELAY

This amendment corrects criteria and delays due dates for program 
element C.30 Planetary Mission Concept Studies.

NASA has started preparations for the 2023 Planetary Science Decadal 
Survey and one of the tasks of the 2023 Decadal Survey Committee will 
be to recommend a portfolio of planetary science missions. To this 
end, NASA is soliciting proposals to conduct mission concept studies 
in planetary science. Results of the selected studies will be provided 
by NASA as input to the 2023 Decadal Survey.

In program element, C.30 Planetary Mission Concept Studies, the wording 
regarding the evaluation of Merit and Relevance in Section 3.1 Proposal 
Evaluation, has been corrected to remove redundancy and more clearly 
explain the factors for peer review. New text is in bold and deleted 
text is struck through. Mandatory NOIs are now due by April 1, 2019, 
and the due date for 15-page proposals is May 31, 2019. Also, a FAQ has 
been posted on the NSPIRES web page for this program element.

EXPRESSION OF INTEREST FOR THE AHEARN SYMPOSIUM

We are working to gauge the interest in the A'Hearn Symposium. The 
meeting, entitled "New Cometary Insights from the Close Approach of 
46P/Wirtanen: A Symposium in Celebration of Mike A'Hearn" will be held 
on August 6-8, 2019 at the University of Maryland. Website at:

http://wirtanen.astro.umd.edu/46P/symposium.shtml

In Mike's honor, this symposium will focus on results from observations 
of comet 46P/Wirtanen (and other recent bright comets) to allow the 
compilation of individual studies into a comprehensive understanding of 
the comet. We encourage cometary scientists of all types as well as 
anyone who knew and worked with Mike in any capacity to come and 
participate in this event and to reflect on his legacy.

A website has been set up to determine how many people are interested 
in participating. It is located at:

SUMMER SCHOOL ON "NATURAL SPACE RISKS"

August 26-31, 2019
Paris Observatory, France

This summer school aims at providing undergraduate and master students 
with an intensive training on all Earth natural space risks. The 
programme will address space weather, space debris, near-Earth objects, 
and their societal impacts. Resilience aspects will also be tackled by 
researchers and by experts from the civil society. During this one-week 
school students will have a mix of academic lectures and hands-on 
sessions on orbitography, solar observations, and applied data 
reduction and analysis, during splinter sessions. The lectures and the 
hand-on sessions will be run by experts coming from all over Europe; 
experts from the industry will explain the importance of natural space 
risks for their activities. This school is a unique opportunity to meet 
academic and non-academic researchers at the early stage of a career.

Applications should be submitted by email to nsr-2019@sciencesconf.org 
by April 15th, 2019 (17:00 Paris time). For more information on the 
submission process please refer to:

SPICE TRAINING CLASS

A beginner's SPICE training class will be held in a hotel near 
Pasadena, California on June 4-6, 2019.

NASA's SPICE system is used for computing observation geometry for 
robotic science missions. It has been in use since the Magellan mission 
to Venus, and is now used on most worldwide planetary missions as well 
as on some heliophysics and Earth science missions. This three-day 
class is free of charge and is open to everyone involved with space 
science, including foreign nationals and commercial enterprises. 
Attendance will be limited to the first 60 registrants. Details about 
the class and the required registration form are found here:

ANNOUNCEMENT FROM OPAG STEERING COMMITTEE REGARDING TERMINATION OF 
CASSINI FINAL-YEAR FUNDING AND EUROPA CLIPPER ICEMAG

Recent decisions by NASA to terminate the Cassini final-year funding 
and the PI-led ICEMAG investigation on the Europa Clipper mission 
(replaced by a facility magnetometer investigation) raise concerns 
within the OPAG science community. The OPAG Steering Community issued 
three findings with a request for NASA's response:

1. OPAG encourages NASA to invite the Committee on Astrobiology and 
Planetary Science (CAPS) of the National Academies to investigate the 
ICEMAG termination process and rationale and to potentially make 
recommendations to NASA SMD about how to define a clear and transparent 
process for potential termination of PI-led flight experiments.  
 
2. OPAG encourages NASA to provide sufficient transition funding to 
support an adequate closeout of the Cassini project that will minimize 
the impact on young scientists and other investigators who would be 
disproportionately impacted by this large, abrupt funding cut.

3. OPAG applauds the spectacular success of the Cassini mission at 
Saturn and asks NASA to adequately support CDAP to ensure optimum 
science output from this mission. 

The full Findings on Cassini and ICEMAG can be found at: 

https://www.lpi.usra.edu/opag/meetings/archive/

To be discussed at the OPAG meeting on April 23-24.

NASA HEADQUARTERS POSITIONS AVAILABLE IN SMD

The Science Mission Directorate (SMD) within NASA Headquarters will 
fill multiple Program Executive positions in the Earth Science 
Division, Heliophysics Division, Planetary Science Division, 
Astrophysics Division, or Joint Agency Satellite Division.

This will be a Direct Hire Authority (DHA) announcement through 
USAJOBS, so it will only be open for 5 days. The announcement will 
open on March 25 and close on March 29. The NASA Announcement Number 
will be HQ19H0003.

This is a fair and open competition that all U.S. Citizens and Status 
candidates can apply to. The short period that the announcement is open 
is due to the type of hiring authority. The positions are NOT "rigged" 
or "fixed" for anyone. We've been asked to emphasize this because some 
applicants may have a misconception about this opportunity due to the 
very short window and we do not want anyone to be deterred from 
applying.

Given the short period the announcement is open, it is a good idea to 
log into USAJOBS before and update your resume, etc., to facilitate the 
timely submission of an application.
