COMETS III: A PROPOSED NEW VOLUME IN THE SPACE SCIENCE SERIES

Call for Expressions of Interest

A decade-and-a-half has passed since the publication of Comets II,
edited by Michel Festou, Uwe Keller, and Hal Weaver. Substantial
advancements in the field by groundbased observers, spacecraft
missions, and theoretical modelers amply motivate the organization of
Comets III as a proposed new volume in the University of Arizona Press
Space Science Series under the editorial production guidance of the
Lunar and Planetary Institute. Chapters for Comets III would be due in
2022 with the volume being published in 2023.

An open call is being made for expressions of interest to participate
in Comets III as authors, members of the scientific organizing
committee, and/or editors. To indicate your interest, download, fill
out, and submit an indication of interest form:

https://www.lpi.usra.edu/publications/books/Comets_III/

Please submit your responses no later than October 15, 2019. Questions
may be addressed to the General Editor of the Space Science Series,
Richard Binzel (rpb@mit.edu).

POST-DOCTORAL RESEARCH ASSISTANT AT THE FLORIDA SPACE INSTITUTE/
UNIVERSITY OF CENTRAL FLORIDA IN SMALL-BODY PLANETARY SCIENCES

The Florida Space Institute (FSI) at the University of Central Florida
(UCF) invites applications for a postdoctoral associate position to
carry out research on the physical processes on the surface of small
bodies such as asteroids. The position will have a start date before
November 2019 and is renewable annually for up to three years.

Minimum Qualifications: A Ph.D. from an accredited institution in
physics, astronomy, astrophysics, planetary sciences, or a related
field is required.

Preferences: Experience in the following is of interest: Hands-on
experience in hardware design, manufacturing, and operation;

Laboratory work with cryogenic samples;

Mentoring of undergraduate students;

One or more of the following coding languages: IDL, Python, C, C++,
Fortran.

EEO Employer: As an equal opportunity/affirmative action employer, UCF
encourages all qualified applicants to apply, including women,
veterans, individuals with disabilities, and members of traditionally
underrepresented populations. UCF's Equal Opportunity Statement can be
viewed at: 

http://www.oie.ucf.edu/documents/PresidentsStatement.pdf

As a Florida public university, UCF makes all application materials and
selection procedures available to the public upon request.

All applications and supporting documents should be submitted
electronically at:

[NASA] ROSES-19: MDAP DUE DATES DELAYED
 
The objective of the Mars Data Analysis Program (MDAP) is to enhance
the scientific return from missions to Mars conducted by NASA and other
space agencies. MDAP did not specifically mention Insight on the
non-exclusive list of Missions in Section 1, its inclusion was merely
implied. This Amendment explicitly adds the name of the Insight mission
to that list to allow the inclusion of Insight Mission data in
proposals to MDAP. To allow more time for proposers who were unaware
that Insight data was eligible, the MDAP due dates have been delayed as
follows: Step-1 proposals are now due by September 20, 2019 and Step-2
proposals by November 20, 2019.

GBO, NRAO, AND LBO SEEK PLANETARY SCIENTISTS FOR PROPOSAL REVIEW PANELS

The science staff at Green Bank Observatory (GBO) would like to recruit
planetary scientists to serve as proposal reviewers for GBO telescopes,
as well as telescopes operated by the National Radio Astronomy
Observatory (NRAO), and the Long Baseline Observatory (LBO). 

Proposals to GBO, NRAO, and LBO for the scientific use of radio
telescopes are evaluated on the basis of scientific merit and technical
feasibility using a panel-review system. The system aims to ensure that
scientifically knowledgeable peers, representing the broad diversity of
the community at large, provide expert proposal evaluations. 

In response to community concern that planetary science has been
under-represented on previous panels, NRAO, GBO, and LBO are
particularly welcoming volunteer panelists who are engaged in Solar
System science.

More information on the NRAO/GBO/LBO proposal review process can be
found here:
