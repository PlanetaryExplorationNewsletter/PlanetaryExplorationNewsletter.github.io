[NASA] ROSES-19: C.3 SSW ANTARCTIC FIELDWORK

C.3 Solar System Workings now allows Antarctic fieldwork and updates 
the text of Section 4.5 to include instructions regarding budgeting 
and acknowledgement in publications.

Solar System Workings (SSW) supports research into atmospheric, 
climatological, dynamical, geologic, geophysical, and geochemical 
processes occurring on planetary bodies, satellites, and other minor 
bodies (including rings) in the Solar System. Research supported by 
this call may cover a wide range of investigations including data 
synthesis relevant to the physical and chemical processes affecting 
planetary systems, laboratory studies that examine physical or 
chemical properties and processes, studies of sample or analog 
materials of other Solar System bodies, field studies of terrestrial 
analogs of planetary environments, and theoretical, analytical, and 
numerical modeling of physical or chemical processes.

The due dates remain unchanged: Notices of intent to propose are 
requested by November 15, 2019 and proposals are due January 30, 2020. 

This announcement will be posted on the NASA research opportunity 
homepage:

http://solicitation.nasaprs.com/ROSES2019 

and will appear on the RSS feed at:

Questions regarding this program element in general and this amendment 
in particular may be directed to the SSW caucus at hq-ssw@mail.nasa.gov

GSA SESSION T22: BASALTIC VOLCANISM ON EARTH AND BEYOND

We would like to draw your attention to a topical session at the 
upcoming GSA Annual Meeting (Sept 22-25) that may be of interest to 
some of you. 

Session T22, "Basaltic Volcanism on Earth and Beyond: Exploring the 
Physical Controls on Eruptive Styles and Associated Deposits", will 
gather a collection of studies that investigate the causes and 
consequences of basaltic volcanism of all styles and scales, and 
attempt to improve our understanding of the many surface expressions 
of basaltic volcanism throughout the Solar System and their associated 
deposits. 

We would like to encourage those working on issues of planetary 
volcanism to come share their results.

Invited speakers are Tracy Gregg and Bruce Houghton.

Abstracts should be submitted before June 25, 2019, at the following

POSTDOCTORAL POSITION IN PLANETARY SCIENCES (HYPERSPECTRAL IMAGERY)

The Centre de Recherches Petrographiques et Geochimiques (CRPG) Nancy, 
located in northeast France, is looking for a postdoctoral researcher 
in Earth and Planetary remote sensing. The 2-year position is supported 
by a CNRS Momentum grant entitled "Spectral imagery unravels the nature 
of planetary crusts".  

Applications are now open, until June 30, 2019. There is no restriction 
on citizenship. The position must start between September 1 and December 
15, 2019.
