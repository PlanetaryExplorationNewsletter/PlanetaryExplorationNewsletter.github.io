JOB ANNOUNCEMENT: PHOTOGRAMMETRIST

The USGS Astrogeology Science Center is looking for a Photogrammetrist
(GS-11/12 Physical Scientist). We work in coordination with NASA and
other agencies to support missions to planetary objects across the
Solar System. If you are looking for a rewarding position in the
Federal workforce and have expertise in photogrammetry and software
development, we need your help! Job duties include developing software,
algorithms, and/or guidelines for mapping planetary data; developing
planetary sensor models that define the transformation between image
space and object space; producing improved geospatial knowledge of
extraterrestrial bodies and planetary datasets (e.g., spacecraft
ephemerides, digital elevation models, orthorectified images and
mosaics, metadata, and control networks); and providing guidance to
technical staff working on photogrammetric and geodetic production
tasks. Applicants must have a bachelor's or higher degree in physical
science, engineering, or mathematics, expertise in the concepts,
theories, and principles of photogrammetry, cartography, geodesy,
and/or computer vision, and experience developing and modifying
software to apply these principles to highly varied datasets.
Applicants must be US citizens, and a background check is required.
This position is located in Flagstaff, AZ. Apply starting September 2,
2019 through USAjobs.gov announcement DEN-2019-0254.

PRESENTATIONS FROM MEPAG (VM6) NOW AVAILABLE AND COMMENTS REQUESTED BY 
PPIRB ABOUT MARS PLANETARY PROTECTION

Mars community members,

Please see the request below from Wendy Calvin (University of
Nevada-Reno), which is a follow-up to her request for feedback from
MEPAG at the recent MEPAG virtual meeting (VM6), as input to a
Planetary Protection Independent Review Board. At VM6, there was good
discussion about the current Planetary Protection policies (including
Special Regions). MEPAG /PPIRB is soliciting your input regarding:

1) Planetary protection (PP) as currently implemented for Mars
2) Suggestions for how to improve PP for Mars
3) What we need to learn or study in order to update our understanding
   of Martian "Special Regions"

Please provide your name and affiliation along with your comment. 
Responses should be input on the Google doc:

https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSe_3IZT-
06_0SGE7fyMcBMKNUDxrA87WUfwcrPO3QFp2YCanA/viewform

Feedback is requested by next Wednesday, Sept 4.

For more context of the discussion at VM6, Dave Beaty's (MPO/JPL)
presentation on this topic is available, along with all other VM6
presentations, at the meeting website:

JOB OPENING: NAIF NODE OF THE PLANETARY DATA SYSTEM

NASA's Navigation and Ancillary Information Facility (NAIF), located at
the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, is seeking a
skilled, dedicated and highly motivated professional to help develop
the "SPICE 2.0" Toolkit, a re-implementation of the existing SPICE 1.0
Toolkit family using the C++11 language with a multithreaded and
object-oriented architecture.

The job involves original design, thoughtful implementation, excellent
code documentation and provision of thorough testing facilities, all in
keeping with existing NAIF standards and practices. The applicant must
have demonstrable C++11 programming experience as well as skills in the
areas of mathematics and space dynamics. He or she must be willing to
quickly learn SPICE technology and capabilities in order to apply this
knowledge to the SPICE 2.0 development effort.

Applicants should have a degree in Engineering or Applied Mathematics,
and have several years of practical, related experience. This job is
not in the domain of computer science, but a strong aptitude for
practical computer programming is required.  U.S. citizenship or
equivalent is required.
