[NASA] ROSES-19: C.22 BEPICOLOMBO PSP REPLACED BY ESA/JAXA SOLICITATION  

BepiColombo Participating Scientists Program has been superseded by a 
joint ESA and JAXA Announcement of Opportunity that invites proposals 
for Interdisciplinary Scientists and Guest Investigators to increase 
the scientific return of the BepiColombo Mercury mission.

A mandatory letter of intent is due June 13, 2019, at 12:00pm (noon) 
CEST and proposals are due by July 15, 2019 at 12:00pm (noon) CEST. For 
the latest information, go to:

BepiColombo_IDS_AO.pdf/
e702ef1f-66f5-b11b-ea89-0adac9386bf1?t=1557413378262

The BepiColombo mission consists of two satellites launched together: 
The Mercury Planetary Orbiter (MPO) and the Mercury Magnetospheric 
Orbiter (MMO). BepiColombo is due to arrive at Mercury and begin its 
science exploitation phase in December 2025 (MPO) and April 2026 (MMO), 
respectively. The duration of the nominal science operations is one 
year.

Successful candidates will be appointed for a first period of three 
years (renewable). For more information, please refer to the ESA 
Announcement of Opportunity available at:

https://cosmos.esa.int/web/bepicolombo-ids-gi-2019.

Proposals from investigators at US organizations will require letters 
of endorsement. For NASA letters of endorsement or any other questions 
concerning this program element please contact Shoshana Weider at 
shoshana.z.weider@nasa.gov.

[NASA] UPDATE ON MISSION PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR DEVELOPMENT INITIATIVE

Dear Colleagues:

As you know, I am passionate about building effective and innovative 
teams that achieve amazing results for NASA Science. NASA Science 
recognizes and supports the benefits of having diverse and inclusive 
scientific, engineering, and technology communities and fully expects 
that such values will be reflected in the composition of all mission 
and mission proposal teams. This past November, we hosted a mission 
principal investigator diversity workshop to understand where there 
could be areas for improvement. Based on the feedback and lessons 
learned from that workshop, I would like to share with you some 
exciting opportunities that will be forthcoming later this year. I hope 
that you will take advantage of these new offerings.

Thomas H. Zurbuchen
Associate Administrator for the Science Mission Directorate
