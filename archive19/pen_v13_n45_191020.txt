EXOPLANET POSTDOCTORAL RESEARCHER, THE JOHNS HOPKINS APPLIED PHYSICS 
LABORATORY

The Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory (APL) has begun a 
strategic initiative to leverages our role as a leading organization in 
Solar System research and comparative planetology to make new and 
significant contributions in understanding the nature and diversity of 
exoplanets. As part of this strategic effort, we are looking to hire a 
postdoctoral researcher with experience in exoplanet characterization. 
They will work with our team of exoplanet and planetary scientists, 
including Kevin Stevenson, Kathleen Mandt, and many others to conduct 
research on exoplanet atmospheric characterization and Solar System 
comparative planetology. APL is a world leader in space science and 
the design, development, and operation of NASA-funded missions. Joining 
the APL team will open up opportunities to conduct ground- and 
space-based observations and to participate in work with space 
missions. 

APL provides generous salary, benefits, and promotes a culture that 
values healthy work/life balance. APL's campus is located in the 
Baltimore-Washington metro area. Apply for this position here:

[NASA] ROSES-19: AKATSUKI PARTICIPATING SCIENTIST PROGRAM

A new program element has been added to ROSES-2019: C.25 The Akatsuki 
Participating Scientist Program (PSP).

The Akatsuki PSP program aims to support and enhance the Akatsuki 
mission science objectives to understand the atmospheric circulation 
through global mapping with Akatsuki's five cameras (spanning from 
ultraviolet to infrared wavelengths) and measurements of the 
atmospheric vertical structure with radio occultation techniques. The 
systematic and continuous observations by Akatsuki should provide a 
complete dataset of the Venusian atmospheric dynamics that complements 
the observations by Venus Express and prior missions to Venus.

Mandatory Notices of Intent are required by November 22, 2019 and 
proposals are due January 31, 2020. Proposals that are not preceded by 
a Notice of Intent will be returned without review.

Questions concerning this program element may be directed to Adriana 
Ocampo at aco@nasa.gov and Lucas Paganini at lucas.paganini@nasa.gov.

[NASA] ROSES-19: TESS CYCLE 3 FINAL TEXT AND DUE DATE

The Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) Guest Investigator 
Program solicits proposals for the acquisition and analysis of 
scientific data from the TESS mission, a NASA Explorer mission that 
was launched in April 2018 and began science operations in July 2018. 
Additionally, proposals that support the acquisition and analysis of 
scientific data from ground-based telescopes are solicited. Such 
ground-based measurements must directly support the analysis and/or 
interpretation of TESS scientific data.

Phase-1 proposals are due by 4:30 p.m. Eastern Time on January 16, 
2020 (via ARK/RPS).

[NASA] ROSES-19: RELEASE OF DRAFT TEXT FOR E.5 APPLIED INFORMATION
SYSTEMS RESEARCH - AUTONOMOUS ROBOTICS RESEARCH FOR OCEAN WORLDS

The Applied Information Systems Research (AISR) program seeks 
innovative ideas for applying advanced information and related 
technologies to increase life cycle effectiveness and efficiency of 
SMD programs. This draft for community comment is for an instance 
called Autonomous Robotics Research for Ocean Worlds (ARROW) to develop 
autonomy software systems to significantly increase the robustness and 
productivity of future Ocean Worlds lander missions.

Specifically, ARROW would seek functional and system-level autonomous 
capabilities for future Ocean Worlds lander missions that:
 
a) increase the productivity of surface science operations;
b) reduce the frequency of ground control contact and uplink/downlink 
   command cycles necessary for surface science operations; and
c) enable autonomous adaptation to spacecraft faults, degradations, 
   failures or other unexpected conditions.

This program would not solicit technology for a flight opportunity. 
proposers will be required to test and demonstrate the developed 
technology using testbeds (see Section 2.3) developed and supported 
by NASA.

Comments on the draft text are due by November 18, 2019 via email to 
cmercer@nasa.gov. Go to:

http://solicitation.nasaprs.com/ROSES2019 

Point of contact concerning this program is Carolyn Mercer who may be 
reached at cmercer@nasa.gov.

EGU 2020 SESSION: EXTRA-TERRESTRIAL SEDIMENTOLOGY, STRATIGRAPHY AND 
TERRESTRIAL ANALOGUES

EGU 2020 will be held in Vienna from May 3-8, 2020.

Abstract submission is from October 15, 2019, to January 15, 2020, 
13:00 CET or, for those applying for EGU Roland Schlich travel support, 
December 1, 2019, 13:00 CET.

In the past two decades, the level of robotic exploration of other 
planetary bodies has been unprecedented. What is ubiquitous in 
virtually all missions is that evidence for sedimentary processes have 
been identified on each planetary body visited, based on observations 
of geomorphic features and stratigraphy. Sedimentology will be key for 
underpinning our understanding of planetary processes, and guiding the 
missions toward their goal. This session invites any contribution 
towards any celestial body, visited by a mission, (Venus, Mars, Titan, 
Pluto and 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko), using all techniques, such as 
sedimentology, geochemistry, spectral imaging. In addition to the 
classic contributions, we particularly welcome presentations that 
utilise appropriate Earth analogues, both modern and ancient and/or 
laboratory/numerical simulation.
