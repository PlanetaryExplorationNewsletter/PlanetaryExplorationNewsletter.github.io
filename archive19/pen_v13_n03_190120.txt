UPDATE ON OPAG MEETING PLANNING

Due to the ongoing US Government Shutdown, the OPAG Steering Committee
has decided to postpone the next OPAG meeting, which was originally
planned for February 5-6 at NASA Headquarters.

We are currently tentatively planning to have the meeting on 
April 23-24 in the Washington DC area.

Please stay tuned to various planetary science news letters and the 
OPAG website for future updates. Watch:

SOLICITING ABSTRACTS FOR THE JAPAN GEOSCIENCE UNION (JPGU) MEETING

At the Japanese Geoscience Union meeting near Tokyo, Japan, we will
convene an international session titled: "Outer Solar System
Exploration Today and Tomorrow"

http://www.jpgu.org/meeting_e2019/SessionList_en/detail/P-PS01.html

We invite abstracts that address a wide range of topics encompassing
the giant planets and their moons, including their origins, interiors,
atmospheres, compositions, surface features, and electromagnetic
fields. To advocate for current and future outer planets exploration
(Cassini, Juno, New Horizons, JUICE, and beyond), we also call for
discussions on future missions to explore giant planet systems,   
including how to develop better international cooperation. Discussion
in this latter category will include progress in developing a solar
sail mission concept for observing the Jupiter system and its trojan
asteroids.

JpGU will be held on May 26-30, 2019 in Makuhari, Chiba, Japan

http://www.jpgu.org/meeting_e2019/index.php

Early Abstract deadline (discounted rate): February 4th, 2019
Regular Abstract Deadline: February 19th, 2019
Early Registration Deadline: May 8, 2018
(Note: Dates are in Japan Standard Time.

Current AGU Members can register at the JpGU member rate.

ASSISTANT PROFESSOR IN SPACE PLASMA PHYSICS AT THE UNIVERSITY OF 
COLORADO BOULDER

The University of Colorado Boulder (UC Boulder) is conducting a search 
for a faculty member at the Assistant Professor rank. We are accepting 
applications from candidates in the area of space plasma physics 
including, but not limited to, the Earth's and planetary 
magnetospheres, solar wind, and ionospheres. For more information, 
please see posting #15519 at:

MICROSYMPOSIUM 60: FORWARD TO THE MOON TO STAY - UNDERTAKING 
TRANSFORMATIVE LUNAR SCIENCE WITH COMMERCIAL PARTERS

March 16-17, 2019

The Woodlands Waterway Marriott Hotel and Convention Center

We can now identify transformative lunar science (TLS) questions to 
address and NASA has selected nine new partners for commercial payload 
delivery services to the Moon through Commercial Lunar Payloads 
Services (CLPS) contracts: 

https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/news/774/nasa-announces-new-partnerships
-for-commercial-lunar-payload-delivery-services

In Microsymposium 60, Forward to the Moon to Stay: Undertaking 
Transformative Lunar Science with Commercial Partners, key scientists 
will discuss scientific questions and identifying the most important 
immediate steps to address them.

Representatives of the designated Commercial Lunar Payloads Services 
(CLPS) providers have been invited to give summaries of 
plans/capabilities of delivery platforms. SpaceX, a non-CLPS lunar 
service provider, will also be giving a presentation.

We will have "lighting talks" to present ideas for experiments, 
payloads and missions to team with CLPS partners (send candidate 
title/authors to james_head@brown.edu).

The goal of Microsymposium 60 is to provide a framework of mutual 
communication that will form a basis for Transformative Lunar Science 
to be undertaken in the immediate future with the help of our CLPS 
partners.
