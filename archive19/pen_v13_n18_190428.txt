LSST SOLAR SYSTEM READINESS SPRINT

The Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) will catalog millions of 
Solar System objects. The LSST Solar System Science Collaboration 
(SSSC) is hosting a sprint June 4-6, 2019 at Adler Planetarium to 
continue the work that the planetary community needs to do to prepare 
for the deluge of LSST data. This includes laying the infrastructure 
groundwork for joint computational tools drafting user-contributed 
data products, discussing funding proposals and new collaborations, 
brainstorming possible citizen science and machine learning 
applications to LSST Solar System data, and others issues to be 
identified by June 2019.

We have a few spots we are opening to non-SSSC members. Due to its 
interactive nature, we are limiting the sprint to approximately 20-25 
attendees. Please register by 9 pm PDT on May 9, 2019, to be 
considered for attending the sprint: 

https://forms.gle/UtfrhdAY9vBRaH487 

There is no registration fee. Selection of attendees 
will be focused on ensuring a wide variety of career stages, skill 
sets, perspectives, research expertise, backgrounds, and experiences 
are represented at the sprint.

PHD STUDENTS IN SPACE PHYSICS TO STUDIES OF SPACE PLASMAS

Applications are invited for Ph.D. students to study kinetic plasma 
processes operating in space plasma regions of fundamental importance, 
such as magnetic reconnection sites, shocks, and turbulence regions. 
Such processes operate in most astrophysical plasma environments 
leading to plasma heating and production of energetic particles. The 
students will work with experimental data from the NASA Magnetospheric 
MultiScale mission.

The positions are available at IRF's Uppsala office, located at the 
Angstrom Laboratory, starting by the second half of 2019 for a total of 
four years. The Ph.D. students will belong to the Department of Physics 
and Astronomy, Uppsala University, and must fulfill the university 
requirements. More information:

EPSC-DPS SESSION TP15: VOLCANISM AND TECTONISM ACROSS THE SOLAR SYSTEM

EPSC-DPS Joint Meeting 2019
Geneva, Switzerland
September 15-20, 2019

Abstract submission is now open for the session "Volcanism and 
Tectonism Across the Solar System".
Deadline: May 8, 2019, 13:00 CEST

Volcanism and tectonism are two of the most ubiquitous processes at 
work in the Solar System, shaping substantially the surfaces of worlds 
as diverse as the terrestrial and dwarf planets, main-belt asteroids, 
and icy satellites. Through a combination of solicited and contributed 
presentations, this session will host observational, analytical, 
theoretical, and analogue fieldwork research into any aspect of 
planetary volcanic and tectonic activity. We welcome submissions that 
compare landforms and processes on multiple bodies, geochemical and 
chronological data from planetary material, and how lessons from 
specific studies can be applied to understanding volcanism and 
tectonism across the Solar System.

Looking forward to meeting you in Geneva!

EPSC-DPS SESSION TP17/OPS8: ATMOSPHERES AND EXOSPHERES OF TERRESTRIAL 
BODIES

We would like to invite you to submit abstracts to our EPSC-DPS session 
TP17/OPS8, "Atmospheres and Exospheres of Terrestrial Bodies"

https://meetingorganizer.copernicus.org/EPSC-DPS2019/session/34065

Space missions have provided a wealth of data on the atmospheres and 
aeronomy of rocky planets and moons, from the lower layers up to the 
external envelopes in direct contact with the solar wind. An recent 
emerging finding is evidence that the atmosphere behaves as a single 
coherent system with complex coupling between layers.

This session solicits contributions that investigate processes at work 
(chemistry, energetics, dynamics, electricity, escape, etc.) on Venus, 
Mars, and Titan and includes studies of the coupling between the 
lower/middle and upper atmospheres. Contributions based on analysis of 
recent spacecraft and ground-based observations, comparative 
planetology studies, numerical modeling and relevant laboratory 
investigations are particularly welcome. The session will consist of 
invited and contributed oral talks as well as posters.

The abstract deadline is May 8, 2019, at 13:00 CET. Hope to see you in 
Geneva!

The conveners: Anni Maattanen, Michael Chaffin, Francisco 
Gonzalez-Galindo, Majd Mayyasi, Claire Newman, Takehiko Satoh, Dmitrij

primarily building on data from the Dawn and other spacecraft missions, 
along with complementary observations from ground and space telescopic 
assets. Studies on the composition, geological properties, surface and 
internal processes of Vesta, Ceres, and other main belt asteroids in 
general are encouraged. We also foster studies on the formation of 
planetesimals, their differentiation, and further evolution, including 
their collisional break-up and creation of families of new generation 
asteroids. Contributions shedding new light on the processes driving 
asteroid accretion, evolution, and the information they bring to early 
Solar System history, are also welcomed. This session aims to provide 
an update on the state of knowledge of the Main Belt.

[NASA] COMMUNITY ANNOUNCEMENT: ROSES FUNDING FOR CITIZEN SCIENCE

Citizen Science is a form of open collaboration in which individuals or 
organizations participate voluntarily in the scientific process in 
various ways.

This year we are highlighting the new Science Mission Directorate (SMD) 
policy inviting investigators to incorporate citizen science into their 
research. ROSES proposers will be asked to answer a question in NSPIRES 
to indicate if their proposals incorporate citizen science components.

Proposals submitted to any ROSES-2019 call, unless otherwise noted in 
the program element, may be entirely or partially citizen 
science-based. Citizen science projects shall be held to the same 
rigorous standards as any SMD science program.  

Proposers are encouraged to read Science Policy Document SPD-33, which 
provides additional information about standards for evaluating citizen 
science projects. 

SPD-33 is available here:

https://smd-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/science-red/s3fs-public/atoms/files/
SPD%2033%20Citizen%20Science.pdf

Additional funding may be available for proposals incorporating citizen 
science.

For more information on ongoing SMD citizen science projects, see 

https://science.nasa.gov/citizenscientists 

or email Marc.J.Kuchner@nasa.gov.

CITIZEN SCIENCE PARTNERSHIP OFFERED BY COSMOQUEST AT PSI

The CosmoQuest team is available to partner on ROSES and NSF proposals 
with citizen science components. Our platform was the first to achieve 
surface science results from the general public that are comparable to 
those of professionals (Robbins, et al. 2014), and today we are working 
with the OSIRIS-REx team to provide internal mapping solutions that 
will grow into public citizen science projects in later mission stages. 
Our software has a python backbone that allows your custom code to be 
integrated as needed to create a seamless data reduction pipeline where 
people are part of the process.

CosmoQuest works with a tight-knit community of adults who are 
long-term participants that you can come to know (or leave community 
engagement to us). In addition to our citizen science tools, we also 
provide our community online seminars, news shows, and other content 
through new media platforms like Twitch.tv, YouTube, and Discord. Your 
volunteers will both learn and do science! In January 2019, CosmoQuest 
became part of the Planetary Science Institute. Our admin team is ready 
to help professionally and accurately process grants. Contact project 
director Pamela Gay, plg@psi.edu, to learn more.

SMALL BODIES SESSION, THE 4TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON LUNAR AND 
DEEP SPACE EXPLORATION

July 22-24, Zhuhai, China

Abstract deadline: June 7, 2019

http://ldse2019.csp.escience.cn/

The International Conference on Lunar and Deep Space Exploration (LDSE) 
is a bi-annual event jointly organized by China National Space 
Administration (CNSA) and Chinese Academy of Sciences. With the rapid 
development of lunar and deep space exploration in China in the recent 
decades, this conference is becoming a major forum in China to discuss 
ideas and scientific results in planetary explorations. The topics 
cover all areas in planetary researches and road maps, with the focus 
on exploration missions and related ground observations, laboratory 
experiments, and theoretical work.

The Small Bodies Session of LDSE promotes researches of Solar System 
small bodies from the past and current missions and helps develop 
future mission concepts. Solar System small bodies are considered the 
best-preserved fossils from the early era of the planetary system 
formation. The CNSA has selected the next Chinese small body mission 
to return samples from Earth's quasi-satellite 2016 HO3 and then orbit 
the main belt comet (MBC) 133P/Elst-Pizarro. In this context, we 
welcome abstracts on all aspects of small bodies research, especially 
near-Earth objects and MBCs.
