[NASA] INTERDISCIPLINARY CONSORTIA FOR ASTROBIOLOGY RESEARCH (ICAR)

The Planetary Science Division intends to solicit Interdisciplinary
Consortia for Astrobiology Research (ICAR) to support the goal of the
NASA's Astrobiology program in the study of the origins, evolution, and
distribution of life in the universe. It is anticipated that research
areas in this cycle will include: prebiotic chemistry and early Earth
environments, early life and increasing complexity, and the
habitability and biosignatures on exoplanets. PIs selected as a result
of proposals to this program element will become members of the newly
established Astrobiology Program Research Coordination Networks that
are relevant to their selected research.
 
The Planetary Science Division intends to solicit ICAR proposals every
other year, either as a program element in ROSES-2019 or as a separate
Cooperative Agreement Notice. Either way, it is expected that the final
text will be released in NSPIRES no fewer than 90 days prior to the
full or Step-2 proposal due date.

be reached at mary.voytek-1@nasa.gov.

ICARUS NEWS: TWITTER FEED, LETTERS, INVITED REVIEWS, SPECIAL ISSUES
 
Icarus now has a Twitter feed: 
@IcarusJournal

https://twitter.com/IcarusJournal

The feed is set up show papers published (updated daily) but, as we
build a following, we will be able to add a curator and some more
content.

We are now pleased to announce the introduction of a Letter article
type for Icarus, allowing the rapid publication of concise articles
that deal with all aspects of Solar System studies. The aim is to offer
an effective method of bringing new results quickly to the public.
Manuscript size is limited to 3000 words, with a maximum of 4 figures
and/or tables, and no more than 4 pages of supplementary materials.
Authors should select the article type "Letter" when submitting their
contribution. The Letters are short research papers and do not replace
Icarus Notes (for which Supplementary materials are not allowed).

We are also pleased to announce the introduction of Invited Reviews for
Icarus. From time to time the Editors may invite specific authors or
groups to contribute a review article to Icarus on a key topic, area,
or event. Invited Review authors should select the article type
"Invited Review" when submitting their contribution. Only reviews that
have been specifically invited by the Editors will be considered.

Special issues: We welcome proposals for special issues. Our Tunguska
special issue is being published this month. Special issues on Mars
Express to ExoMars and Late Mars Workshop are in progress, as are
special issues on Cassini and TNOs.

JWST MASTER CLASS CALL FOR APPLICATIONS NOW OPEN
  
Space Telescope Science Institute (STScI) will host approximately 25
participants for a 4.5-day, in-depth Master Class in Baltimore, MD on
November 18-22, 2019. The Master Class will include topics related to
James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) proposal planning, including user
tools, instrument modes, example science cases, documentation, and help
resources, as well as guidance with teaching these topics to others.
Graduates of the Master Class are expected to give back to the JWST
user community in two ways: by hosting proposal-preparation training
activities at their home institution(s) and by serving as a local
expert for colleagues in the months before the JWST Cycle 1 General
Observer (GO1) proposal deadline in Spring 2020.

This call is open to all potential JWST observers, regardless of career
stage or research interests. Advanced graduate students/postdocs and
those from geographically-remote areas are especially encouraged to
apply. Although not required, we encourage partnered or team
applications from geographically-concentrated institutions.

Submit an online application by 5 p.m. (ET) on June 3, 2019.

GUEST SCIENTIST OR POSTDOCTORAL POSITION IN SPACE PHYSICS

The Solar System Physics and Space Technology research programme at the
Swedish Institute of Space Physics in Kiruna, IRF, invites applications
for a postdoctoral position in Space Physics, related to the ESA
Rosetta mission to comet 67P Churyumov-Gerasimenko.

The mission is now in an intensive data analysis phase. Applications
are invited both for a guest scientist or postdoc position up to the
end of 2020, with some possibility to two years in total.

The position is a research position for studies of the cometary plasma
environment and its interaction with the solar wind primarily using ion
data from the Ion Composition Analyzer on board Rosetta.

The position is funded by the Swedish Research Council.

Contact: Dr. Hans Nilsson, hans.nilsson@irf.se, +46-980-79 127

Applications: registrator@irf.se

Closing date: 16 June 2019

Reference number: 2.2.1-154/19 

https://www.irf.se/jobb

IRF is a governmental research institute that conducts postgraduate
education and research in space physics, atmospheric physics and space
technology. Many projects are run as international projects in
collaboration with other research institutes and space agencies. IRF
has 100 employees and offices in Kiruna (headquarters), Umea, Uppsala
and Lund.

AN UPDATE ON NASA PARTICIPATION ON ENVISION VENUS MISSION STUDY

As has been announced previously (most recently at the LPSC Venus
Townhall in March), NASA has been invited by ESA to participate in the
EnVision mission study, part of the M5 competition. The EnVision
mission concept would conduct high resolution radar mapping and
atmospheric studies, with a launch readiness date of 2032.

NASA has responded to ESA's invitation by providing two US Venus
scientists to the EnVision Science Study Team and a systems engineer to
the System Engineering Working Group. This partnership has been quite
successful.

In March 2019, as part of the mission study process, NASA invited
responses of interest and technical capabilities related to a potential
instrument and other flight subsystem contributions from three
organizations: GSFC, JPL and APL. In late April, NASA received the
responses from these institutions and is in the process of assessing
them for technical and cost feasibility. The assessment process will
take about two months, after which time NASA will determine how to
proceed. As presented at the LPSC Venus Town Hall, should ESA choose
EnVision as the M5 mission, the science team for any potential
contributed facility instrument will be openly competed.

At this time, NASA has not committed to providing a contribution to the
mission. For questions or comments, please contact Dr. Adriana Ocampo
at aco@nasa.gov
