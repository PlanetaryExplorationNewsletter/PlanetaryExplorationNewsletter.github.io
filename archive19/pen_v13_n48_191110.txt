WOMEN IN SPACE CONFERENCE

Women in Space 2020 is an opportunity for scientists and engineers to 
showcase their work in the field of space and planetary science. The 
event highlights the achievements of women and non-binary researchers, 
while offering an opportunity to discuss, challenge, network, and 
support their peers. Women in Space Conference is held on May 6-8, 
2020, at the Canadian Space Agency Headquarters, Saint-Hubert, Quebec.

Abstract submission deadline: December 20, 2019

EGU 2020 SESSION GM11.1/PS4: PLANETARY GEOMORPHOLOGY

Please consider submitting an abstract to the session on Planetary 
Geomorphology at EGU 2020 (Vienna, 3-8 May 2020).

The Planetary Geomorphology session aims to bring together 
geomorphologists who study the Earth with those who work on other 
bodies such as Mars, Venus, Mercury, the Moon, icy satellites of the 
outer Solar System, comets, and/or asteroids. Studies applicable to 
landscapes on any scale on any solid body are welcome. We particularly 
encourage those who use Earth analogues or laboratory/numerical 
simulation to submit their work. Considered processes could include 
aeolian, volcanic, tectonic, fluvial, glacial, periglacial, or 
"undetermined" ones. We especially welcome contributions from 
early-career scientists and geomorphologists who are new to planetary 
science.

The session will include an invited presentation from Michelle Koutnik 
on the topic of ice preservation and landscape erosion during glacial 
retreat on Earth and Mars.

The abstract deadline is January 15, 2020 (13:00 CET), but those 
seeking financial support must submit their abstract by December 1.

EGU 2020 SESSION PS5.3: OUTER PLANET MOON-MAGNETOSPHERE INTERACTION

Abstract deadline: 15 Jan 2020
EGU 2020, May 3-8, 2020 
Vienna, Austria

https://meetingorganizer.copernicus.org/EGU2020/session/36512

The focus of this session is the interaction between the outer planet 
moons in our Solar System and their magnetospheric environment. Prior 
developments in this field have lead to significant discoveries (e.g.,
subsurface oceans) and have given rise to new open questions (e.g., 
active plumes on Europa). Considering the unprecedented opportunities 
the upcoming ESA's JUICE and NASA's Europa Clipper missions, it is 
essential to bring together the space community on this topic. This 
session is important to maximize the scientific output of past and 
current missions, in support of the future missions.

The different topics include the fundamental electromagnetic 
interactions of satellites enclosed in diverse atmospheric envelopes, 
the effect of active processes on the local electromagnetic fields, the 
existence of sub-surface oceans, space weathering of moon surfaces, 
preparatory studies for future missions, supporting laboratory studies, 
simulation studies and observations.

Abstracts on all outer planet moons are welcome, including those in the 
magnetospheres of Jupiter and Saturn and those in the not-well explored 
magnetospheres of Neptune and Uranus.

This document contains the current agenda for VM7, which will be held 
Wednesday, November 13, 3-5pm EST, as well as WebEx connection 
information. This meeting is open to all members of the Mars science 
community, including international colleagues.

Additionally, MEPAG has created a Google spreadsheet to facilitate 
collaboration and communication regarding community-generated white 
papers, as inputs to the next Planetary Science Decadal Survey: 

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/2/d

=gmail_link

All members of the Mars community are welcomed to view or add 
information to this spreadsheet: to find additional authors for a white 
paper topic, to volunteer to assist with a white paper topic, or to 
share a relevant resource with the community. Additionally, the first 
tab includes links to other spreadsheets of this sort within the 
planetary community. We hope this will be a helpful resource for the 
Mars and general planetary community. If you have questions or comments 
about this spreadsheet, please contact mepagmeetingqs@jpl.nasa.gov. 
This spreadsheet, and other MEPAG preparation for the Decadal Survey, 
will be discussed at VM7.

GBO, NRAO, AND LBO SEEK PLANETARY SCIENTISTS FOR PROPOSAL REVIEW PANELS

The science staff at Green Bank Observatory (GBO) would like to recruit 
planetary scientists to serve as proposal reviewers for GBO telescopes, 
as well as telescopes operated by the National Radio Astronomy 
Observatory (NRAO), and the Long Baseline Observatory (LBO).

Proposals to GBO, NRAO, and LBO for the scientific use of radio 
telescopes are evaluated on the basis of scientific merit and technical 
feasibility using a panel-review system. The system aims to ensure that 
scientifically knowledgeable peers, representing the broad diversity of 
the community at large, provide expert proposal evaluations.

In response to community concern that planetary science has been 
under-represented on previous panels, NRAO, GBO, and LBO are 
particularly welcoming volunteer panelists who are engaged in Solar 
System science.

More information on the NRAO/GBO/LBO proposal review process can be 
found here:

EXOPLANETS IN OUR BACKYARD: SOLAR SYSTEM AND EXOPLANET SYNERGIES ON 
PLANETARY FORMATION, EVOLUTION, AND HABITABILITY

The Exoplanets in Our Backyard Workshop will be held February 5-7, 
2020, at the Lunar and Planetary Institute, in Houston, Texas, 
immediately following the Outer Planets Assessment Group (OPAG) 
meeting.

The workshop is co-organized with the Venus Exploration Analysis Group 
(VEXAG), the Outer Planets Assessment Group (OPAG), and the 
Exoplanet Exploration Program Analysis Group (ExoPAG), to increase 
much-needed collaboration between the exoplanet and Solar System 
science communities. The goals of the workshop are to examine and 
discuss exoplanet-solar system synergies on planetary properties, 
formation, evolution, and habitability. We invite abstracts for 
contributed oral and poster presentations that focus on: comparative 
planetology; Solar System studies as a baseline to inform studies of 
extrasolar planetary properties and evolution; and lessons learned on 
planetary statistics, demographics, and system architectures from 
extrasolar planetary systems. The workshop aims to foster and build 
new collaborations among scientists in the Solar System and exoplanet 
communities and to help guide the direction of future exploration and 
observations of worlds in the Solar System and beyond. 

The abstract deadline has been extended to November 27, 2019. For more

PLANETARY DATA SYSTEM (PDS) CUSTOMER SATISFACTION SURVEY

NASA is conducting a customer satisfaction survey of the Planetary Data 
System (PDS). This survey will be used to set priorities for the PDS, 
identify areas for improvement, determine what new services are needed, 
and ensure that the needs of the scientific community are well met both 
now and in the future.

This survey will be released via a web link in early December and will 
be open for three weeks. The anonymous survey is open to everyone, and 
will ask questions aimed at both data providers and data consumers, as 
well as questions regarding specific PDS nodes.

In preparation for the survey, the PDS is collecting email addresses of 
parties interested in taking the survey via the following webpage:

https://pds-training.psi.edu/survey

If you sign up via this list, our survey consultant, CFI Group, will 
notify you on behalf of NASA and the PDS when the survey is open; no
personal data is tracked and the survey will remain anonymous. The 
survey will also be advertised through community newsletters once open.
We hope to get the widest response possible and appreciate your support 
in helping us to improve the PDS.
