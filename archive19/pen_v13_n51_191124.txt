2020 PIERAZZO INTERNATIONAL STUDENT TRAVEL AWARD

Application deadline: 9 PM PST, December 6, 2019

Awards will be announced on or before December 13, 2019.

This award is established by the Planetary Science Institute in memory
of Senior Scientist Betty Pierazzo to support and encourage graduate
students to build international collaborations and relationships in
planetary science. Two awards will be made each year, contingent upon
there being meritorious applications. One will be awarded to a graduate
student working on his or her Ph.D. at an institution within the U.S.
This is to support travel to a planetary science related meeting
(conferences and workshops) outside of the U.S. The second award will
be to a graduate student working on his or her Ph.D. at an institution
outside of the U.S. This is to support travel to a planetary science
related meeting within the U.S. These include general meetings that
have planetary-focused sessions such as the AGU, GSA, EGU and IAG.

The award will consist of a certificate and up to $2000US.

TITAN THROUGH TIME WORKSHOP V

The Titan Through Time Workshop V will be held at the University of
Colorado Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics (LASP) in
Boulder, Colorado April 14-16, 2020.

The Titan Through Time Workshop, convened every two to three years, has
been an important venue for the Titan research community to exchange
research results and ideas about the science of the Titan System.
Although the Cassini mission has ended, there is still work to be done
on the returned data, and the recently selected Dragonfly mission
provides longer term opportunities for additional gains in our
understanding. Aside from large space missions, Titan research
continues to progress rapidly through ground-based astronomy, modeling 
and laboratory investigations.

Please save the date and stay tuned for additional information on
registration and abstract submission.

EGU 2020 SESSION BG5.1 BIOLOGY AND GEOLOGY OF EXTREME ENVIRONMENTS ON
EARTH AND PLANETARY ANALOGS

This session welcomes contributions from geophysical, geochemical,
microbial, geological, numerical, and laboratory studies to promote a
better understanding of life in extreme environments. In particular we
call for studies related to 1) possible environments for life emergence
on the Hadean Earth, 2) past and present extreme terrestrial
environments, 3) planetary analogs, and 4) new approaches to detecting/ 
characterizing life in extreme environments.
