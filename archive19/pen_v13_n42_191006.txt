MARS ATMOSPHERE CONFERENCE

The 7th "Mars atmosphere modelling and observations" conference will
take place on June 8-11, 2020, in Paris, France (in Sorbonne
University Auditorium, Place Jussieu)

http://www-mars.lmd.jussieu.fr/paris2020/

Following the successful previous editions, the 7th Mars Atmosphere
Modelling and Observations conference will bring together experts in
observations and modelling of the present and past Mars climate
systems. We will discuss the nature of the atmospheric circulation and
the photochemistry (up to the thermosphere), the dust cycle, the water
cycle (vapor, clouds and frost) and the carbon dioxide cycle (polar
caps).

GRADUATE-STUDENT OPPORTUNITIES IN PLANETARY SURFACE PROCESSES AT
STANFORD

Prospective graduate students interested in planetary surface processes
are invited to apply to join the Earth & Planetary Surface Processes
group in the Department of Geological Sciences at Stanford, for a start
date in the fall of 2020. We focus on utilizing the diverse planetary
bodies of the Solar System as full scale experiments to develop and
test our quantitative understanding of surface processes, and
deciphering the hydrologic and climate histories of planets (including
Earth) through the lens of surface processes.

https://epsp.stanford.edu/

Prospective graduate students should demonstrate strong quantitative
skills and motivation to apply concepts of geomorphology and
sedimentology to the study of planetary surfaces and rocks. The next
application deadline to the department's graduate program is January 7,
2020. Please contact Prof. Lapotre at mlapotre@stanford.edu with any
questions.

TACKLING THE COMPLEXITIES OF SUBSTELLAR OBJECTS: FROM BROWN DWARFS TO
(EXO)PLANETS
    
We welcome participants for our cross-disciplinary highly interactive
workshop "Tackling the Complexities of Substellar Objects: From Brown
Dwarfs to (exo)Planets" in Leiden, the Netherlands, at the Lorentz
Center from Monday Feb 10 to Friday Feb 14, 2020.

Objectives:
  a) Get to know the four scientific communities: Solar System planets
     (including plans for Uranus/Neptune mission), directly imaged
     exoplanets, transiting exoplanets, brown dwarfs,
  b) Exchange knowledge and methods,
  c) Start joint projects (observation proposals, ideas for white
     papers, specific meetings etc.).

You decide!

Lorentz Workshops@Oort are scientific meetings for small groups of up
to 55 participants, including both senior and junior scientists.
Lorentz Center meetings dedicate a considerable amount of time to
discussion sessions, thus stimulating an interactive atmosphere and
encouraging collaborations between participants. This format typically
generates extensive debates and enables significant progress to be made
within the research topic of the meeting.

Check out the participant list, including: Jackie Faherty, Sarah
Casewell, Leigh Fletcher, Laura Kreidberg, Caroline Morley, Matt
Kenworthy, just to name a few:

THE ATLAS OF MARS: MAPPING ITS GEOGRAPHY AND GEOLOGY

Cambridge University Press is pleased to announce the publication of
"The Atlas of Mars". Planetary scientist and educator Ken Coles has
teamed up with Ken Tanaka (formerly of USGS's Astrogeology team), and
Phil Christensen (PI of Mars Odyssey's THEMIS science team) to produce
this all-purpose, large-format reference atlas. Each of the thirty
standard charts includes: a full-page color topographic map at
1:10,000,000 scale, a THEMIS daytime infrared map at the same scale
with features labeled, a simplified geologic map of the corresponding
area, and a section describing prominent features of interest. The
Atlas is rounded out with extensive material on Mars' global
characteristics, regional geography and geology, a glossary of terms,
and an indexed gazetteer of up-to-date Martian feature names and
nomenclature. This is an essential guide for a broad readership of
researchers, students, and space enthusiasts, replacing the NASA atlas
from the 1970s.

FUNDAMENTAL PLANETARY SCIENCE: PHYSICS, CHEMISTRY AND HABITABILITY

A quantitative introduction to the Solar System and planetary systems
science for advanced undergraduate students, this engaging textbook by
two well known planetary scientists explains the wide variety of
physical, chemical and geological processes that govern the motions and
properties of planets. The authors provide an overview of our current
knowledge and discuss some of the unanswered questions at the forefront
of research in planetary science and astrobiology today. This updated
edition contains the latest data, new references and planetary images
and an extensively rewritten chapter on current research on exoplanets.
The text concludes with an introduction to the fundamental properties
of living organisms and the relationship that life has to its host
planet. With more than 200 exercises to help students learn how to
apply the concepts covered, this textbook is ideal for a one-semester
or two-quarter undergraduate course.
