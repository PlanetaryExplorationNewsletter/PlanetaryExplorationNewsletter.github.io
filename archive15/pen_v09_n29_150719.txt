2ND ANNOUNCEMENT FOR THE FIRST LANDING SITE/EXPLORATION ZONE WORKSHOP 
FOR HUMAN MISSIONS TO THE SURFACE OF MARS
  
This announcement provides the details on how to participate in the 
workshop.

The workshop will be held October 27 to 30, 2015, at the Lunar 
Planetary Institute (LPI) in Houston, TX. The purpose of this workshop 
is to identify and discuss candidate locations where humans could land, 
live and work on the martian surface.

NASA hopes to engage scientists, technologists and experts in human 
exploration during the conference, fostering collaboration among the 
teams that will enable humans to explore Mars in the coming decades.

Potential "Exploration Zones" will need to offer compelling science 
research while also providing resources that our astronauts can take 
advantage of during their pioneering of the Red Planet. First 
explorers will be limited to about 60 miles (100 km) of travel from 
their landing site due to life support and exploration technology 
requirements.

NASA POSTDOCTORAL FELLOWSHIPS

The NASA Postdoctoral Program (NPP) provides opportunities for 
scientists and engineers to conduct research largely of their own 
choosing, yet compatible with the research opportunities posted on 
the NPP Web site.

Selected by a competitive peer-review process, NPP Fellows complete 
one- to three-year Fellowship appointments that advance NASA's 
missions in Earth science, heliophysics, astrophysics, planetary 
science, astrobiology, space bioscience, aeronautics and engineering, 
human exploration and operations, and space technology.

A sample research opportunity is:

https://www3.orau.gov/NPDoc/Catalog/17736

Applicants must have a Ph.D. or equivalent degree in hand before 
beginning the fellowship, but may apply while completing the degree 
requirements. U. S. citizens, Lawful Permanent Residents, and foreign 
nationals eligible for J-1 status as a Research Scholar may apply.

Stipends start at $53,500 per year, with supplements for high 
cost-of-living areas and for certain academic specialties. Financial 
assistance is available for relocation and health insurance, and 
$8,000 per year is provided for professional travel.

Applications are accepted three times each year: March 1, July 1, 
and November 1.

* Design of notional observing program(s);
* Development of science data analysis techniques; and
* Development of simulations and data challenges to validate the 
  above items.

* Coordinating performance requirements and observing program 
  activities;
* Acting as a liaison between scientists and the instrument team;
* Balancing the use of the relevant instrument to achieve all 
  WFIRST science; and
* Communication with the astronomical community.

GSA 2015 SESSION T132. MINERALOGY OF DIAGENESIS ON EARTH AND MARS: 
IN HONOR OF NICOLAS J. TOSCA, 2015 MSA AWARDEE

This session will be held at the GSA Annual Meeting, taking place in 
Baltimore, MD on November 1-4, 2015. It is in honor of Nick Tosca,
winner of the 2015 MSA Award, and will be devoted to recent 
experimental, theoretical, and observational advances in 
characterizing and interpreting the mineralogical relationships 
developed during aqueous diagenesis on both Earth and Mars.

AGU 2015 SESSION 8104. EVOLUTIONS, INTERACTIONS AND ORIGINS OF OUTER 
PLANET SATELLITES

This session explores current and past planetary processes that lead 
to unique present day conditions on outer planet satellites. The 
session will consist of invited and contributed talks that highlight 
geological and geophysical modeling and interpretation of both 
remote-sensed and in-situ data. Presentations on interaction of 
planetary field and plasma  with the surfaces and interiors of the 
moons and theoretical models of the origin and evolution of surfaces 
and interiors of the moons are also welcome. Contributions that 
investigate processes on multiple moons to uncover underlying 
trends are especially welcome.

AGU 2015 SESSION 8234. MERCURY AFTER MESSENGER

We are pleased to announce a session on Mercury at the 2015 AGU Fall 
Meeting in San Francisco, CA, December 14-18, 2015.

NASA's MESSENGER spacecraft completed more than four years of orbital 
operations at Mercury in April 2015. The mission returned 
unprecedented measurements of Mercury's surface, interior, exosphere, 
and magnetosphere that collectively have revolutionized our 
understanding of the innermost planet. This session will highlight 
results from the most recent, highest-resolution observations returned 
by MESSENGER, as well as results from analysis of the six years of 
flyby and orbital data from this highly successful mission, to 
understand Mercury's geological evolution, the planet's geophysical 
and geochemical characteristics, and the interaction of the planet's 
exosphere and magnetosphere with the solar wind and interplanetary 
magnetic field. We also welcome contributed papers on complementary 
ground-based observations, laboratory measurements, theoretical 
developments relevant to planetary processes at Mercury, and future 
mission opportunities.

Please consider submitting an abstract for this session. For more 
information,visit:

The submission deadline is August 5, 2015.

Conveners:
Paul Byrne (Lunar and Planetary Institute)
Larry Nittler (Carnegie Institution of Washington)
Sean Solomon (Columbia University)

We look forward to seeing you in San Francisco.

AGU 2015 SESSION 8371. ERA OF CITIZEN SCIENCE AND BIG DATA: 
INTERSECTION OF OUTREACH, CROWD-SOURCED DATA AND SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH

Abstracts due 5 August 2015.

The traditional method of outreach to formal, informal, science and 
non-science audiences has undergone a fundamental change with recent 
advances in technology, social media and crowd-sourced data, giving 
way to citizen science with many applications. With increasing 
"Big Data" projects, active partnerships between professional, amateur 
and data scientist communities are necessary. Innovative design, 
sustainability and evaluation of these projects is as important as the 
citizen science they generate. This session invites papers from 
scientists, educators and as well as those who design, facilitate, 
evaluate or fund such programs. Topics may include methodology, 
applications of citizen science to enhancing outreach, transformative 
approaches to science education, lessons learned, and the future of 
citizen science. Presentations are invited from all scientific 
disciplines: astronomy, planetary and space science, geology and 
geophysics, seismology, biogeoscience, atmosphere and ocean sciences.

AGU 2015 SESSION 8664. POLARIMETRY AS A TOOL TO STUDY THE EARTH, 
SOLAR SYSTEM AND BEYOND

Abstracts due 5 August 2015.

Polarimetry is a powerful tool providing a wealth of information about 
various solar system objects (e.g., planetary atmospheres; 
atmosphereless objects, comets, dust, asteroids, ring systems) and 
terrestrial phenomena, including habitability. Polarimetric techniques, 
combined with imaging and spectroscopic methods, are used to explore 
the microphysics of terrestrial clouds; magnetic fields; biological 
activity of molecules and properties of regoliths on planetary 
satellites. The session is open to invited and contributed oral and 
poster papers about recent observational results; advances in vector 
radiative transfer theory (including non-sphericity effects on single 
scattering); laboratory measurements; instrumental developments for 
imaging and spectropolarimeters to be included in ground-based 
facilities and space missions in planetary and earth sciences.
