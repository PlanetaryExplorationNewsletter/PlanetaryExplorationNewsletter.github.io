ASTRO-1 REQUIREMENTS TEAM (ART)

The BoldlyGo Institute announces a request for Letters of Interest 
(LOI) from members of the astronomical sciences community to serve on 
the Requirements Team for the ASTRO-1 space telescope. The strawman 
concept for the ASTRO-1 space observatory is a 1.8-meter off-axis 
(unobscured) ultraviolet-visible telescope to be located in a Lagrange 
point or heliocentric orbit with instrumentation for wide-field, 
diffraction-limited panchromatic imaging, medium- and high-resolution 
spectroscopy, and high-contrast imaging. ASTRO-1 is intended for the 
post-Hubble Space Telescope era in the 2020s, addressing topics across 
space astronomy and Solar System science.

Letters of Interest are sought from members of the astronomical 
community who wish to serve a one-year term on the ART optimizing the 
ASTRO-1 science case and observatory design and constructing a design 
reference mission. LOI format and content are described in the Call at 
the ART website at: 

http://astro-1.org/art

Letters should be submitted no later than 8:59pm EDT on October 2, 
2015.

This process is open to all members of the astronomical community, 
including domestic and international institutions, regardless of 
career stage. The ART website includes a link to the ART Charter. 
Questions about ASTRO-1 or the application process can be sent to 
ART@boldlygo.org.

[NASA] UNDERGRADUATE STUDENT INSTRUMENT PROJECT NOI DUE DATE DELAYED

Mandatory Notices of Intent are now due October 15, 2015. The proposal 
due date remains unchanged at November 20, 2015.

This solicitation calls for proposals from U.S. institutions of higher 
education to develop an undergraduate-led Project Team that will fly a 
science and/or technology payload relevant to NASA strategic goals and 
objectives on a sounding rocket, balloon, aircraft, suborbital reusable 
launch vehicle (sRLV), or CubeSat launched on an orbital launch vehicle.

NASA POSTDOCTORAL FELLOWSHIPS

The NASA Postdoctoral Program (NPP) provides opportunities for 
scientists and engineers to conduct research largely of their own 
choosing, yet compatible with the research opportunities posted on the 
NPP Web site.

Selected by a competitive peer-review process, NPP Fellows complete 
one- to three-year Fellowship appointments that advance NASA's missions 
in Earth science, heliophysics, astrophysics, planetary science, 
astrobiology, space bioscience, aeronautics and engineering, human 
exploration and operations, and space technology.

An example of one of the research opportunities in planetary science 
is: 

https://apps.orau.gov/NPDoc/Catalog/18212

Applicants must have a Ph.D. or equivalent degree in hand before
beginning the fellowship, but may apply while completing the degree 
requirements. U. S. citizens, Lawful Permanent Residents, and foreign 
nationals eligible for J-1 status as a Research Scholar may apply.

Stipends start at $53,500 per year, with supplements for high 
cost-of-living areas and for certain academic specialties. Financial 
assistance is available for relocation and health insurance, and 
$8,000 per year is provided for professional travel.

Applications are accepted three times each year: March 1, July 1, and 
November 1.

REMOTE SENSING COMPARATIVE PLANETOLOGY POSITION AT UNIVERSITY OF 
ARIZONA

The University of Arizona announces coordinated hiring of five 
tenure-track or tenured faculty positions in Earth system remote 
sensing to establish the Earth Dynamics Observatory (EDO) to respond 
to global challenges in Earth and environmental science, planetary 
science, and hazards and resource assessment. EDO faculty will 
contribute to interdisciplinary research and educational programs 
oriented around remote sensing and Earth and planetary change, with the 
goal of developing instruments, deploying missions, and leading new 
research in applications of remote sensing. One position is in remote 
sensing of planetary surfaces, atmospheres, and/or interiors with 
relevance to multiple planets (including exoplanets) or solar system 
objects and to astrobiology, to provide context for understanding the 
Earth. Experience in field and lab work and theory are also desirable. 
The scientist will have expertise in planetary science and observing 
techniques to a) develop instrumentation and techniques and lead 
experiments for planetary science (including Earth), and b) provide 
perspective on the implications for Earth of knowledge about other 
planets and vice versa. Inquiries should be directed to Tim Swindle 
(tswindle@lpl.arizona.edu), Director, Lunar and Planetary Laboratory.

MOVING OBJECT DETECTION AND CHARACTERIZATION AT UNIVERSITY OF ARIZONA

The University of Arizona (UA) invites applications for a faculty 
position in moving object detection and characterization. Candidates 
should have a focus on moving objects and an interest in applying their 
expertise to problems related to the detection and characterization of 
both manmade and natural objects. Desired areas of expertise would 
include but not be limited to signal and image processing, feature 
extraction, spectral analysis, sparse representation, pattern 
recognition, scene analysis, and computer vision. The successful 
candidate's research program will be enabled by data from UA asteroid 
survey programs, the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope, and other assets 
available to UA astronomers. The successful candidate will be part of 
a dedicated, multi-disciplinary team tackling the problem of Space 
Situational Awareness (SSA). 

The challenge of SSA is to provide commercial, civil and military space 
operators with a comprehensive knowledge of what is currently happening 
in space and to predict what may happen in the future. Inquiries should 
be directed to Brian Ten Eyck, bteneyck@email.arizona.edu. Full details
