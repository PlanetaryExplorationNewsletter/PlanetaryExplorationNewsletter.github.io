[NASA] NEW VOLUNTEER OPPORTUNITY: CDAP REVIEWER FORM POSTED

The Planetary Science Division is seeking subject matter experts to 
serve as mail-in and/or panel meeting reviewers of ROSES 2015 
proposals. We have posted a volunteer reviewer form for: ROSES 2015 
C.10 Cassini Data Analysis and Participating Scientists Program. 
Either follow the link embedded above, or start at: 

http://science.nasa.gov/researchers/volunteer-review-panels/ 

choose ROSES 2015 C.10 Cassini Data Analysis and Participating 
Scientists Program and indicate the Mission's instruments and or areas 
of expertise by clicking the boxes. If your skills match our needs for 
this review we will contact you to discuss scheduling.

NASA POSTDOCTORAL FELLOWSHIPS
 
The NASA Postdoctoral Program (NPP) provides opportunities for 
scientists and engineers to conduct research largely of their own 
choosing, yet compatible with the research opportunities posted on the 
NPP Web site.
 
Selected by a competitive peer-review process, NPP Fellows complete 
one- to three-year Fellowship appointments that advance NASA’s 
missions in Earth science, heliophysics, astrophysics, planetary 
science, astrobiology, space bioscience, aeronautics and engineering, 
human exploration and operations, and space technology.
 
An example of one of the research opportunities in planetary science 
is:
 
https://www3.orau.gov/NPDoc/Catalog/17903
 
Applicants must have a Ph.D. or equivalent degree in hand before 
beginning the fellowship, but may apply while completing the degree 
requirements. U. S. citizens, Lawful Permanent Residents, and foreign 
nationals eligible for J-1 status as a Research Scholar may apply.
 
Stipends start at $53,500 per year, with supplements for high cost-
of-living areas and for certain academic specialties. Financial 
assistance is available for relocation and health insurance, and 
$8,000 per year is provided for professional travel. 

Applications are accepted three times each year: March 1, July 1, 
and November 1.

SECOND LANDING SITE WORKSHOP FOR THE 2020 MARS ROVER MISSION 

The Second Landing Site Workshop for the 2020 Mars Rover mission will 
be held at the Doubletree Hotel, Arcadia, CA, on August 4-6, 2015. The 
full text of the Second Announcement, workshop logistics, and a 
request for registration has been posted at: 

http://marsnext.jpl.nasa.gov/
 
The primary goal of the second workshop will be to evaluate the ~30 
candidate landing sites that emerged from the first workshop as well 
as any new sites proposed. We are soliciting presentations on the 
science merits of candidate landing sites for the Mars 2020 mission.

Presenters at the workshop must make a comprehensive, persuasive talk 
on why a site is the right one for the 2020 mission and payload, 
including how the science objectives of the mission can be 
accomplished and (where possible) an assessment of how the surface 
characteristics meet the engineering criteria so that each site can be 
comprehensively and fairly assessed. Presentations are also solicited 
on the surface characteristics of the landing sites and how well they 
conform to the engineering requirements.
 
All members of the scientific community are encouraged to participate 
in the Mars 2020 site selection process.
 
Sincerely,
John Grant and Matt Golombek
Co-Chairs, Mars Landing Site Steering Committee

ASSOCIATE RESEARCH SCIENTIST (LAB MANAGER) - ARIZONA STATE UNIVERSITY

The Center for Meteorite Studies in the School of Earth and Space 
Exploration at Arizona State University invites applications for an 
Associate Research Scientist (Lab Manager) position. The successful 
candidate will be responsible for the day-to-day operation and 
management of the Isotope Cosmochemistry and Geochronology Laboratory, 
which includes a ThermoNeptune MC-ICPMS and an associated clean 
chemistry laboratory for ultra low-blank sample preparation. The 
successful candidate will be expected to conduct independent research 
and to participate in ongoing research in isotope cosmochemistry. 

The Center for Meteorite Studies will provide salary support for 75% 
of this position while the remaining 25% (three months) will be from 
other sources. It is expected that after the first two years, the 
successful candidate will fund the remaining 25% of this appointment 
through external funds he/she secures. Subsequent renewal of this 
annual appointment is contingent upon satisfactory performance, 
availability of resources, and the needs of the university.

Minimum qualifications include a Ph.D. by the time of appointment in 
the physical sciences and experience with mass spectrometry. Experience 
in geochemistry and/or cosmochemistry is highly desirable. To apply, 
please see the information provided at:

FINAL VERSION OF MEPAG DOCUMENT

Mars community members,
 
We are very pleased to announce that the “Mars Science Goals, 
Objectives, Investigations, and Priorities: 2015 Version” final 
document has been approved by MEPAG and is now posted on the MEPAG 
website:

http://mepag.nasa.gov/reports.cfm?expand=science
 
In this revision (an update to the 2012 revision, posted in 2014), we 
have revised all four Goals’ chapters: Life, Climate, Geology, 
Preparation for Human Exploration. Some of these chapters have changed 
extensively in both structure and content - a summary of changes is 
outlined in the Preamble. Additionally, this document explicitly 
identifies the cross-cutting aspects that are not captured within the 
Four-Goal, tiered structure, recording them within the supplemental 
high-level summary spreadsheet (also posted on the MEPAG website) and 
in the re-written final chapter (previously known as Section V). These 
efforts have increased the consistency and comprehensiveness of the 
individual Goal chapters, as well the integrated perspective offered 
by the full document.
 
We thank the Goal Representatives for their service and energy in this 
undertaking, and thank all members of the community who provided 
comments and suggestions.
 
- Lisa Pratt, MEPAG Chair
- Vicky Hamilton, MEPAG Goals Committee Chair

POST-DOC ON MODELLING AND OBSERVATIONS OF CO2 ICE CLOUDS ON MARS AT 
LATMOS (GUYANCOURT, FRANCE)

We are currently accepting applications for a fixed-term post-doc
position on studying CO2 ice clouds on Mars. The contract is for 1 year 
+ one additional year based on performance + a possible extension for 
a third year depending on funding sources. The gross salary is minimum 
2500 EUR/month and depends on experience.

The project involves a collaboration between the laboratories LATMOS, 
LMD and Laboratoire d’études spatiales et d’instrumentation en 
astrophysique (LESIA).

More information on the project can be found at:
 
http://www.latmos.ipsl.fr/index.php/fr/stages-theses/posting/77/Post-
doc%20position%20on%20modelling%20and%20observations%20of%20CO2%20ice
%20clouds%20on%20Mars%20
 
We welcome applications from scientists with a PhD (or PhD by the 
time of the post-doc) in planetology, astronomy, meteorology, 
atmospheric sciences, or related fields. Experience in atmospheric 
(in particular global climate) modelling, limb observation analysis, 
and/or radiative transfer modelling are recommended. Fluency in 
using unix/linux environments and Fortran programming will be 
appreciated.
 
Applications (English or French) consisting of a CV, publication list, 
at least one recommendation letter, and a motivation letter should be 
sent to Dr. Anni Määttänen (at anni.maattanen@latmos.ipsl.fr) by August 
15, 2015. The contract can start on November 1, 2015, but a later date 
is negotiable.
