MEMORIAM: ERNST K. ZINNER, 1937-2015

Ernst K. Zinner, research professor in physics and earth and planetary 
sciences at Washington University in St. Louis, passed away on July 30, 
2015 at the age of 78 years. He had been fighting for almost 20 years 
an unusually aggressive form of Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma called Mantle 
Cell Lymphoma. The full obituary can be found here:

RE-CALIBRATED ELEMENTAL COMPOSITION DATA FROM CURIOSITY/CHEMCAM

ChemCam on Curiosity provides a large and varied geochemical dataset 
available for the planetary community that includes elemental 
compositions from more than 6,000 individual points on over 1,000 
geological targets along the rover's traverse. The ChemCam team has 
recently completed a new calibration model that provides significantly 
more accurate results for the major element abundances. While the 
previous calibration model provided good results for fine-grained 
sedimentary targets near the average Mars composition, the new 
calibration increases the accuracy overall and provides significant 
improvements to mineral end-members, particularly silica-rich 
observations such as those of plagioclase. The re-calibrated ChemCam 
data are now available on the Planetary Data System server at:

OPAG MEETING COMING UP

Our next OPAG meeting is fast approaching: 24-26 August at JHU/APL. The 
final agenda is posted on the OPAG homepage - please note that we have 
made some changes. In particular, our R&A town hall will start at 10 AM 
EDT rather than 9 AM on August 24. The meeting will now begin with our 
Science Nugget workshop.  

We have a new page on the OPAG website to post science nuggets.  
Collections of the Cassini nuggets for 2013 and 2014 are posted there.

Registration is still open - the link is on the OPAG homepage: 

http://www.lpi.usra.edu/opag/

This site includes all logistical information.

Please go to the OPAG website and register to post on our OPAG 
discussion board. I'd like to use this to record ideas throughout the 
meeting. Go to the menu tab titled "OPAG Discussion Board." This will 
be a place for us all to post our thoughts and especially our vision 
for the future. Please use it to say what you think!! Right now the 
over-arching science themes part of our new science goals document is 
under construction - we are considering "Explore Ocean Worlds and Ice 
Giants."

Sincerely,

Candy Hansen
OPAG Chair

NASA POSTDOCTORAL FELLOWSHIPS

The NASA Postdoctoral Program (NPP) provides opportunities for 
scientists and engineers to conduct research largely of their own 
choosing, yet compatible with the research opportunities posted on the 
NPP Web site.

Selected by a competitive peer-review process, NPP Fellows complete 
one- to three-year Fellowship appointments that advance NASA's missions 
in Earth science, heliophysics, astrophysics, planetary science, 
astrobiology, space bioscience, aeronautics and engineering, human 
exploration and operations, and space technology.

An example of one of the research opportunities in planetary science 
is:

https://apps.orau.gov/NPDoc/Catalog/17614

Applicants must have a Ph.D. or equivalent degree in hand before 
beginning the fellowship, but may apply while completing the degree 
requirements. U. S. citizens, Lawful Permanent Residents, and foreign 
nationals eligible for J-1 status as a Research Scholar may apply.

Stipends start at $53,500 per year, with supplements for high 
cost-of-living areas and for certain academic specialties. Financial 
assistance is available for relocation and health insurance, and 
$8,000 per year is provided for professional travel.

Applications are accepted three times each year: March 1, July 1, and 
November 1.

INTERNATIONAL OBSERVE THE MOON NIGHT 2015

International Observe the Moon Night (InOMN) is an annual worldwide 
celebration of lunar science and exploration. One day each year, 
everyone on Earth is invited to unite and observe and learn about the 
Moon and its connection to planetary science, and share personal and 
community connections we all have to the Moon. InOMN 2015 is just 
over a month away: September 19, 2015.

We invite you to be a part of it, by hosting or participating in an 
InOMN event.

Check out the InOMN website for a map of registered events, to register 
a new event, and for InOMN resources, including a guide that walks you 
through planning an InOMN event of any size, advertising materials, 
suggested activities, and InOMN Moon map, evaluation materials, and 
more.

LOWELL OBSERVATORY: TENURE-TRACK OR TENURED ASTRONOMER

Lowell Observatory invites applications for one or more tenure-track
or tenured research positions in astronomy or planetary science. We
invite applicants at any career level who can build on current
strengths or open new areas for Lowell. A Ph.D. in astronomy,
planetary science, or a related field is required, as is an outstanding
record of research and demonstrated ability or potential to obtain
external research funding. Candidates are invited to describe how they
would make use of our observational facilities, but we will give equal
consideration to all research areas. The start date for this position
is flexible but desired by Fall 2016.

Additional position details can be found at:

https://lowell.edu/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Tenure-track-
Astronomer.pdf

To apply: Send applications electronically to:
humanresources@lowell.edu

Applications should include:
(1) a cover letter and CV,
(2) a research plan of 3 pages or less, and
(3) names and mail/email addresses of three individuals who have
agreed to serve as references. Do not ask for reference letters
to be sent in advance.

Applications must be received by November 1, 2015 for full
consideration.

Lowell Observatory is an Equal Employment Opportunity/Affirmative 
Action employer.
