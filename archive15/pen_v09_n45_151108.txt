2016 PIERAZZO INTERNATIONAL STUDENT TRAVEL AWARD - DEADLINE FRIDAY

Application deadline: 9 PM PST, November 13, 2015

Awards will be announced on or before November 30, 2015

This award is established by the Planetary Science Institute in memory 
of Senior Scientist Betty Pierazzo to support and encourage graduate 
students to build international collaborations and relationships in 
planetary science. Two awards will be made each year, contingent upon 
there being meritorious applications. One will be awarded to a graduate 
student working on his or her Ph.D. at an institution within the U.S. 
This is to support travel to a planetary science related meeting 
(conferences and workshops) outside of the U.S. The second award will 
be to a graduate student working on his or her Ph.D. at an institution 
outside of the U.S. This is to support travel to a planetary science 
related meeting within the U.S. These include general meetings that 
have planetary-focused sessions such as the AGU, GSA, EGU and IAG.

The award will consist of a certificate and up to $2000US.

THE 4TH BEPIS MEETING IN BEIJING, CHINA

This is a brief notice to announce that we will be holding the fourth 
Beijing Earth and Planetary Interiors Symposium (BEPIS) in 2016.

The meeting will be held, as before, at the Institute of Geology and 
Geophysics, Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing, China. It will run 
from May 27 (Friday) to May 30 (Monday), with May 27 acting as the 
registration day.

BEPIS is a wide ranging meeting, which brings together observations 
and theoretical advances in paleo-, bio-, geo-, and rock magnetism, 
geodynamo theories and models, as well as planetary and solar system 
magnetism. The primary aim of the meeting is to bring scientists in 
different disciplines (experimental, observational, theoretical and 
numerical) together to further our understanding of the origin, 
structure and variations of Earth's and planetary magnetic fields.  

We are looking forward to inviting friends old and new to participate 
in the Beijing Symposium, and we will announce further details on the 
meeting website:

[NASA] EARTH AND SPACE SCIENCE FELLOWSHIP (NESSF) PROGRAM 2016-2017 
ACADEMIC YEAR

New application deadline: February 1, 2016
Renewal application deadline: March 15, 2016

This call for graduate fellowship proposals. Applications are 
solicitied from accredited U.S. universities on behalf of individuals 
pursuing Masters or Doctoral (Ph.D.) degrees in Earth and space 
sciences, or related disciplines.

The Planetary Research Program invites a wide range of investigations 
into the nature and origin of the celestial bodies in our Solar System 
and whether life exists beyond Earth.

Topics may include, but are not limited to investigations [edited]:
- aimed at understanding the formation and evolution of the Solar 
  System and planetary systems in general, and of the planetary bodies, 
  satellites, and small bodies in these systems;
- of extraterrestrial materials;
- which enhance the scientific return of missions through the analysis 
  of data collected by those missions.

ASSISTANT PROFESSOR (TENURE-TRACK), LOIUSIANA STATE UNIVERSITY

The Department of Geology and Geophysics at Louisiana State University 
seeks an outstanding individual with expertise in the broad area of 
geophysics. The specific geophysical research area is open to all 
subdisciplines of geophysics. However, the individual should be able 
to work on problems that either build on existing strengths in the 
Department or advance science in fields that complement these 
strengths.

This tenure-track position at the Assistant Professor level is 
intended to complement our existing research strengths, including 
Coastal Resilience and Near Surface Processes, Evolution of Sedimentary 
Basins, Earth Materials and Processes, Planetary Science, 
Tectonometamorphism, Climate and Tectonics, and Polar Studies. Research 
in this sub-discipline may also build strength in the LSU campus-wide 
research focus areas of "Coastal Sustainability and Environment" 
(CS&E), "Conventional and Renewable Energy" (C&RE), "Core 
Computing/High Performance Computing" (CC/HPC), and "Materials Science 
and Engineering" (MS&E). Nominations or inquiries should be directed to 
Geophysics Search Committee, at 225-578-3353 or geology@lsu.edu

NASA POSTDOCTORAL FELLOWSHIPS

The NASA Postdoctoral Program (NPP) provides opportunities for 
scientists and engineers to conduct research largely of their own 
choosing, yet compatible with the research opportunities posted on the 
NPP Web site.

Selected by a competitive peer-review process, NPP Fellows complete 
one- to three-year Fellowship appointments that advance NASA's missions 
in Earth science, heliophysics, astrophysics, planetary science, 
astrobiology, space bioscience, aeronautics and engineering, human 
exploration and operations, and space technology.

An example of one of the research opportunities in planetary science 
is:

https://apps.orau.gov/NPDoc/Catalog/17565

Applicants must have a Ph.D. or equivalent degree in hand before 
beginning the fellowship, but may apply while completing the degree 
requirements. U. S. citizens, Lawful Permanent Residents, and foreign 
nationals eligible for J-1 status as a Research Scholar may apply.

Stipends start at $53,500 per year, with supplements for high 
cost-of-living areas and for certain academic specialties. Financial 
assistance is available for relocation and health insurance, and 
$8,000 per year is provided for professional travel.

Applications are accepted three times each year: March 1, July 1, and 
November 1.

[NASA] REQUEST FOR INFORMATION: PREPARATION FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF A 
COMMUNITY-BASED ROADMAP FOR PLANETARY DATA SERVICES

Response Date:  January 5, 2016

NASA is preparing to work with the planetary science community to 
develop a Roadmap for its Planetary Data Services - the data and sample 
management architecture that supports the robotic exploration of the 
Solar System - particularly, the Planetary Data System (PDS). This 
Roadmap will address actions for the years 2017-2026. NASA is seeking 
input from the planetary and data science communities in the form of a 
Request For Information (RFI) designated NNH15ZDA012L that has been 
posted on NSPIRES: 

http://nspires.nasaprs.com/

Select Open Solicitations, then search on NNH15ZDA012L.

NASA especially seeks input on the following topics [edited]:

1. What tools, resources, workflows, tutorials, and interfaces
2. Making the archiving process seamless, less costly and more 
   efficient
3. The role of PDS relative to other archiving alternatives (e.g., 
   journals), in providing the public access to NASA-generated data 
4. Integration of PDS data products and USGS, MPC, other products 
5. The role should the PDS play in encouraging the development of 
   higher-order data products
6. Identifiable improvements to the current search capabilities of the 
   PDS

This session #16 aims to give an up-to-date insight on the study of 
ice and permafrost and resulting landforms on planetary surfaces. A 
special emphasis will be on the use of analogous cold-climate 
environments on Earth.
