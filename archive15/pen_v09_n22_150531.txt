Memoriam: Stanton J. Peale, 1937-2015

Stanton J. Peale passed away on May 14, 2015 in Santa Barbara from
complications of leukemia. He was a kind and brilliant planetary 
scientist with expertise in dynamics and geophysics. After earning 
his PhD at Cornell University in 1965, he took a faculty position at 
the University of California, Los Angeles, and then at the University 
of California, Santa Barbara, where he worked from 1968 until 2015.
His most recent work was submitted for publication on May 11, 2015. 
His contributions include the prediction of widespread volcanism on 
Jupiter's moon Io, the derivation of a general theoretical framework 
that governs the rotational states of bodies subject to tides, the
study of tidal evolution in satellite systems, and the development of 
an ingenious procedure to determine the size and state of Mercury's 
core. He was also a pioneer in the study of extrasolar planets, 
both in terms of their dynamics and their detection by micro-lensing. 
Stan was awarded the Newcomb Cleveland Prize (1979), the James Craig
Watson Medal (1982), and the Brouwer Award (1992). He was elected to 
the National Academy of Sciences in 2009. He was a wonderful, beloved
colleague and will be deeply missed.

TRAINING OPPORTUNITY INTRODUCTION TO GIS FOR PLANETARY MAPPERS

The MRCTR GIS Laboratory at the Astrogeology Science Center of the 
U.S. Geologic Survey would like to invite researchers from the 
planetary mapping community to join us for two and half days of 
hands-on GIS training. While we will focus on the use of Esri's ArcMap 
for geologic mapping, we will touch on a using other GIS applications. 
The goal of the workshop will be to teach the participants how to 
initiate, organize, and implement "best practices" for a digital 
planetary mapping project. For additional information and sign-up 
instructions, please see:

NASA POSTDOCTORAL FELLOWSHIPS
 
The NASA Postdoctoral Program (NPP) provides opportunities for 
scientists and engineers to conduct research largely of their own 
choosing, yet compatible with the research opportunities posted on the 
NPP Web site.
 
Selected by a competitive peer-review process, NPP Fellows complete 
one- to three-year Fellowship appointments that advance NASAâ€™s missions 
in Earth science, heliophysics, astrophysics, planetary science, 
astrobiology, space bioscience, aeronautics and engineering, human 
exploration and operations, and space technology.
 
An example of one of the research opportunities in planetary science 
is:
 
https://www3.orau.gov/NPDoc/Catalog/18818
 
Applicants must have a Ph.D. or equivalent degree in hand before 
beginning the fellowship, but may apply while completing the degree 
requirements. U. S. citizens, Lawful Permanent Residents, and foreign 
nationals eligible for J-1 status as a Research Scholar may apply.
 
Stipends start at $53,500 per year, with supplements for high cost-of-
living areas and for certain academic specialties. Financial 
assistance is available for relocation and health insurance, and 
$8,000 per year is provided for professional travel.

Applications are accepted three times each year: March 1, July 1, 
and November 1.

INTERNATIONAL MEETING: MISSIONS TO HABITABLE WORLDS

28-29 of October 2015
Budapest, Hungary

The two day long meeting will take place at the main building of the 
Hungarian Academy of Sciences on 28-29 of October 2015. During the 
conference review presentations will be given by experts and mission 
specialists of ongoing and planned space missions (including ExoMars, 
JUICE, CHEOPS, PLATO etc.) that support the understanding of the origin 
and evolution of life beyond the Earth. Beside overview talks, 
emphasis will be given on some specific research topics, including 
analogue field activity and planetary protection issues. The meeting 
will consist of two panel discussions: 

1. on how to approach habitability from different disciplines 
(astronomy, biology, chemistry, Earth sciences, philosophy, physics),
and 
2. on trans-domain research in astrobiology (including possible 
contribution to next missions).

[NASA] CALL FOR APPLICATIONS FOR RETURNED SAMPLE SCIENCE BOARD FOR 
MARS 2020

Individuals are invited to apply for membership on the Returned Sample 
Science (RSS) Board for the 2020 Mars science rover mission (hereafter 
Mars 2020). This strategic mission is intended to investigate an 
astrobiologically relevant ancient environment on Mars to decipher its 
geological processes and history, including the assessment of its past 
habitability and potential for preservation of biosignatures within 
accessible geologic materials. The rover also has an objective to 
collect a set of scientifically compelling samples for possible return 
to Earth by a potential future mission. Mission details are available 
at: 

http://mars.nasa.gov/mars2020/mission/overview/
 
Preparation of the most scientifically compelling samples for possible 
future analysis on Earth necessitates careful inputs and community 
engagement, and to this end, the Mars 2020 project will create a board 
of scientists drawn from the diverse array of disciplines likely to be 
involved in the study of returned samples.   
 
To apply submit a 2-page (11-point font, 1-inch margins) Letter of 
Application and a CV by July 15, 2015 to michael.a.meyer@nasa.gov with 
the subject line "Mars 2020 Science Team RSS Board" after having read
