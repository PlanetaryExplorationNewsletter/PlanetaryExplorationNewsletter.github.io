The SETI Institute, with support of the NASA Astrobiology Institute, 
offers travel grants for undergraduate and graduate students to attend 
the IAU 2015 meeting in Honolulu, HI. Awards limited to students 
making oral or poster presentations on themes related to the search 
for life in the universe: astrobiology, exoplanets, planetary systems, 
and bioastronomy. To apply, go to:

NASA POSTDOCTORAL FELLOWSHIPS

The NASA Postdoctoral Program (NPP) provides opportunities for 
scientists and engineers to conduct research largely of their own 
choosing, yet compatible with the research opportunities posted on the 
NPP Web site.

Selected by a competitive peer-review process, NPP Fellows complete 
one- to three-year Fellowship appointments that advance NASA's 
missions in Earth science, heliophysics, astrophysics, planetary 
science, astrobiology, space bioscience, aeronautics and engineering, 
human exploration and operations, and space technology.

An example of one of the research opportunities in planetary science 
is:

https://www3.orau.gov/NPDoc/Catalog/17605

Applicants must have a Ph.D. or equivalent degree in hand before 
beginning the fellowship, but may apply while completing the degree 
requirements. U. S. citizens, Lawful Permanent Residents, and foreign 
nationals eligible for J-1 status as a Research Scholar may apply.

Stipends start at $53,500 per year, with supplements for high 
cost-of-living areas and for certain academic specialties. Financial 
assistance is available for relocation and health insurance, and 
$8,000 per year is provided for professional travel.

Applications are accepted three times each year: March 1, July 1, 
and November 1.

SMALL BODIES ASSESSMENT GROUP 13TH MEETING: REGISTRATION AND LOGISTICS

The 13th meeting of the Small Bodies Assessment Group (SBAG) will be 
held June 29 to midday July 1 in Washington, DC. The website for the 
meeting is now available:

http://www.lpi.usra.edu/sbag/

The website contains logistics information, the current agenda, and 
the opportunity to register. Registration is free but is important for 
planning and to document the community interest in having future

POSTDOC POSITION AVAILABLE: ASTEROID OBSERVATIONS IN THE GAIA ERA

The Laboratory Lagrange at the Observatoire de la Cote d'Azur (Nice, 
France) calls for applications for a Postdoctoral Fellowship funded by 
the French Space Agency (CNES), in the field of solar system science 
connected to Gaia. The position is for one year renewable once, based 
on adequateness of the applicant. The Postdoctoral Fellow will 
contribute to projects that explore data on Solar System objects 
produced by the Gaia mission, and the use of Gaia astrometry for the 
exploitation of Earth-based techniques, e.g stellar occultations, to 
investigate asteroid physical properties.

Qualifications: candidates will be ranked according to their 
achievements in their doctoral research, record of refereed 
publications and independent research abilities. The applicants must 
have earned a Ph.D. degree in physics/astrophysics, with a solid 
background in observational and numerical approaches, good 
interpersonal skills and some experience in working within 
collaborative environments.

Target start date: November 1st, 2015, negotiable.
Deadline for application: July 1st.
