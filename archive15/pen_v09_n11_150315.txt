Radar studies of near-earth asteroids, mapping of planet and 
lunar surfaces, chemical compositions of comets, asteroids, and 
planetary atmospheres, and origins of solar systems, are just 
some of the exciting topics currently being studied through the 
use of large single-dish telescopes. We encourage you to attend 
this workshop and present your ideas on how the large single-dish 
telescopes such as the GBT and Arecibo can best contribute to 
future research in these and other topics, including new and 
improved capabilities and instrumentation.

It would be greatly appreciated if you could indicate your interest 
in attending this workshop by sending an email to 
solarsystem@nrao.edu, along with details of a topic you'd like to 
speak about, if any. Attendance will be limited to roughly 30 people, 
and we aim to provide plenty of time for discussions. We expect the 
agenda to evolve as we hear from potential participants.
