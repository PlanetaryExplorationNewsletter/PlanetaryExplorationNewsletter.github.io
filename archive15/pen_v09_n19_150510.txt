SUMMER SCHOOL: FORMATION AND EVOLUTION OF PLANETARY SYSTEMS AND 
HABITABLE PLANETS

We would like to invite interested researchers and students to apply 
for the summer school “Formation and Evolution of Planetary Systems and 
Habitable Planets”, which will take place in Moletai, Lithuania (close 
to Vilnius) from 21 to 30 August 2015.

The summer school will present an overview of the pathways of formation 
of habitable planets both in our and extrasolar planets. It is co-
organised by the Nordic Network of Astrobiology, the Erasmus+ Strategic 
Partnership "European Astrobiology Campus" and the EU COST Action 
"Origins and Evolution of Life on Earth and in the Universe". Its 
programme includes:

- Lectures by internationally leading scientists covering a broad range 
  of astrobiology
- Observations of star transits as well as other interesting 
  astronomical objects like Churyumov-Gerasimenko comet with the 1.65-m 
  and broad field 51-cm telescope at the Moletai Observatory
- Remote observations using other telescopes in Europe
- 2 Poster sessions for students and early career scientists
- Participant-led discussions about forefront-topics
 
Deadline for application is 15 June 2015.
 
Further information about the event can be found at:

VENUS EXPLORATION ANALYSIS GROUP (VEXAG) CALL FOR EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE 
MEMBERS
 
VEXAG is seeking volunteers for VEXAG Executive Committee members to 
replace those who have successfully completed their service to the 
community. The new members will start this year and their term will 
run for two years.
 
Also, the VEXAG Early Career Scholars Focus Group is looking for 
interested group members.
 
If you are interested, send your resume and a statement of how you 
could contribute to VEXAG to Lori Glaze and Pat Beauchamp, VEXAG Chair 
and Co-Chair (lori.s.glaze@nasa.gov, Patricia.M.Beauchamp@jpl.nasa.gov) 
by June 30, 2015.
 
VEXAG activities for the next two years are expected to be community 
building with an emphasis on:
- Venus Exploration Goals, Objectives, and Strategies
- Technology Development and Laboratory Measurements
- International Collaboration
- Early Career and Young Scholar Development
- Venus International Reference Atmosphere
 
VEXAG is a community-based forum established in July 2005 to assess 
scientific priorities and strategies for exploration of Venus. VEXAG 
is currently composed of a chair and five focus groups, where the 
focus groups actively solicit input from the Venus community on the 
topics listed above.

[NASA] ROSES-15 AMENDMENT 13: RELEASE OF A NEW PROGRAM ELEMENT – 
CITIZEN SCIENCE ASTEROID DATA, EDUCATION, AND TOOLS (CADET)

The Citizen Science Asteroid Data, Education, and Tools (CADET) is a 
joint solicitation of the Near Earth Objects (NEO) Program within 
NASA’s Science Mission Directorate (SMD) and the Asteroid Grand 
Challenge (AGC) Program within NASA’s Office of the Chief Technologist 
(OCT). It seeks innovative proposals to adapt, develop, and web-enable 
software tools for asteroid data analysis and to make them accessible 
and easily usable by nonprofessionals, including amateur astronomers, 
students, and citizen scientists.
 
Step-1 proposals are due by June 15, 2015, and Step-2 proposals are 
due by July 15 2015.

[NASA] ROSES-15 AMENDMENT 14: NEW HOMESTEADER PROGRAM 

The Homesteader Program supports the advanced development of 
technology, including instruments, relevant to mission concepts for 
the next two New Frontiers Announcements of Opportunity (AO). The goal 
of the program is to mature proposed technologies and reduce their 
technical risk such that the accompanying mission concepts are better 
prepared for the next two New Frontiers AOs. 

Note that the Homesteader Program itself does not solicit 
investigations or hardware for a flight opportunity. This Homesteader 
opportunity is open to any technology utilized as part of at least 
one of the seven mission concepts included in the Decadal Survey list 
recommended for the New Frontiers program. It is a priority for NASA 
to invest in technology developments that mitigate the risks of 
mission concept proposals proposed in response to New Frontiers AOs.
 
Mandatory Step-1 proposals are due by June 5, 2015, and full Step-2 
proposals are due by July 20, 2015.

NASA POSTDOCTORAL FELLOWSHIPS
 
The NASA Postdoctoral Program (NPP) provides opportunities for 
scientists and engineers to conduct research largely of their own 
choosing, yet compatible with the research opportunities posted on the 
NPP Web site.
 
Selected by a competitive peer-review process, NPP Fellows complete 
one- to three-year Fellowship appointments that advance NASA’s missions 
in Earth science, heliophysics, astrophysics, planetary science, 
astrobiology, space bioscience, aeronautics and engineering, human 
exploration and operations, and space technology.
 
An example of one of the research opportunities in planetary science 
is:
 
https://www3.orau.gov/NPDoc/Catalog/17903
 
Applicants must have a Ph.D. or equivalent degree in hand before 
beginning the fellowship, but may apply while completing the degree 
requirements. U. S. citizens, Lawful Permanent Residents, and 
foreign nationals eligible for J-1 status as a Research Scholar may 
apply.
 
Stipends start at $53,500 per year, with supplements for high cost-
of-living areas and for certain academic specialties. Financial 
assistance is available for relocation and health insurance, and 
$8,000 per year is provided for professional travel.

Applications are accepted three times each year: March 1, July 1, 
and November 1.
