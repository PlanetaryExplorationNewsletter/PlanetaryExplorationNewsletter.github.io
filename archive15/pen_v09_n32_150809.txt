ICUBESAT 2016 - THE 5TH INTERPLANETARY CUBESAT WORKSHOP

May 24-25, 2016

iCubeSat 2016, the 5th Interplanetary CubeSat Workshop, will address
the technical challenges, opportunities, and practicalities of
interplanetary space exploration with CubeSats. The workshop provides
a unique environment for open wide ranging practical collaboration
between academic researchers, industry professionals, policy makers
and students developing this new and rapidly growing field. The full
call for papers and presentations from previous workshops at Imperial,
Caltech, Cornell and MIT can be found at:

NASA POSTDOCTORAL FELLOWSHIPS

The NASA Postdoctoral Program (NPP) provides opportunities for 
scientists and engineers to conduct research largely of their own 
choosing, yet compatible with the research opportunities posted on 
the NPP Web site.

Selected by a competitive peer-review process, NPP Fellows complete 
one- to three-year Fellowship appointments that advance NASA's 
missions in Earth science, heliophysics, astrophysics, planetary 
science, astrobiology, space bioscience, aeronautics and engineering, 
human exploration and operations, and space technology.

A sample research opportunity in planetary science is:

https://www3.orau.gov/NPDoc/Catalog/18115

Applicants must have a Ph.D. or equivalent degree in hand before 
beginning the fellowship, but may apply while completing the degree 
requirements. U. S. citizens, Lawful Permanent Residents, and foreign 
nationals eligible for J-1 status as a Research Scholar may apply.

Stipends start at $53,500 per year, with supplements for high cost-
of-living areas and for certain academic specialties. Financial 
assistance is available for relocation and health insurance, and 
$8,000 per year is provided for professional travel.

Applications are accepted three times each year: March 1, July 1, 
and November 1.

POSTDOCTORAL POSITION IN MARS ORBITAL DATA ANALYSIS

Applicants are invited for a postdoctoral position associated with
the ERC e-Mars project dedicated to the evolution of Mars from the 
combination of orbital datasets of Mars, located at the laboratory of 
geology of Lyon at the University of Lyon (France). The research 
emphasis will be on Mars geology and surface processes using orbital 
data. Work on mixing morphological observations with spectral analysis 
will be encouraged. Experience in analysis of martian orbital data is 
highly desirable. Other useful skills and experience include remote 
sensing, image processing, DTM processing and exploitation or crater 
counting techniques. Researchers with primary experience in planetary 
geology are welcome.

The appointment period is initially for one year starting autumn 2015. 
Please send a letter of interest, CV including two name potential 
referees, and publication list to Cathy Quantin-Nataf by email 
(cathy.quantin@univ-lyon1.fr).

Please also contact Cathy Quantin-Nataf for any additional details
