USER WORKSHOP FOR MARS CHEMCAM/LIBS DATA AT LPSC

Location: The Woodlands, TX

ChemCam on Curiosity provides a large and varied geochemical dataset 
available for the planetary community including laser-induced 
breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS), passive VIS reflectance spectra, and 
the highest resolution remote micro-images (RMI) from the rover. More 
than 200,000 spectra and over 3,000 images from ChemCam available at 
the Planetary Data System (PDS). More than 30 submitted papers have 
included results from this data. A LIBS instrument is also being 
developed for the Mars 2020 mission.

A 2-1/2-hour workshop will be held during the week of the Lunar and 
Planetary Science Conference (March 15-20, The Woodlands, TX) for 
community members interested in using this dataset. In the workshop 
we will describe the LIBS technique as used on ChemCam and data 
processing for the levels 1 and 2 provided in the PDS, and will 
provide updates on the latest calibration data. We are targeting 
Wednesday evening at 6 pm, subject to conference scheduling. Please 
see the ChemCam website for updates: 

http://msl-chemcam.com

The contact is Roger Wiens (rwiens@lanl.gov).
The ChemCam data can be found at:

http://pds-geosciences.wustl.edu/missions/msl/chemcam.htm

Presentation materials will also be posted on the PDS.

one- to three-year Fellowship appointments that advance NASA’s 
missions in Earth science, heliophysics, astrophysics, planetary 
science, astrobiology, space bioscience, aeronautics and engineering, 
human exploration and operations, and space technology.
 
An example of one of the research opportunities in planetary science 
is:
 
https://www3.orau.gov/NPDoc/Catalog/17903

CALL FOR SUPPORT FOR CASTALIA: A MISSION TO A MAIN BELT COMET

Main Belt Comets (MBCs) constitute a newly identified class of solar 
system objects. They have asteroid-like orbits and some exhibit a 
recurrent comet-like appearance. It is believed that MBCs’ ice 
sublimation-driven activity began recently. Water ice is the only 
volatile expected to survive under an insulating surface. Impacts can 
expose this ice and trigger activity.

A mission proposal, Castalia, will be submitted to ESA by January 
15th. 

Its specific goals are to:

1. Characterize a new Solar System family, the MBCs, by in-situ 
investigation
2. Understand the physics of MBC activity
3. Directly sample water in the asteroid belt and test if MBCs are a 
viable source for Earth's water
4. Use the observed structure of an MBC as a tracer of planetary 
system formation and evolution

These goals can be achieved by a spacecraft orbiting an MBC, sampling 
the released gas and dust. These observations will be particularly 
important in light of recent Rosetta results at Comet 67P. The primary 
target is 133P/Elst-Pizarro.

Castalia's international proposing team would welcome indications of 
support via:

Additional information on Castalia is available at the same site.
