NEW PHD PROGRAM IN ASTRONOMY AND PLANETARY SCIENCE AT NORTHERN ARIZONA
UNIVERSITY

The department of physics and astronomy at Northern Arizona University 
in Flagstaff, Arizona, is very pleased that we are currently accepting 
applications for our new PhD program in astronomy and planetary 
science.

The first group of students will be admitted in the next couple of 
months and begin our new program in August, 2016.

We are looking for excellent students with backgrounds in physics, 
astronomy, planetary science, chemistry, geology, or related fields to 
be part of our inaugural class.

We would appreciate your help in advertising our program to students 
whom you know who are looking for an exciting PhD program with great 
faculty in a beautiful place.

More information about our program can be found on web page at:

http://www.physics.nau.edu/AstroPhD.shtml

The deadline for applications is January 15, 2016.

Interested students may contact me with any questions.

REGISTER TODAY FOR THE 2016 HUMANS TO MARS (H2M) SUMMIT

Join us at the Humans to Mars (H2M) Summit that will be held from 
May 17-19, 2016 at The George Washington University in Washington, DC.  

H2M is an annual Mars exploration conference that addresses the major 
technical, scientific, and policy challenges that need to be overcome 
in order to send humans to Mars by the 2030s. It is the most 
comprehensive conference in the world focused on landing humans on 
Mars, and the 2016 H2M is shaping up to be the biggest H2M yet.

Confirmed and tentative speakers already include Dava Newman, Andrew 
Weir (Author, The Martian) Ellen Stofan, Bill Nye ("The Science Guy"), 
James Green, Miles O'Brien (PBS, CNN), Penelope Boston, 'Astronaut 
Abby' Harrison, Joe Cassady (Aerojet Rocketdyne), Harley Thronson (NASA 
Goddard), and many more.

EGU 2016 SESSION PS1.5: SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY FOR THE ASTEROID IMPACT 
AND DEFLECTION ASSESSMENT (AIDA) MISSION

Please consider submitting an abstract for the session PS1.5 "Science 
and Technology for the Asteroid Impact & Deflection Assessment (AIDA) 
Mission" at the EGU General Assembly 2016 (deadline: 13 January 2016, 
13:00 CET).

This session invites contributions about the expected scientific output 
of the AIDA mission, supporting ground-based observations, asteroid and 
impact modeling, and new technology and instrumentation for asteroid 
exploration. More information can be found at:

[NASA] DUE DATE FOR COMMENTS ON THE SMD STANDARD AO EXTENDED TO 
JANUARY 15, 2016

The Science Mission Directorate (SMD) has extended the open period for 
comments on the Standard Announcement of Opportunity (AO) until 
January 15, 2016. 

For reference information regarding the current Standard AO Template 
and a copy of the previous message inviting comments please see:

Modifications that could result in shortening and/or simplifying Step 1 
proposals submitted for two-step flight mission acquisitions and other 
suggestions may be submitted via email by January 15, 2016 to Thomas 
Wagner at thomas.wagner@nasa.gov and Washito Sasamoto at

[NASA] JWST EARLY RELEASE SCIENCE PROGRAM REQUEST

The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is scheduled for launch in 
October 2018, and the first call for proposals will be released in 
2017. The Space Telescope Science Institute, following the 
recommendations of the JWST Advisory Committee is now defining the 
parameters for an Early Release Science (ERS) program. See:

http://www.stsci.edu/jwst/advisory-committee/JSTAC-Recommendations
_ERS_CF.pdf

The primary objective of the ERS program is to provide community access 
to a broad suite of JWST science observations as early as possible in 
Cycle 1. The observing programs will be chosen by peer review to provide 
representative datasets and to address technical challenges related to 
the major instrumental modes available on JWST. ERS observations are 
expected to seed initial discovery and to inform Cycle 2 proposals, 
which will be submitted just months after the start of Cycle 1.

We are gathering input to inform our preparations for the program 
through a brief survey at:

http://goo.gl/forms/lR0rHG4H4o

The survey will be open until 15 January 2016. It takes 10-15 minutes 
to complete. More information on the general framework and timeline for 
the ERS program can be found on the ERS webpage: 

http://www.stsci.edu/jwst/science/ers 

Questions are welcome via email: jwst_ers@stsci.edu
