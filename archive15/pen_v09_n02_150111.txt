PLANETARY SCIENCE SLIDES AND ILLUSTRATIONS

Are you looking for some great slides or illustrations to use in your 
presentations? The Planetary Science Research Discoveries website has 
sets of Powerpoint slides. These are summaries of PSRD articles 
covering the origin of solar systems and the processes by which 
planets, moons, and small bodies form and evolve. The slides are 
annotated with captions and notes, and are linked to PSRD articles 
that provide the full context, additional graphics, and references. 
New content added monthly. Use our search box to find just what you 
need.

http://www.psrd.hawaii.edu/Archive/Archive-PSRDpresents.html

The Cosmochemistry Illustrated website offers Powerpoint slides with 
planetary examples to enrich geochemistry, petrology, and introductory 
geology lectures. References and background are given in the notes 
pages.

PLANETARY SURFACE PROCESSES FIELD SCHOOL

There are still a handful of remaining places for the Planetary 
Surfaces Processes Field School being run by the Centre for Planetary 
Science and Exploration (CPSX) at The University of Western Ontario, 
Canada. This graduate level course will run May 12-22 2015 in 
various sites in northern Arizona and southern Utah. The principal 
objective of this course is to provide participants with an 
interdisciplinary field studies experience with an emphasis on 
planetary surface processes. This course will introduce students from 
a wide range of backgrounds to processes that shape the surface of the 
Earth and other terrestrial planets. Emphasis will be placed on 
volcanism, impact cratering, tectonics, and fluvial and aeolian 
processes. Full details of the course are at:

-science-fieldschool 

For questions, contact the course instructor:
Dr. Gordon "Oz" Osinski at gosinski@uwo.ca.

NASA POSTDOCTORAL FELLOWSHIPS

The NASA Postdoctoral Program (NPP) provides opportunities for 
scientists and engineers to conduct research largely of their own 
choosing, yet compatible with the research opportunities posted on 
the NPP Web site.

Selected by a competitive peer-review process, NPP Fellows complete 
one- to three-year Fellowship appointments that advance NASA's 
missions in Earth science, heliophysics, astrophysics, planetary 
science, astrobiology, space bioscience, aeronautics and engineering, 
human exploration and operations, and space technology.

A sample research opportunities is:

https://www3.orau.gov/NPDoc/Catalog/18395    

Applicants must have a Ph.D. or equivalent degree in hand before 
beginning the fellowship, but may apply while completing the degree 
requirements. U. S. citizens, Lawful Permanent Residents, and foreign 
nationals eligible for J-1 status as a Research Scholar may apply.

Stipends start at $53,500 per year, with supplements for high cost-
of-living areas and for certain academic specialties. Financial 
assistance is available for relocation and health insurance, and 
$8,000 per year is provided for professional travel.

Applications are accepted three times each year: March 1, July 1, and 
November 1.

CSWA SURVEY ON WORKPLACE CLIMATE

The AAS Committee on the Status of Women in Astronomy (CSWA) is 
conducting a survey on Workplace Climate. The CSWA wants to learn if 
members of the astronomical and/or planetary communities encounter 
negative language, or experience verbal or physical altercations on 
the basis of gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, ability 
status, or race and ethnicity. The survey is designed to request 
information during the respondent's current position and previous 
position (if the respondent has changed positions within the last 
five years). This information is requested in order to understand 
if astronomers and planetary scientists encounter varying workplace 
climates at different stages of their career.

Please help us in our pursuit to better understand how workplace 
climate impacts the members of the astronomical community. Go to:

https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/CSWA_Workplace_Climate_Survey 

to complete a confidential survey. We appreciate your input and 
welcome participation from all members of the astronomical and 
planetary scientist community over the age of 18.
