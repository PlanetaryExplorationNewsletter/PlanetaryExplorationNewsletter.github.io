strengths or open new areas for Lowell. A Ph.D. in astronomy, 
planetary science, or a related field is required, as is an 
outstanding record of research and demonstrated ability or potential 
to obtain external research funding. Candidates are invited to 
describe how they would make use of our observational facilities, 
but we will give equal consideration to all research areas. The start 
date for this position is flexible but desired by Fall 2016.

Additional position details can be found at:

SBAG 14 EARLY CAREER TRAVEL SUPPORT

The SBAG 14 meeting is scheduled for January 27-29, 2016 in Pasadena, 
CA. Logistical details for the specific location are still in the 
process of being finalized, and we anticipate having a draft agenda 
on the SBAG website in early October. 

We are planning to offer limited U.S. travel support for early career 
scientists to participate in the SBAG 14 meeting. Interested 
graduate students, postdocs, and other early career scientists 
(within 3 years of PhD/MS/BS) should submit a letter and a CV to 
SBAG Early Career Secretary Angela Stickle (angela.stickle at 
jhuapl.edu) by October 21, 2015. Included in the letter, which 
must not exceed 2 pages, should be a demonstration of financial need 
and an explanation of how the applicant's work relates to the 
purposes of SBAG. The letter and CV should be combined into a single 
PDF document for submission by e-mail attachment. Recipients of 
travel support will be expected to give a short presentation of their 
SBAG-relevant work at the SBAG 14 meeting. Please pass this 
opportunity on to appropriate individuals.

ENABLING TRANSITING EXOPLANET SCIENCE WITH JWST WORKSHOP

November 16-18, 2015
Space Telescope Science Institute, Baltimore, Maryland

This workshop will provide a forum for the exoplanet community to 
learn about and discuss the capabilities of JWST to characterize 
transiting exoplanets. Talks will inform potential observers about 
the cutting edge science that JWST will enable. Discussion sessions 
will allow for community dialog on how best to enable exoplanet 
science with JWST. As JWST proposal opportunities approach, this 
workshop will serve as an important opportunity to understand how 
JWST will impact the field of exoplanet science. 

Registration closes October 16th, 2015.

NASA POSTDOCTORAL FELLOWSHIPS

The NASA Postdoctoral Program (NPP) provides opportunities for 
scientists and engineers to conduct research largely of their own 
choosing, yet compatible with the research opportunities posted on 
the NPP Web site.

Selected by a competitive peer-review process, NPP Fellows complete 
one- to three-year Fellowship appointments that advance NASA's 
missions in Earth science, heliophysics, astrophysics, planetary 
science, astrobiology, space bioscience, aeronautics and engineering, 
human exploration and operations, and space technology.

A sample research opportunities is:

https://apps.orau.gov/NPDoc/Catalog/18818

Applicants must have a Ph.D. or equivalent degree in hand before 
beginning the fellowship, but may apply while completing the degree 
requirements. U. S. citizens, Lawful Permanent Residents, and foreign 
nationals eligible for J-1 status as a Research Scholar may apply.

Stipends start at $53,500 per year, with supplements for high cost-
of-living areas and for certain academic specialties. Financial 
assistance is available for relocation and health insurance, and 
$8,000 per year is provided for professional travel.

Applications are accepted three times each year: March 1, July 1, 
and November 1.
