EDUCATION AND OUTREACH “HELP DESK” FOR SCIENTISTS INTERESTED IN 
INCREASING THEIR IMPACT

This year at the 46th LPSC the Planetary Science Forum will reprise 
its popular “Help Desk” for scientists. Are you teaching an 
introductory class this semester and looking for new ideas? Have 
questions about evaluation? Want to learn more about how to engage 
students in your child’s classroom? Looking for resources and 
contacts to expand your current outreach efforts in science, 
technology, engineering, art and math (STEAM)? Interested in 
education and outreach, but are not sure where to start? Visit the 
“Help Desk” on Monday, March 16, 2:30 to 5:00 pm, or Wednesday, 
March 18, 12:00 to 1:30 pm, in the Indian Springs Room. Inform us in 
advance of your interest at:

http://doodle.com/8u2ku8gxkw56xqgz 

to ensure adequate resources, or just drop in. For more information, 
contact Jennifer Grier at jgrier@psi.edu.

LPSC PERIPHERAL MEETING 

Conducting Planetary Science from Stratospheric Balloon Platforms

Day: Wednesday
Date: 3/18/2015
Start Time: 5:30 PM
End Time: 7:30 PM
Room: Waterway 1-3

We will discuss scientific ballooning for conducting planetary science 
to better understand how these platforms could serve the community and 
to help the planetary science community better understand the 
characteristics of this potential capability. These platforms may 
offer a low barrier to entry opportunity for both new and established 
researchers to conduct their own measurement campaigns and missions. 
At this meeting, we will describe these mission capabilities, the 
general nature of scientific ballooning, mission/instrument 
considerations, and the potential opportunities these platforms offer 
to the planetary science community.

SCIENTIST PROGRAM

This solicitation is for Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) Participating 
Scientist (PS) investigations to enhance the scientific return from 
the mission by broadening participation in the mission to include new 
investigations that broaden and/or complement the funded Principal 
Investigator (PI)-led instrument investigations, thus maximizing the 
contribution of MSL to the future exploration and scientific 
understanding of Mars. Participating Scientist proposals may include 
investigations that are instrument specific or multiinstrument in 
nature and, in all cases, must include both science analysis and an 
operational component (commitment to participate in daily operations)
in order to be considered. Existing Participating Scientists and their 
PS investigation team members, if they are interested in continuing as 
Participating Scientists, must propose and successfully re-compete.
Mandatory Step-1 proposals are due by May 6, 2015, and full Step-2 
proposals are due by June 3, 2015.

This Amendment will be posted on the NASA research opportunity

funding within the NASA Planetary Science Division budget. Any costs 
incurred by prospective investigators in preparing submissions in 
response to this CAN are incurred completely at the submitter's own 
risk.

A preproposal conference will be held no less than 2 weeks after 
release of the CAN to provide interested parties with the opportunity 
to better understand the intent, scope, and selection criteria of 
this CAN. Information about the preproposal conference will be posted

[NASA] MINORITY UNIVERSITY RESEARCH AND EDUCATION PROJECT (MUREP) 
AEROSPACE ACADEMY

NASA has announced the Education Opportunities in NASA STEM (EONS) 
2014 Amendment 11 for the NASA Minority University Research and 
Education Project (MUREP) Aerospace Academy.
 
MUREP solicits proposals from Minority Serving Institutions (MSIs) to 
create and implement a NASA MUREP Aerospace Academy (MAA) to increase 
participation and retention of historically underserved and 
underrepresented K-12 youth in the areas of Science, Technology, 
Engineering and Mathematics (STEM).

The MAA seeks proposals from MSIs to develop new exciting avenues for 
attracting students to STEM fields. MAA development establishes a 
pipeline as well as a mechanism for K-12 learners to be inspired,

[NASA] EMERGING WORLDS PROGRAM ELEMENT CLARIFICATION

NASA has clarified ROSES-2015 program element C.2  Emerging Worlds in 
a couple of ways: The first paragraph of program element C.2 Emerging 
Worlds was updated to better align with the 2014 Science Plan, and 
Section 2.3 on award duration and size was updated to clarify what 
kind of justification is required from proposers seeking awards more 
than three years in duration and   based on recent selections from 
ROSES-2014 it was noted that the average award size for EW was $150K, 
but with a very wide range depending on the nature of the work. 

More information will be presented in an upcoming FAQ for EW. The due 
dates remain unchanged.Questions regarding this program element should 
be directed to Jeff Grossman at jeffrey.n.grossman@mail.nasa.gov.
