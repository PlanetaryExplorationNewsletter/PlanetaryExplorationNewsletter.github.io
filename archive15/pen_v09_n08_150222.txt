[NASA] PDS CAN ANNOUNCEMENT AND SCHEDULE

The Planetary Science Division intends to release a (CAN) for the 
Discipline Nodes of the Planetary Data System (PDS) by March 2015. 

The overall goal of this solicitation is to establish a network of 
organizations to serve as Discipline Nodes. NASA is planning on 
selecting one or more proposals that outline a design to create an 
active and creative interface between mission providers, the science 
community and the NASA Planetary Data System (PDS). Proposals may be 
submitted by individual organizations or consortia of organizations 
with one of the member organizations serving as the lead or primary 
applicant. Consistent with the use of the PDS4 archiving standard, 
consortia proposing to this CAN may define their own unique, creative, 
and agile approaches to achieving the goal of the solicitation.

Proposers to the CAN are not required to replicate the existing 
organization.

The time frame for the solicitation is intended to be:
* Release of CAN: March 2015 (target)
* Preproposal conference: 14 days after CAN release
* Step 1 Proposals due: No less than 30 days after CAN release
* Step 2 Proposals due: 90 days after CAN release
* Selection: July 2015 (target)

Further information will be posted at:

INVITATION TO RAS MEETING ON THE MOON, MERCURY AND ASTEROIDS

Dear colleagues,

We invite you to our Royal Astronomical Society (RAS) Specialist 
Discussion Meeting titled 'Spectroscopy of Airless Bodies in 
Wavelengths from the Visible to the Microwave: Orbital, Telescopic, 
and/or Laboratory Measurements Relevant to Mercury, the Moon and 
Asteroids' on 10th April 2015 at Burlington House in London, UK.

Airless planetary bodies like Mercury, the Moon and asteroids provide 
a unique opportunity for studying the formation and evolution of 
planetary surfaces, as there is no weather or liquid water altering 
their surfaces. Using the individual strengths of each spectroscopic 
technique, the composition of a planet's surface can be determined 
through the identification of spectrally dominant minerals exposed at 
the surface. Our current knowledge of surface compositions come from 
the analyses of:

1) remotely sensed data from spacecraft and telescopes and 
2) laboratory measurements of returned sample material or analogues.  

Join us for a day of discussion on all things spectroscopic of the 
airless bodies!

A provisional schedule is now online at: 

http://users.ox.ac.uk/~phys0722/Home.html

If you would like to present a poster at this meeting please email 
DonaldsonHanna@atm.ox.ac.uk BEFORE 9th March 2015.

Best Regards,
Kerri Donaldson Hanna, Neil Bowles, Simon Green and Stephen Lowry

NASA POSTDOCTORAL FELLOWSHIPS

The NASA Postdoctoral Program (NPP) provides opportunities for 
scientists and engineers to conduct research largely of their own 
choosing, yet compatible with the research opportunities posted on 
the NPP Web site.

Selected by a competitive peer-review process, NPP Fellows complete 
one- to three-year Fellowship appointments that advance NASA's missions 
in Earth science, heliophysics, astrophysics, planetary science, 
astrobiology, space bioscience, aeronautics and engineering, human 
exploration and operations, and space technology.

A sample opportunity in planetary science is:

https://www3.orau.gov/NPDoc/Catalog/18115

Applicants must have a Ph.D. or equivalent degree in hand before 
beginning the fellowship, but may apply while completing the degree 
requirements. U. S. citizens, Lawful Permanent Residents, and 
foreign nationals eligible for J-1 status as a Research Scholar 
may apply.

Stipends start at $53,500 per year, with supplements for high 
cost-of-living areas and for certain academic specialties. 
Financial assistance is available for relocation and health 
insurance, and $8,000 per year is provided for professional travel.

Applications are accepted three times each year: March 1, July 1, 
and November 1.
