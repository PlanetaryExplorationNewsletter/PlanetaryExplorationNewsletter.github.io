AEOLIAN RESEARCH SPECIAL ISSUE FOR THE FOURTH INTERNATIONAL PLANETARY 
DUNES WORKSHOP

The Fourth International Planetary Dunes Workshop: Integrating Models, 
Remote Sensing, and Field Data was held May 19–22, 2015 in Boise, Idaho 
(see Final Announcement). More than 60 researchers and students 
participated in two and a half days of presentations and lively 
discussion, plus a full day field trip toBruneau Dunes State Park. The 
workshop focused on the many landforms and deposits created by the 
dynamic interactions between granular material and airflow (aeolian 
processes). These processes are known to occur on several planetary 
bodies, including Earth, Mars, Titan, Venus, and most recently the 
surface of a comet. 

A special issue in Aeolian Research is planned to highlight the results 
presented at the workshop, in addition to other recent aeolian studies 
of planetary surfaces. Manuscripts on any topic within planetary 
aeolian studies are solicited, but those focusing on planetary dune 
systems are particularly encouraged. While terrestrial analog studies 
are welcome for the special issue, these manuscripts should include 
discussion of how the results relate to the analysis of features in 
planetary environments. 

Please send an email (as an indication of interest) that includes a 
working title, proposed author list, and two-sentence description of 
the manuscript to chojan1@pirl.lpl.arizona.edu by August 29, 2015. 
Deadline for submission of final manuscripts is February 1, 2016.

AGU SESSION 7445 - VOLCANISM AND TECTONISM ACROSS THE SOLAR SYSTEM

There will be a session on planetary volcanism and tectonism at this 
year's AGU Fall Meeting, 14-18 December. Please consider submitting an 
abstract for this session. Further details are provided below. 

The submission deadline is Wednesday, August 5, 2015. 

https://agu.confex.com/agu/fm15/preliminaryview.cgi/Session7445 

Volcanism and tectonism are two of the most ubiquitous processes at 
work in the Solar System, shaping substantially the surfaces of worlds 
as diverse as the terrestrial planets, main-belt asteroids, and icy 
satellites. Through a combination of solicited and contributed 
presentations, this session will host observational, laboratory, 
theoretical, or analogue fieldwork research into any aspect of 
planetary volcanic and tectonic activity. We particularly welcome 
submissions that compare landforms and processes on multiple bodies, 
and how lessons from specific studies can be applied to understanding 
volcanism and tectonism across the Solar System.

AGU SESSION 8599 - SCIENCE FROM CURRENT AND FUTURE PLANETARY MISSIONS

We solicit new results from planetary missions, or design studies that 
target planetary bodies inside or outside of our solar system, with a 
special focus on science that can only be achieved through 
international cooperation. This includes mission concepts that 
identify room for internationally contributed science investigations, 
and instrument concepts that could be contributed to international 
missions. A topical interest of our session is the science addressed by

AGU SESSION 8728 - VESTA AND CERES AS SEEN BY DAWN AND EARTH-BASED 
INSTRUMENTS

There will be a session on the largest two planetary bodies within the 
main asteroid belt at this year’s AGU Fall Meeting, 14-18 December 2015. 
Though the session is focussed on Ceres and Vesta, presentations on 
recent advances in small body research are welcome.

Please consider submitting an abstract for this session. Further 
details are provided below.

Abstract submission deadline is 5 August 2015.
 
https://agu.confex.com/agu/fm15/preliminaryview.cgi/Session8728

Ceres and Vesta are the largest bodies in the main asteroid belt. 
Unlocking their geological histories will advance our understanding 
of how proto-planets form and evolve. This session is focused on Dawn 
mission data and its three onboard instruments: two framing cameras 
(FC), the visible and IR spectrometer (VIR), and the gamma-ray and 
neutron spectrometer (GRaND). First results from Ceres observations 
constitute the highlights of this session supplemented by thorough 
investigations on Vesta geology. Complementary Earth-based (ground 
and orbital) observations along with laboratory, numerical, and 
theoretical applications and analyses are particular welcome.

AGU SESSION P003 - DIRECT IMAGING OF HABITABLE EXOPLANETS: PROGRESS 
AND FUTURE

This session consists in a discussion on the potential of new and 
future facilities and modeling efforts designed to detect, image and 
characterize habitable exoplanets, studying their formation, evolution 
and also the existence of possible biospheres. Topics to be covered 
in this session include signs of exoplanet habitability and global 
biosignatures that can be sought with upcoming instrumentation; 
instrument requirements and technologies to detect these markers; 
strategies for target selection and prioritization; and impacts of 
planetary system properties, ground-based and space telescope 
architectures, and impacts of instrument capabilities on the yield of 
potentially inhabited exoplanets.

AGU SESSION P029 - SOLAR SYSTEM SMALL BODIES: RELICS OF FORMATION AND 
NEW WORLDS TO EXPLORE

The composition and physical properties of Small Solar System Bodies 
(SSSBs), remnants of the formation of planets, are key to better 
understand our solar system. Increased knowledge of their surface 
properties and their potential as resources are also necessary to 
prepare for robotic and human exploration. Hints about the internal 
structure and composition of SSSBs have been acquired recently thanks 
to flyby/rendezvous data from space missions, study of complex multiple 
asteroid systems, or close encounter between asteroids. This session 
welcomes abstracts on the remarkable results bringing information on 
the internal structure and composition of SSSBs based on space and 
ground-based data, numerical models, AS WELL AS instrument/mission 
concepts in the prospect of future exploration.
