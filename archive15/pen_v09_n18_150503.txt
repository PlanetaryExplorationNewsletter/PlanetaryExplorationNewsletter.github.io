POSTDOCTORAL RESEARCH IN CORE/OCEAN GEOMAGNETISM

(NASA-GSFC/CRESST/University of Maryland)

Applications are now being accepted for a Postdoctoral Associate, 
funded through the University of Maryland College Park and the Center 
for Research and Exploration in Space Science and Technology (CRESST), 
to work in the Planetary Geodynamics Laboratory of the NASA Goddard 
Space Flight Center in the area of core/ocean geomagnetism. Additional 
details are available at: 

http://www.astro.umd.edu/employment/index.html#Geomag

Applicants must have a Ph.D. degree (or expect to have the degree by 
the start of the appointment) in a related field of physics, 
geophysics, dynamical oceanography/meteorology, and/or applied 
mathematics. Applicants are expected to have strong quantitative 
analysis and modeling skills - in addition to knowledge of geomagnetic 
fields, satellite or ground observatory data, geomagnetic field models, 
and core dynamics. Familiarity with UNIX OS, FORTRAN, and parallel 
computing is a strong plus.

The University of Maryland is an Affirmative Action, Equal Opportunity 
Employer. Women and minorities are encouraged to apply. All 
applications received by May 22, 2015 will receive full consideration.

OPAG WEBSITE

The OPAG website has a new look and has been re-organized. Check it out 
at: 

http://www.lpi.usra.edu/opag/  

Have fun exploring!

In particular we now have an OPAG Discussion Board, that can be 
reached by clicking on "OPAG Discussion Board" in the menu list on the 
left of the homepage. We now have a place to communicate and share our 
thoughts and ideas.

If you haven't signed up to receive OPAG newsletters just fill out the 
"Indication of Interest" form, at:

SMALL BODIES ASSESSMENT GROUP 13TH MEETING: ANNOUNCEMENTS

The 13th meeting of the Small Bodies Assessment Group (SBAG) will be 
held June 29 to midday July 1 in Washington, DC. A draft agenda has 
been posted on the SBAG website:

http://www.lpi.usra.edu/sbag/

The SBAG 13 meeting will use the NASA Conference Tracking System 
(NCTS). If you plan to attend and use NCTS for your travels, please 
register ASAP. Details: NCTS# 22158-15 - 13th Meeting of the NASA 
Small Bodies Assessment Group (SBAG), 06/29/15, Washington, DC

Logistical details for the meeting hotel and registration website are 
still being finalized. Presentations from additional small body 
related proposed Discovery mission concepts are still welcome. 
Please email Nancy Chabot to get added to this section of the agenda.

NASA POSTDOCTORAL FELLOWSHIPS

The NASA Postdoctoral Program (NPP) provides opportunities for 
scientists and engineers to conduct research largely of their own 
choosing, yet compatible with the research opportunities posted on the 
NPP Web site.

Selected by a competitive peer-review process, NPP Fellows complete 
one- to three-year Fellowship appointments that advance NASA's missions 
in Earth science, heliophysics, astrophysics, planetary science, 
astrobiology, space bioscience, aeronautics and engineering, human 
exploration and operations, and space technology.

An example of one of the research opportunities in planetary science 
is:

https://www3.orau.gov/NPDoc/Catalog/18610

Applicants must have a Ph.D. or equivalent degree in hand before 
beginning the fellowship, but may apply while completing the degree 
requirements. U. S. citizens, Lawful Permanent Residents, and foreign 
nationals eligible for J-1 status as a Research Scholar may apply.

Stipends start at $53,500 per year, with supplements for high 
cost-of-living areas and for certain academic specialties. Financial 
assistance is available for relocation and health insurance, and 
$8,000 per year is provided for professional travel.

Applications are accepted three times each year: March 1, July 1, and 
November 1.

EPSC 2015: VOLCANISM AND TECTONISM ACROSS THE SOLAR SYSTEM

There will be a session on planetary volcanism and tectonism (TP9) at 
this year's European Planetary Science Congress in Nantes, France, 
September 27-October 2, 2015.

Volcanism and tectonism are two of the most ubiquitous processes at 
work in the Solar System, shaping substantially the surfaces of worlds 
as diverse as the terrestrial planets, main-belt asteroids, and icy 
satellites. Through a combination of solicited and contributed 
presentations, this session will host observational, laboratory, 
theoretical, or analogue fieldwork research into any aspect of 
planetary volcanic and tectonic activity. We particularly welcome 
submissions that compare landforms and processes on multiple bodies, 
and how lessons from specific studies can be applied to understanding 
volcanism and tectonism across the Solar System.

Please consider submitting an abstract for this session. For more 
information, visit: 

http://meetingorganizer.copernicus.org/EPSC2015/session/19630

The submission deadline is next Wednesday, May 6, 2015.

Conveners:

Paul Byrne, Thomas Platz, Matteo Massironi, and Harald Hiesinger

We look forward to seeing you in Nantes.
