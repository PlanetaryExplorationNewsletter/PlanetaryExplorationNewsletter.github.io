JOB OPENINGS AT SPACE TELESCOPE SCIENCE INSTITUTE

https://rn11.ultipro.com/SPA1004/JobBoard/JobDetails.aspx?__ID
=*2357526FC6D627A1

The Space Telescope Science Institute (STScI) has multiple openings 
(ranging from entry level to highly experienced) for Analysts and 
Scientists in our Instruments and Operations and Engineering 
Divisions. Research and Instrument Analysts (RIAs) will assist 
Instrument Scientists in the operational and developmental support 
for Hubble Space Telescope, James Webb Space Telescope, and Wide-Field 
InfraRed Survey Telescope missions. Science Operations Analysts 
support science planning and scheduling operations for the Hubble 
Space Telescope and testing of the James Webb Space Telescope science 
planning and scheduling ground system. Archive Analysts are responsible 
for processing and archiving science and engineering data from the 
Hubble Space Telescope, the Kepler spacecraft and soon the James Webb 
Space Telescope. Archive Scientists provide scientific, technical, 
computational expertise and support in the areas of archive operations, 
data processing operations, archival research, and problem 
investigation and analysis.

Due to growing interest in the First Landing Site (LS)/Exploration 
Zone (EZ) Workshop for Human Missions to the Surface of Mars, the 
organizers would like to allow those submitting Exploration Zone (EZ) 
and Landing Site (LS) proposals more time to prepare their abstracts 
in support of this unique and innovative effort.

The deadline for abstracts been extended until:

If you've already submitted an abstract and would like to replace it, 
or correct the information submitted on the form, return to the 
abstract submission portion of the meeting portal and click on the 
"Update" link that appears next to the title of your abstract before 
the new deadline.

Applications to attend are also now being accepted. Instructions 
and details can be found on the workshop website.

Travel support:
Limited support for travel will be made available for U.S. 
participants. Details will be posted on the workshop website as 
soon as they become available.

NASA employees and contractors should note that this workshop is 
classified as a conference and therefore NASA Conference Tracking 
(NCTS) rules apply.

NASA POSTDOCTORAL FELLOWSHIPS

The NASA Postdoctoral Program (NPP) provides opportunities for 
scientists and engineers to conduct research largely of their own 
choosing, yet compatible with the research opportunities posted on 
the NPP Web site.

Selected by a competitive peer-review process, NPP Fellows complete 
one- to three-year Fellowship appointments that advance NASA's 
missions in Earth science, heliophysics, astrophysics, planetary 
science, astrobiology, space bioscience, aeronautics and engineering, 
human exploration and operations, and space technology.

A sample opportunity in planetary science is: 

https://apps.orau.gov/NPDoc/Catalog/18818

Applicants must have a Ph.D. or equivalent degree in hand before 
beginning the fellowship, but may apply while completing the degree 
requirements. U. S. citizens, Lawful Permanent Residents, and foreign 
nationals eligible for J-1 status as a Research Scholar may apply.

Stipends start at $53,500 per year, with supplements for high cost-
of-living areas and for certain academic specialties. Financial 
assistance is available for relocation and health insurance, and 
$8,000 per year is provided for professional travel.

Applications are accepted three times each year: March 1, July 1, 
and November 1.

COMPARATIVE CLIMATES CONFERENCE TO BE STREAMED LIVE

We are happy to announce livestream capabilities for the upcoming 
"Comparative Climates of Terrestrial Planets II: Understanding How 
Climate Systems Work" conference (CCTP2). The meeting will be streamed 
live via Adobe Connect, at:

https://ac.arc.nasa.gov/cctp2/ 

from September 8-11. The program for the meeting - with times listed 
in PDT - is available at: 

http://sservi3.arc.nasa.gov/downloads/cctp2_program.pdf 

The first CCTP meeting, held in 2012, fostered a series of 
interdisciplinary conversations on a wide range of planetary climates.  
We are planning for a similar range of conversations at the CCTP2 
meeting, including the effects of the Sun and other stars on the 
climates of Earth and other planets in and beyond the Solar System. 
We encourage you to listen to the conversations we foster at CCTP-2, 
and to extend them via the Adobe Connect chat room. This meeting is 
supported by NASA's Science Mission Directorate (SMD). For more 
information and future updates on the meeting, please go to the 
CCTP 2 website:

SWEA, MAG, in situ Key Parameters, and ancillary data. The data 
presently available were collected between the start of MAVEN's 
science operations on November 15, 2014, and May 15, 2015. The SDC 
also contains interactive browse plots, a form for searching and 
downloading data, a list of mission events, and an IDL toolkit for 
retrieving and visualizing data.

undergraduates and graduate students; a demonstrated record of
publications and/or extramural funding in astronomy and/or planetary
science; evidence of high quality teaching and commitment to student
success; expertise in exoplanets, astro-informatics, astro-chemistry,
astronomical instrumentation, and/or observational astronomy
specializing in Solar System objects, exoplanets, or related topics;
and the ability to work with students, colleagues, and community
members from diverse cultures. The search will remain open until the
position is filled or closed; however, the screening committee will

REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL POSTED FOR MARS 2020 LANDING SITE CHARACTERIZATION

The Mars Exploration Program has issued, in August 2015, a Request 
for Proposal for round X of the Mars Critical Data Products program 

http://mepag.nasa.gov/cdp.cfm

This RFP provides support for landing site surface and atmosphere 
characterization for the Mars 2020 rover mission. The intent is to 
convert mission data and numerical simulations into products focused 
on specific landing site targets (to be provided by the program) that 
will be useful for reducing the risk to the Mars 2020 rover mission. 

Details of this RFP are posted at:

https://acquisition.jpl.nasa.gov/rfp/NT-2692-081715/default.htm

or 

https://acquisition.jpl.nasa.gov/bizops/

Requested data products are for:
(1) Radar Reflectivity, 
(2) Surface Thermophysical Properties, 
(3) Surface Pressure Predictions, and 
(4) Dust Events during Mars 2020 Entry Descent and Landing (EDL). 

Proposals are due Wednesday, October 14, 2015, 3:00 PM (Pacific).
