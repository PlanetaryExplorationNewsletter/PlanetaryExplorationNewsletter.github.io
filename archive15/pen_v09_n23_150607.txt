SCIENCE COMMUNICATION WORKSHOP

The RIS4E SSERVI Team and experts from the Alan Alda Center for 
Communicating Science a world-renowned leader in the field of science
communication, will facilitate a (free!) Science Communication 
Workshop on Sunday, July 19 at NASA Ames, right before the SSERVI 
Exploration Science Forum. The Alda Center has helped hundreds of 
scientists around the country improve their communication skills and 
are in high demand by universities and professional agencies 
nationwide, including NASA's Office of the Chief Scientist. 

This one-day workshop is designed to help scientists learn to connect 
with different audiences and to convey the meaning of complex 
material in vivid, clear language those audiences can understand.

NASA POSTDOCTORAL FELLOWSHIPS

The NASA Postdoctoral Program (NPP) provides opportunities for 
scientists and engineers to conduct research largely of their own 
choosing, yet compatible with the research opportunities posted on 
the NPP Web site.

Selected by a competitive peer-review process, NPP Fellows complete 
one- to three-year Fellowship appointments that advance NASA's 
missions in Earth science, heliophysics, astrophysics, planetary 
science, astrobiology, space bioscience, aeronautics and engineering, 
human exploration and operations, and space technology.
 
A sample research opportunity is:

https://www3.orau.gov/NPDoc/Catalog/17702  

Applicants must have a Ph.D. or equivalent degree in hand before 
beginning the fellowship, but may apply while completing the degree 
requirements. U. S. citizens, Lawful Permanent Residents, and 
foreign nationals eligible for J-1 status as a Research Scholar 
may apply.

Stipends start at $53,500 per year, with supplements for high 
cost-of-living areas and for certain academic specialties. 
Financial assistance is available for relocation and health 
insurance, and $8,000 per year is provided for professional 
travel.

Applications are accepted three times each year: March 1, July 1, 
and November 1.

LUNAR AND SMALL BODIES GRADUATE CONFERENCE 2015 - ANNOUNCEMENT
AND ABSTRACT SUBMISSION DEADLINE

Registration is now open for the 6th Annual Lunar and Small Bodies 
Graduate Conference (LunGradCon 2015) to be held on Monday, July 20, 
2015 at the NASA Ames Research Center, preceding the NASA Exploration 
Science Forum (ESF). With the expanded interests of the Solar System 
Exploration Research Virtual Institute (SSERVI), the scope of this 
year's LunGradCon is expanded to include both lunar and small bodies 
science. LunGradCon provides an opportunity for grad students and
early-career postdocs to present their research on lunar and small 
body science in a low-stress, friendly environment, being critiqued 
only by their peers. In addition to oral presentations, the conference 
presents opportunities for professional development and networking 
with fellow grad students and postdocs, as well as senior members of
SSERVI. A limited amount of funding will be provided for travel and 
lodging costs. The deadline for registration and abstract submission 
is June 5th 2015, 11:59 PM PDT.

Selected teams will be funded by contract and shall be responsible 
for the following tasks in support of the proposed scientific 
investigations with WFIRST:

- Development of scientific performance requirements;
- Design of observing program(s);
- Development of science data analysis techniques; and
- Development of simulations and data challenges to validate the 
  above items.

This amendment releases the draft text for community comment.

DPS MEMBER WILLIAM J. BORUCKI WINS 2015 SHAW PRIZE IN ASTRONOMY

Congratulations to DPS member William J. Borucki of NASA Ames Research
Center who was announced on Monday as the 2015 winner of the Shaw 
Prize in Astronomy for his conceiving and leading the Kepler mission, 
which greatly advanced knowledge of both extrasolar planetary systems 
and stellar interiors. When contacted, he said of winning the prize 
that "it has been a pleasure to see the science community use the 
Kepler results to produce a cornucopia of discoveries." 

The Shaw Prize 

http://www.shawprize.org/

has been called "The Asian Nobel", and has awarded prizes of 
$1,000,000 in Astronomy, Biology, and Mathematics since 2002. Present 
DPS members who have prevously won the Shaw Prize include Geoff Marcy 
in 2005 and Peter Goldreich in 2007.

GSA SESSION T177 - WHEN WATER MEETS ROCK: AQUEOUS ALTERATION IN THE 
SOLAR SYSTEM

We want to call your attention to a session at the GSA Annual Meeting 
on water-rock interactions.

On Earth reaction pathways of water-rock reactions can be observed 
directly, but elsewhere in the solar system we are often left with 
the mineralogical and geochemical products of these interactions to 
interpret the processes. On Mars, orbital and rover observations 
along with analyses of meteorites point to a rich history of 
water-rock interactions. Carbonaceous chondrites are typified by 
nearly complete alteration through the action of water. The Dawn 
and Rosetta missions are exploring solar system bodies that have 
been modified by water. For planetary aqueous environments, big
picture questions include: 
 
(1) whether observed aqueous minerals formed at the surface or in the 
    subsurface and under ambient or hydrothermal conditions and 
(2) the durations and volumes of liquid water involved. 

The goal is to explore how exciting new results from mineralogic and 
geochemical studies based on orbital and landed measurements integrate 
with field, laboratory, meteoritical, and modeling investigations 
that address aqueous processes on planetary bodies.

Abstracts are due August 11:
