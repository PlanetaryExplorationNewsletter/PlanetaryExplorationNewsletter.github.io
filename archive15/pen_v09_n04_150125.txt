ABSCICON SESSION I

Abstracts due March 4th

http://www.hou.usra.edu/meetings/abscicon2015/program/abstract_
submission/

Theme: How to Build a Habitable Planet
Session Topic: Beyond the Catastrophe: Impact Generated Environments 
and the Search for Life

Meteorite impacts create unique microbial niches that may have served 
as habitats on early Earth and are important astrobiological targets 
on other bodies such as Mars. Impact generated lithologies represent 
understudied habitats both for microbial colonization as well for the 
potential to preserve biological evidence. During the Late Heavy 
Bombardment (affecting the early inner Solar System), the impact flux 
on the inner planets was significantly higher. Intriguingly, the 
earliest evidence for life on Earth coincides with the end of LHB, 
thereby suggesting that impact events profoundly influenced the early 
evolution, if not origin, of life. Considering the ubiquity of impact 
events in the Solar System and the effect they have on the habitability 
of a planet, a better understanding of the biological potential of 
such environments has implications for current and future life-
detection missions. This session will explore the habitability of 
ancient and modern impact-generated substrates and environments, the 
possible effects on the origins and evolution of life, and the 
potential of such systems to preserve biosignatures.

ABSCICON SESSION II

Please join us for the session on “Determining the Origin and Nature 
of Prebiotic Species in Comets” at the upcoming AbSciCon meeting this 
summer, June 15-19 in Chicago, Illinois. This session invites 
contributions from comet observations at all wavelengths, 
investigating the inventory and origin of cometary organics. Abstract 
submission is now open (closes March 4), and details, as well as a 
list of other session topics, are available at the AbSciCon website:

http://www.hou.usra.edu/meetings/abscicon2015/

Theme: How to Build a Habitable Planet 
Session Title: Determining the Origin and Nature of Prebiotic Species 
in Comets

Summary: Sublimated molecular ice, silicate dust, and solid-state 
carbonaceous materials are the major components of cometary comae that 
can be studied by space- and ground-based observations, as well as by 
rendezvous missions. Multiple organic molecules are now routinely 
detected, including ethylene glycol and formamide, as well as a number 
of unidentified lines in bright comets that suggest that other 
organic/prebiotic molecules may be present and detectable in comets. 
This session invites contributions from comet observations at all 
wavelengths, investigating the inventory and origin of cometary 
organics.
 
Sincerely,
Stefanie Milam and Martin Cordiner

WORKSHOP ON THE POTENTIAL FOR FINDING LIFE IN A EUROPA PLUME

Wednesday, February 18, 2015
NASA ARC
Building 152
Moffett Field, California

Convened by the Planetary Science Division
NASA Headquarters
Washington, DC

Hosted by
NASA Astrobiology Institute (NAI)
Solar System Exploration Research Virtual Institute (SSERVI)

Current Europa missions under study by NASA are focused on answering 
the question “Is Europa habitable?” However, the potential presence
of water plumes on the satellite could present an opportunity to pursue 
the question “Is there life on Europa?” Answering this question is far 
more challenging because measurements currently possible may provide 
only ambiguous results from a mission that either orbits or flies by 
Europa at relatively high velocity. To that end, NASA’s Planetary 
Science Division is convening a workshop to consider strategies to 
investigate Europa’s putative plumes for evidence of life. 

Abstract Submission:
Abstracts should be submitted by 1/27/15 through the Lunar and 
Planetary Institute (LPI) website at:

https://www.hou.usra.edu/meeting_portal/abstract_submission/?mtg=516

Registration is free. All attendees, whether submitting an abstract or 
not, are requested to register at the following website:

https://astrobiology.nasa.gov/calendar/europa-plume-workshop/workshop-
europa-plume-registration/

The workshop will be followed on Feb. 19-20 by a meeting of the Outer 
Planets Assessment Group that will also be held at Ames.

JOB OPPORTUNITY: STSCI RESEARCH AND INSTRUMENT ANALYSTS

The Space Telescope Science Institute has openings for Research and
Instrument Analysts (RIA) in our Instruments Division. RIAs will
assist Instrument Scientists in the reduction and analysis of Hubble
Space Telescope calibration data. Analysts will also assist in the
development and testing of the scientific instruments and optical
systems for the James Webb Space Telescope. They will provide user
support to HST General Observers and Archival Researchers in various
aspects of observation planning and data reduction. Additionally,
analysts may become involved in cutting-edge astronomical research by
providing support for scientific programs of staff scientists. Such
support can involve calibrating data, photometry, spectroscopy, image
drizzling, coding, and laboratory work in astronomical
instrumentation.

Successful applicants typically have a Bachelor's, Master's or a
recent PhD degree in Astronomy, Physics, Astrophysics, Planetary
Science, or related fields. The starting position (RIA I, II, Senior)
and salary are commensurate with education and experience. Experience
with astronomical research, instrumentation or optics, scientific
computing, data analysis, and IRAF or other astronomical software
packages, is also desired. Additional mathematical, statistical, and
programming skills (e.g. IDL, python) are a plus.

Applications due: January 31, 2015

Planetary Systems: A Synergistic View
International Center for Interdisciplinary Science Education
Quy Nhon, Vietnam
19-25 July 2015

http://rencontresduvietnam.org/conferences/2015/planetary-systems/

Abstract Deadline: 20 February 2015

With exciting results coming from both exoplanet observations and 
solar system exploration missions, it sometimes seems that the two 
fields of “planetary studies” aren’t talking to each other. What new 
insights might come from a synergistic approach to planetary studies, 
where exoplanet observations and solar system scientists share data 
sets, develop and tune models jointly, and encourage postdoctoral 
fellowships and faculty positions that transcend the exoplanet solar 
system divide? 

With this announcement, we solicit abstracts for presentations/posters 
that focus on major new observational projects and what we expect to 
learn over the next decade. Jane Luu will present the keynote address, 
and presentations will be organized around these themes:

- Lessons from Solar Systems and Exoplanets
- Comparative Studies of Planet Formation
- Criteria for Habitability and Lessons from our Solar System
- Future Missions

Submit abstracts online at:

http://rencontresduvietnam.org/conferences/2015/planetary-systems/
abstracts/

Abstracts are limited to 300 words. Abstracts and those accepted for 
presentation must be in English. Only one abstract per presenting 
author is allowed. Abstract acceptance notification will be sent by 
7 March 2015.

Volcanism and tectonism are the dominant endogenic means by which 
planetary surfaces change. This book aims to encompass the broad range 
in character of volcanism, tectonism, faulting and associated 
interactions observed on planetary bodies across the inner solar 
system – a region that includes Mercury, Venus, Earth, the Moon, Mars 
and asteroids. The diversity and breadth of landforms produced by 
volcanic and tectonic processes is enormous, and varies across the 
inner solar system bodies. As a result, the selection of prevailing 
landforms and their underlying formational processes that are 
described and highlighted in this volume are but a primer to the 
expansive field of planetary volcanism and tectonism.
