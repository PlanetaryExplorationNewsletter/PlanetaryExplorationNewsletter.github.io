TENURE TRACK POSITION IN TECTONICS

The Department of Geological Sciences and Engineering at the 
University of Nevada, Reno seeks a Scientist for a tenure-track 
faculty position at the Assistant Professor level specializing in 
Tectonics and Deformation. We seek an outstanding scientist who 
explores tectonic processes using a combination of field, laboratory, 
and numerical techniques and, in doing so, will establish an 
innovative, world-class externally-funded research program. 
Applications are due by December 31, 2015 and review will begin 
shortly after. All interested applicants should view the application 
and submit their materials at:

POSITION TITLE: EXPERIMENTAL PLANETARY SCIENCES (EPS)

The California Institute of Technology (Caltech), Postdoctoral 
Scholars Program at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) invites 
applications for a postdoctoral research position in JPL's Ice 
Spectroscopy Laboratory (ISL).

The research will involve laboratory simulations to understand surface 
processes on icy bodies such as Europa and on Titan. Dr. Murthy 
Gudipati (Principal Scientist), in JPL's Planetary Sciences Section, 
will serve as JPL postdoctoral advisor to the selected candidate. 
Candidates should have a recent PhD in Physics, Chemistry, Planetary 
Science, or related scientific area with a strong background in 
advanced laboratory physical chemistry/chemical physics. Experience 
in planetary sciences, astrochemistry, and astrobiology is highly 
desirable. Candidates who have received their PhD within the past 
five years since the date of their application are eligible. 
This positions is for one-year and may be renewed up to a maximum 
of three years based on performance and availability of funds. 
Arrange for 2-3 letters of reference letters to be sent to:

Dr. Murthy Gudipati (+1-818-354-2637)
murthy.gudipati(at)jpl.nasa.gov

Caltech and JPL are equal opportunity/affirmative action employers. 
Women, minorities, veterans, and disabled persons are encouraged to 
apply.

SAVE-THE-DATE AND CALL FOR ABSTRACTS FOR THE SECOND INTERNATIONAL 
WORKSHOP ON MARTIAN GULLIES

"Martian Gullies and Their Earth Analogues"
20-21 June 2016, hosted by the Geological Society, Burlington House, 
 London, UK
#martiangullies

https://www.geolsoc.org.uk/martiangullies

Deadline for oral abstracts: Friday, 29 January 2016
We encourage both established Mars-researchers and those new to the 
field to attend and contribute. We particularly welcome abstracts 
concerning Earth analogues, and experimental, numerical modelling 
and, of course, remote sensing studies will all be considered.   
The workshop is focussed on gullies but can encompass contributions 
on associated landforms, such as recurring slope lineae (RSL), 
glacier-like forms, "solifluction" lobes, patterned ground, impact 
craters, dunes, etc, with the caveat that they impact on our 
understanding of gully-formation or modification. For more details 
on the conference, please see the website!

RADARSAT-2 GRADUATE STUDENT OPPORTUNITY, THE UNIVERSITY OF WESTERN 
ONTARIO

The Centre for Planetary Science and Exploration (CPSX) at the 
University of Western Ontario has an opening for a graduate student 
in the field of radar remote sensing starting in May 2016. The 
Canadian Space Agency funded work will combine remote sensing of the 
Canadian Arctic with field work to be conducted in Summer 2016. 
To apply to the Graduate Program in Planetary Science, prospective 
students must first apply to the graduate program in their department 
of interest and then specify planetary science.

AOGS2016 SESSION PS-08: SOLAR SYSTEM PRIMITIVE BODY EXPLORATION 
MISSIONS

Asia Oceania Geosciences Conference 2016
July 31 - Aug 5, Beijing, China

http://www.asiaoceania.org/aogs2016/public.asp?page=home.htm

This session welcomes abstracts about the results from all past and 
ongoing small body missions, by combining multiple missions, as well 
as new concepts for future missions. Solar system small bodies are 
considered the best-preserved fossils from the early era of planetary 
systems formation. Small body exploration missions have tremendously 
revolutionized our understanding of the formation of the planetary 
system with their paradigm changing results. In the context of past 
and current missions, such as Giotto, NEAR, Deep Impact, Stardust, 
EPOXI, Stardust-NExT, Hayabusa, Rosetta, and Dawn, as well as the 
potential future missions such as Hayabusa2, OSIRIS-REx, and 
potentially Lucy, Psyche, AIDA, and the Japanese Trojan asteroid 
mission, it is now the time to both combine the mission results to 
enhance scientific returns of these missions, and to help us develop 
concepts for future small body explorations.

Conveners:
Dr. Jian-Yang Li (Planetary Science Institute, United States)
Dr. Makoto Yoshikawa (JAXA, Japan)
Dr. Lucy McFadden (NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, United States)
Dr. Sebastien Besse (ESA, Spain)
Dr. Liang Chang (Yunnan Observatory, China)
