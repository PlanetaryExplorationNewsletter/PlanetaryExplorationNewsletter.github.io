AOGS2016 SESSION PS-09: PLANETARY SCIENCE DATA ARCHIVING

Asia Oceania Geosciences Conference 2016
July 31 – Aug 5, Beijing, China
 
http://www.asiaoceania.org/aogs2016/public.asp?page=home.htm
 
The focus of this session is planetary science data archives, 
archiving activities, and future plans. We will invite speakers from 
the major data archiving organizations from various space agencies to 
discuss their data archiving facilities and activities, and invite 
contributed abstracts related to all aspects of planetary science data 
archiving activities and concepts. It is of great importance and broad 
community interest to archive and make available to public the data 
returned by planetary science exploration missions, and related data 
from Earth-based observing facilities. The ultimate goal is to enable 
and facilitate combined scientific analyses using data covering long 
time-baselines and multiple observations for new phenomena and 
scientific objectives emerging in future times. This session provides 
a forum for researchers in planetary sciences to discuss and 
understand the standards, approaches, current progress, and future 
plans and concepts for effective long-term planetary science data 
preservation.
 
Conveners:
Dr. Jian-Yang Li (Planetary Science Institute, United States)
Dr. Ludmilla Kolokolova (University of Maryland, United States)
Dr. Daniel Crichton (JPL, Caltech, United States)
Dr. Sebastien Besse (ESA, Spain)
Dr. Yukio Yamamoto (JAXA, Japan)

INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON LUNAR AND PLANETARY SCIENCE 2016

International Symposium on Lunar and Planetary Science (ISLPS) is a 
bi-yearly conference series co-organized by China University of 
Geosciences (Wuhan) and Macau University of Science and Technology. 

The 2016 meeting will be held on June 9 and 10 in Wuhan, China. The 
Science Organization Committee is co-chaired by Prof. Wing-Huen Ip 
(NCU, Taiwan) and Prof. James Head (Brown University). This 
international symposium aims at the international academic exchange 
on the topics of processing, analysis, research and application of 
lunar and planetary exploration data. The scope of the symposium 
includes, but not limited to, lunar and planetary compositions, 
topography, surface and internal processes, geology, planetary 
atmosphere and magnetic fields and plasmas, meteorites and 
cosmochemistry, asteroids and comets, and future deep space missions.

For more information, go to:

Authors are invited to submit a full paper in the form of an 
electronic file in WORD format to zyxiao@cug.edu.cn before March 30, 
2016. A template is available. All accepted papers will be presented 
in the symposium, and a special issue in an English journal is under 
planning.

[NASA] PDS - LUNAR RECONNAISSANCE ORBITER DATA RELEASE 24

The NASA Planetary Data System is pleased to announce a new delivery 
of Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) data for the following 
instruments:

CRaTER
DLRE
LAMP
LEND
LOLA
LROC

In general, LRO Release 24 includes data collected between June 15, 
2015 and September 14, 2015.

To access the above data, please visit the following link:

http://pds.nasa.gov/tools/subscription_service/SS-20151215.shtml

PDS offers two services for searching the LRO archives:

The Planetary Image Atlas at the Imaging Node allows selection of LRO 
data by specific search criteria. 

http://pds-imaging.jpl.nasa.gov/search/

The Lunar Orbital Data Explorer at the Geosciences Node allows 
searching and downloading of LRO data and other lunar orbital data sets 
(Clementine and Lunar Prospector).

[NASA] PDS - MARS EXPLORATION ROVERS DATA RELEASE 46

The Planetary Data System (PDS) is pleased to announce Release 46
of Mars Exploration Rover data. This release includes data primarily
from Sols 3961 through 4050, rover Opportunity (MER1/B), instruments:
 
APXS
Atmospheric Opacity
HAZCAM
NAVCAM
MI
PANCAM
RAT
Rover Motion Counter
 
There is no RAT or Radio Science data in this release, no more
Mini-TES or Moessbauer data is expected, and SPICE data will be
available soon.

[NASA] CANCELLATION OF THE PARTICIPATING SCIENTIST PROGRAM FOR THE 
INSIGHT MISSION

ROSES-15 Amendment 38 announces the cancellation of the Participating 
Scientist Program (PSP) for the Interior Exploration using Seismic 
Investigations Geodesy and Heat Transport (InSight) Mission.
 
This amendment cancels the PSP due to the suspension of InSight’s 
March 2016 launch. Please see: 

http://www.nasa.gov/press-release/nasa-suspends-2016-launch-of-
insight-mission-to-mars-media-teleconference-today

NASA will evaluate the path forward for the InSight mission, and the 
re-issuance of this opportunity in a future ROSES solicitation will be 
part of that evaluation.
 
This Amendment is posted on the NASA research opportunity homepage at: 

http://nspires.nasaprs.com/ 

and will appear on the RSS feed at:

[NASA] HEOMD HAS RELEASED A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION

Advanced Exploration Systems of NASA’s HEOMD has released a RFI seeking 
information on payloads that could acquire data to help us better 
understand the nature of lunar volatiles. This RFI requests details for 
instruments that would fly in a lunar polar orbit to provide new 
knowledge on the location, amount, movement, and habitability of 
volatiles in sunlight, or in the permanently shadowed regions. Details 
can be found at:

CALL FOR A SPECIAL ISSUE IN PLANETARY AND SPACE SCIENCE

The Special Issue entitled "Solar Wind Interaction with the Terrestrial 
Planets" just published in Planetary and Space Science journal was a 
really successful experience with 13 contributing papers. We decided 
to propose again a Special Issue with same topic for 2016.

The covered topics will include all aspects of planetary plasma 
physics and interactions in the inner Solar System, e.g.,:

- Magnetospheres, ionospheres, auroras
- The solar wind interaction with planets (Mercury, Venus, Earth, 
  Mars) 
  and their moons, or with asteroids / comets
- Plasma interactions with exospheres, dust and surfaces
- Intercomparisons of planetary environments

Contributions are welcome which address previous, present, forthcoming 
and planned observations from space, as well as ground-based 
observations, theoretical modeling, simulations, and laboratory studies 
on planetary analogues to simulate surface-plasma interactions.

The deadline for submission will be the 1st of May 2016, leading to a 
publication in end of 2016.

Please indicate as soon as possible your interest in contributing to 
the special issue, together with a preliminary title of the intended 
paper. An approximate abstract, if available, would also be 
appreciated.
