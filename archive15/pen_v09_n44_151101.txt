2016 PIERAZZO INTERNATIONAL STUDENT TRAVEL AWARD

Application deadline: 9 PM PST, November 13, 2015

Awards will be announced on or before November 30, 2015

This award is established by the Planetary Science Institute in memory 
of Senior Scientist Betty Pierazzo to support and encourage graduate 
students to build international collaborations and relationships in 
planetary science. Two awards will be made each year, contingent upon 
there being meritorious applications. One will be awarded to a graduate 
student working on his or her Ph.D. at an institution within the U.S. 
This is to support travel to a planetary science related meeting 
(conferences and workshops) outside of the U.S. The second award will 
be to a graduate student working on his or her Ph.D. at an institution 
outside of the U.S. This is to support travel to a planetary science 
related meeting within the U.S. These include general meetings that 
have planetary-focused sessions such as the AGU, GSA, EGU and IAG.

The award will consist of a certificate and up to $2000US.

DPS MEETING WORKSHOP: CHARACTERIZING NEW HORIZONS KBO TARGETS FROM 
EARTH

Tuesday November 10th, 12:20pm - 1:30pm, Annapolis 3

This lunchtime workshop will discuss needs and opportunities for 
Earth-based KBO observations to support the potential New Horizons 
extended mission to the Kuiper Belt. At New Year 2019, subject to 
NASA approval of an extended mission, New Horizons will encounter the 
cold classical KBO 2014 MU69, providing the first ever close-up view 
of a small KBO. The spacecraft also has the opportunity to make 
unique long-range observations of about a dozen additional KBOs 
during its transit through the Kuiper Belt. Earth-based observations 
can help to maximize the science return from the Kuiper Belt mission 
by providing (for instance) astrometric, color, lightcurve, and 
photometric data on target KBOs, and by providing a broader context 
for the New Horizons targets. This workshop will outline the planned 
New Horizons KBO mission, and provide an opportunity for discussion 
of potential Earth-based support observations. All are welcome- 
if possible please contact John Spencer (spencer@boulder.swri.edu) 
if you expect to attend.

AIDA WORKSHOP AT THE DPS 2015 MEETING 

National Harbor
Lunch time on Monday, Nov. 9 (Room Annapolis 1)

The AIDA (Asteroid Impact & Deflection Assessment) mission will be 
the first demonstration of asteroid deflection by a spacecraft kinetic 
impact, currently in Phase A study. The target will be the binary 
asteroid Didymos in 2022 whose mutual orbit will be changed by the 
impact. An integral part of AIDA will be coordinated ground-based 
observing campaigns to detect and measure impact effects. The AIDA 
Workshop at DPS will be an open meeting. Please come if interested 
to join discussions of the parallel AIDA Phase A studies for ESA 
and NASA and to hear about opportunities to participate in AIDA 
Working Groups for observations, modeling and simulations.

NSF DEAR COLLEAGUE LETTER REGARDING ARECIBO OBSERVATORY

A notice for the planetary science community:

The continued operation of the Arecibo Observatory (AO) is now 
officially open to question. In the below 'Dear Colleague Letter', 
released this week, the National Science Foundation (NSF) clearly 
states its desire to defund AO further (we have already been operating 
under severe budget cuts for the past few years) and ultimately 
transfer ownership of and responsibility for the observatory to some 
other organization:

http://www.nsf.gov/pubs/2016/nsf16005/nsf16005.jsp?WT.mc_id=
USNSF_25&WT.mc_ev=click

It is important to note that this decision is much more driven by 
NSF funding squeezes and its commitment to new projects than it is a 
measure of the scientific performance of Arecibo Observatory -- which 
continues to be excellent. The William E. Gordon 305-m diameter radio 
telescope remains as the world's largest and most sensitive single-
dish antenna, and as such retains the potential for many more years 
of exceptional science (especially if upgraded further). The work that 
we do here is incredibly important, and we now need the help and 
support of the scientific community in order to continue it.

scientists and engineers to conduct research largely of their own 
choosing, yet compatible with the research opportunities posted on the 
NPP Web site.

Selected by a competitive peer-review process, NPP Fellows complete 
one- to three-year Fellowship appointments that advance NASA's 
missions in Earth science, heliophysics, astrophysics, planetary 
science, astrobiology, space bioscience, aeronautics and engineering, 
human exploration and operations, and space technology.

A sample research opportunities is:

https://apps.orau.gov/NPDoc/Catalog/18395

Applicants must have a Ph.D. or equivalent degree in hand before 
beginning the fellowship, but may apply while completing the degree
requirements. U. S. citizens, Lawful Permanent Residents, and foreign 
nationals eligible for J-1 status as a Research Scholar may apply.

Stipends start at $53,500 per year, with supplements for high cost-
of-living areas and for certain academic specialties. Financial 
assistance is available for relocation and health insurance, and 
$8,000 per year is provided for professional travel.
