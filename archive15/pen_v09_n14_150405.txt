CHARLES A. BARTH MEMORIAL SYMPOSIUM

May 15, 2015: 9:00 am-5:30pm at CU's Laboratory for Atmospheric and 
Space Physics (LASP), 3665 Discovery Drive, Boulder, CO

This symposium will include invited and contributed talks on topics 
to which Barth made significant contributions. Subjects include Earth 
and planetary atmospheres, UV spectroscopy, rocket studies, solar UV 
irradiance, nitric oxide, mission operations, student and PI-led 
missions. (Invited speakers: Scott Bailey, Phil Eberspeaker, 
Paul Feldman, Bill Possel, Gary Rottman, Kent Tobiska.) Given Barth's 
long commitment to education, we also solicit talks and posters from 
current students, former Barth students, and students of his former 
students. The symposium will close with a dinner and presentation 
of the first Barth Scholarship recipient.

NASA POSTDOCTORAL FELLOWSHIPS

The NASA Postdoctoral Program (NPP) provides opportunities for 
scientists and engineers to conduct research largely of their own 
choosing, yet compatible with the research opportunities posted on 
the NPP Web site.

Selected by a competitive peer-review process, NPP Fellows complete 
one- to three-year Fellowship appointments that advance NASA's missions 
in Earth science, heliophysics, astrophysics, planetary science, 
astrobiology, space bioscience, aeronautics and engineering, human 
exploration and operations, and space technology.

A sample research opportunity is:

https://www3.orau.gov/NPDoc/Catalog/18624

Applicants must have a Ph.D. or equivalent degree in hand before 
beginning the fellowship, but may apply while completing the degree
requirements. U. S. citizens, Lawful Permanent Residents, and 
foreign nationals eligible for J-1 status as a Research Scholar 
may apply.
 
Stipends start at $53,500 per year, with supplements for high cost-
of-living areas and for certain academic specialties. Financial 
assistance is available for relocation and health insurance, and 
$8,000 per year is provided for professional travel.

Applications are accepted three times each year: March 1, July 1, 
and November 1.

2015 NASA PLANETARY SCIENCE SUMMER SCHOOL APPLICATIONS OPEN

NASA is accepting applications from science and engineering post-docs, 
recent PhDs, and doctoral students for its 27th Annual Planetary 
Science Summer School, which will be held in one single session in 
summer 2015 (August 10-14 only) at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in 
Pasadena, Calif.  

During the program and pre-session webinars, student teams will carry 
out the equivalent of an early mission concept study, prepare a 
proposal authorization review presentation, present it to a review 
board, and receive feedback. By the end of the session, students will 
have a clearer understanding of the life cycle of a space mission; 
relationships between mission design, cost, and schedule; and the 
tradeoffs necessary to stay within cost and schedule while preserving 
the quality of science. 

Applications are due April 10, 2015. Partial financial support is 
available for a limited number of individuals. Further information 
is available at:

http://pscischool.jpl.nasa.gov

[NASA] CHANGE OF DUE DATE - K2 GUEST OBSERVER CYCLE 3

This amendment details the Campaign 9 Microlensing Science Team Call 
and changes the due dates for program element D.7 K2 Guest Observer 
Cycle 3. 

Step-1 proposals are due on June 2, 2015
Step-2 proposals are due on July 1, 2015

New text is in bold and deleted text is struck through.

Program element D.7 of ROSES-2015 solicits proposals for the 
acquisition and analysis of new scientific data from the K2 mission 
(http://keplerscience.arc.nasa.gov/K2). K2 repurposes the space-borne 
hardware and ground-based operations of the Kepler mission 
(http://keplerscience.arc.nasa.gov) for a pointed survey of 
predetermined locations along the ecliptic plane. The single, 
visible-wavelength instrument on board K2 provides high-precision 
photometry capability, with short cadence and long cadence modes 
(1 minute and 30 minute exposures), and provides a powerful tool 
for broadband variability analyses of planetary, stellar, 
extragalactic, and solar system sources.

ARCHIVE YOUR SMALL BODIES DATA IN PDS SMALL BODIES NODE

Are you a small bodies researcher with ground-based telescopic data 
or derived data that could benefit the community? Do you have lab 
data on characteristics of minerals or ices? Are you writing a 
proposal for a project which will result in archivable small bodies 
data? The Planetary Data System Small Bodies Node (SBN) invites you 
to submit your data for archiving.

Archiving your data in PDS is a valuable public service. It also 
meets the goals outlined in NASA's "Plan: Increasing Access to the 
Results of Scientific Research"

http://science.nasa.gov/media/medialibrary/2014/12/05/NASA_Plan_
for_increasing_access_to_results_of_federally_funded_research.pdf  

It makes your data available to current researchers as well as 
allowing it to be curated for the use of researchers many decades 
in the future. Data sets archived in SBN also receive a citation 
as a peer-reviewed publication which is listed in ADS and can be 
cited when researchers use your data.

The SBN (http://pdssbn.astro.umd.edu) is the node of PDS 
responsible for data on asteroids, comets, small planetary 
satellites, meteors, and dust, as well as laboratory spectra of 
ices, minerals, and meteorites.

For more information, for help in archive planning for a proposal, 
or to submit data, see:
