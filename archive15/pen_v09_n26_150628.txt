[NASA] NOTIFICATION OF AN INVITATION TO MEMBERSHIP ON THE FORMULATION 
ASSESSMENT AND SUPPORT TEAM (FAST) FOR THE ASTEROID REDIRECT MISSION

The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) intends to 
release a letter of invitation for membership on the Formulation 
Assessment and Support Team (FAST) for the Asteroid Redirect Mission 
(ARM). ARM is part of NASA's plan to advance the new technologies and 
spaceflight capabilities needed for a human mission to the Martian 
system in the 2030s, as well as other future human and robotic 
missions. ARM includes the Asteroid Redirect Robotic Mission (ARRM) 
and the Asteroid Redirect Crewed Mission (ARCM), along with leveraging 
the global asteroid-observation community's efforts to detect, track 
and characterize candidate asteroids. For additional information on 
how to apply for FAST membership, go to the NASA NSPIRES website at:

NASA POSTDOCTORAL FELLOWSHIPS

The NASA Postdoctoral Program (NPP) provides opportunities for 
scientists and engineers to conduct research largely of their own
choosing, yet compatible with the research opportunities posted on the 
NPP Web site.
 
Selected by a competitive peer-review process, NPP Fellows complete 
one- to three-year Fellowship appointments that advance NASA's missions 
in Earth science, heliophysics, astrophysics, planetary science, 
astrobiology, space bioscience, aeronautics and engineering, human 
exploration and operations, and space technology.

A sample opportunity is:

https://www3.orau.gov/NPDoc/Catalog/18395

Applicants must have a Ph.D. or equivalent degree in hand before 
beginning the fellowship, but may apply while completing the degree 
requirements. U. S. citizens, Lawful Permanent Residents, and foreign 
nationals eligible for J-1 status as a Research Scholar may apply.

Stipends start at $53,500 per year, with supplements for high cost-
of-living areas and for certain academic specialties. Financial 
assistance is available for relocation and health insurance, and 
$8,000 per year is provided for professional travel.

Applications are accepted three times each year: March 1, July 1, 
and November 1.

AGU SESSION P013 - JOVE YOU INSIDE OUT: GIANT PLANET INTERIORS, 
ATMOSPHERES, AURORAE, AND IONOSPHERES

We solicit new research findings about the magnetospheres, ionospheres, 
aurorae, neutral atmospheres and deep interiors of Jupiter, Saturn, 
Uranus, and Neptune. We especially encourage presentations about 
studies in anticipation of Juno's arrival at Jupiter, and the final 
phase of Cassini mission to Saturn, as both spacecraft will begin a 
critical phase of their missions in 2016; Juno will enter its orbit 
around Jupiter, and Cassini will go into the "Grand Finale" orbit 
which will take it inside the inner-most rings of Saturn. Other 
sources of data to be covered in our session include the continuing 
observation of Saturn by the Cassini spacecraft, and other recent 
space- and ground-based observation. We solicit results of long-term 
monitoring of all giant planets using ground- and space-based 
telescopes. We also encourage reports of recent activities at Uranus 
and Neptune. In addition, we solicit modeling and theoretical 
presentations that address these observational findings.

Deadline to submit an abstract: 5 August 2015, 11:59 P.M. EDT

NASA MARS LANDING SITE/EXPLORATION ZONE WORKSHOP

The First Landing Site/Exploration Zone Workshop for Human Missions to 
the Surface of Mars will be held October 27 to 30, 2015, at the Lunar 
Planetary Institute (LPI) in Houston, TX. The purpose of this workshop 
is to identify and discuss candidate locations where humans could land, 
live and work on the martian surface.

NASA hopes to engage scientists, technologists and experts in human 
exploration during the conference, fostering collaboration among the 
teams that will enable humans to explore Mars in the coming decades.

Potential "Exploration Zones" will need to offer compelling science 
research while also providing resources that our astronauts can take 
advantage of during their pioneering of the Red Planet. First 
explorers will be limited to about 60 miles (100 km) of travel from 
their landing site due to life support and exploration technology 
requirements.

G. K. GILBERT AWARD SESSION AT GSA 2015

The G. K. Gilbert award session at this year's GSA Annual Meeting, to 
take place in Baltimore, MD, Nov 1-4, is on the topic of "Understanding 
Mars' geology, from orbiter to rover-based exploration." This year's 
G. K. Gilbert awardee is Dr. Matt Golombek, from the Jet Propulsion 
Laboratory. The session is focused on the expanded view of Martian 
surface geology afforded by mobile robotic platforms, including the 
Mars Pathfinder, Mars Exploration Rovers, and the Mars Science 
Laboratory missions.
 
The GSA website is open until August 11 for abstract submissions, and 
abstracts are welcome for the G. K. Gilbert session. To submit to this 
session, please submit abstracts to the discipline pool and email the 
session co-chairs (Debra Buczkowski and Devon Burr) to let us know of 
your desire to present in the Gilbert session.
 
We look forward to seeing you in Baltimore in November!
