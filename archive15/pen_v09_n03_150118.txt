STUDENT SUMMER INTERNSHIPS AT APL

The Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory (APL) is 
offering summer projects for students interested in working on NASA 
missions or space-related research opportunities at APL. Details are 
available at:

http://aplnasaintern.jhuapl.edu

The application deadline is February 28, 2015.

CALL FOR WHITE PAPERS: HUBBLE SPACE TELESCOPE SCIENTIFIC LEGACY 
INITIATIVES

The Space Telescope Science Institute (STScI) has issued a call to the 
community for white papers describing initiatives that will 
significantly enhance Hubble's scientific legacy from the next 5 years 
of observations. Given the proximity of the original white paper 
deadline to the NASA Discovery Program deadline, STScI has revised the 
due date for white papers to March 4, 2015. Planetary science has been 
an important component of the Hubble program for 25 years, and we 
expect this will continue to be the case in Hubble's remaining years. 
We welcome the planetary community's thoughts on Hubble's future use.  
The call can be found at:

[NASA] OPAG MEETING

The next OPAG meeting will be February 19-20 at NASA Ames Research 
Center. Please go to the registration site posted at: 

http://www.lpi.usra.edu/opag/ 

and register for the meeting. Foreign nationals will need to do some 
extra paperwork, described at the registration site. The deadline for 
foreign nationals to register is January 23.

One day prior to the OPAG meeting a "Workshop on the Potential for 
Finding Life in a Europa Plume" will take place at NASA Ames Research 
Center. Please go to this website for more details:  

https://astrobiology.nasa.gov/calendar/europa-plume-workshop/

If you are a Discovery PI for an outer planet mission and would like 
to present a short overview of your mission concept at either this 
upcoming OPAG meeting in February or the subsequent OPAG meeting we 
would be happy to include you on the agenda. This is entirely 
voluntary. Please contact Candy Hansen at cjhansen@psi.edu if you are 
interested.

JOVIAN MAGNETIC FIELD AND MAGNETOSPHERE POSTDOCTORAL RESEARCHER

(NASA-GSFC/CRESST/University of Maryland)

Applications are now being accepted for a Postdoctoral Research 
Associate, funded through the University of Maryland College Park

Laboratory of the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) in the area 
of Jupiter's magnetic field and magnetosphere, using data from the Juno 
(New Frontier) mission. Additional details are available at: 

http://www.astro.umd.edu/employment/index.html#Juno

Candidates for this position should have a Ph.D. in a relevant 
scientific discipline with prior experience conducting scientific 
research. Experience with magnetometer instrumentation and data, 
disciplined programming skills (primarily Fortran and IDL), and 
scientific writing experience are desired.

The University of Maryland is an Affirmative Action, Equal Opportunity
Employer. Women and minorities are encouraged to apply. Applications 
will be accepted on an ongoing basis until the position is filled.

INVITATION TO PRESENT AT JAPANESE GEOSCIENCE UNION (JPGU)

May 24-28, 2015.
Chiba (near Tokyo), Japan 

Session: "Outer Solar System Exploration Today, and Tomorrow "

The giant planets provide many keys to understanding planetary 
processes. They play an important role in shaping our solar system, and 
the physical and chemical processes they harbor also provide a unique 
opportunity to study the phenomena relevant for studying Earth and 
other planets, including exoplanetary systems. In this session, we 
discuss a wide range of topics encompassing the giant planets and their 
moons, including their origins, interiors, atmospheres, compositions, 
surface features, and electromagnetic fields. To advocate for current 
and future outer planets exploration (Cassini, Juno, New Horizons, 
JUICE, and beyond), we also call for discussions on future missions to 
explore giant planet systems, including how to develop better 
international cooperation. Discussion will include progress in 
developing a solar sail mission concept for observing the Jupiter 
system and its trojan asteroids.

NASA POSTDOCTORAL FELLOWSHIPS

The NASA Postdoctoral Program (NPP) provides opportunities for 
scientists and engineers to conduct research largely of their own 
choosing, yet compatible with the research opportunities posted on 
the NPP Web site.

Selected by a competitive peer-review process, NPP Fellows complete 
one- to three-year Fellowship appointments that advance NASA's missions 
in Earth science, heliophysics, astrophysics, planetary science, 
astrobiology, space bioscience, aeronautics and engineering, human 
exploration and operations, and space technology.

An example of one of the research opportunities in planetary science 
is:

https://www3.orau.gov/NPDoc/Catalog/17565    

Applicants must have a Ph.D. or equivalent degree in hand before 
beginning the fellowship, but may apply while completing the degree 
requirements. U.S. citizens, Lawful Permanent Residents, and foreign 
nationals eligible for J-1 status as a Research Scholar may apply.

Stipends start at $53,500 per year, with supplements for high 
cost-of-living areas and for certain academic specialties. Financial 
assistance is available for relocation and health insurance, and 
$8,000 per year is provided for professional travel.

Applications are accepted three times each year: March 1, July 1, 
and November 1.
