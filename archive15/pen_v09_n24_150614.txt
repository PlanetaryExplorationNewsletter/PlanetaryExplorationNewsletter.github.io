FROM INTERSTELLAR ICES TO POLYCYCLIC AROMATIC HYDROCARBONS: A SYMPOSIUM 
TO HONOR LOU ALLAMANDOLA'S CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE MOLECULAR UNIVERSE

September 13-17, 2015
Annapolis, Maryland

Abstract deadline: June 26, 2015

Meeting and registration information is at: 

http://ices2pahs.strw.leidenuniv.nl

Extensive advances in the field of Astrochemistry have been made thanks 
to simultaneous efforts in astronomical infrared spectroscopy and to 
dedicated laboratory simulations and theoretical studies aimed at 
reproducing observed spectra throughout the interstellar medium.  
The molecular complexity, both organic and mineral, found in 
inter/proto-stellar and solar system environments have been attributed 
to primarily grain-surface and bulk chemistry reactions. 

This symposium will be composed of contributions from participants 
working on dedicated laboratory experiments, theoretical calculations 
of basic processes and chemical reaction networks, as well as 
astronomical observations of complex molecules and, more generally 
solid state materials in space. 

The scientific topics of this meeting include:

- Ices: Spectroscopy, Energetic Processing
- Surface Chemistry
- PAHs in Ices
- Identification, Observation, and Models of PAHs
- Formation of Complex Species in Ices: Astrobiology

APPLICATION DEADLINE FOR NAI DIRECTOR EXTENDED TO JULY 10, 2015

NASA seeks a new Director for the NASA Astrobiology Institute (NAI).  
The ideal candidate will be an internationally recognized scientist 
with proven experience in leading or managing large interdisciplinary 
research programs or projects, possessed with a vision for leading the 
Institute into the future. Applicants for this position should have a 
broad scientific perspective on astrobiology, experience in conducting 
interdisciplinary scientific research, and demonstrated skills needed to 
harness the strengths of disparate research communities towards a 
greater goal. S/he should understand how to grow a research endeavor 
and respond to changing budget climates while focusing on maximizing the 
scientific return on NASA's investments in astrobiology. S/he should 
have experience in leading a diverse staff ranging from established 
scientists to support personnel, resource planning, and executing 
budgets and schedules. S/he should be comfortable with modern 
information technologies and distributed research teams. NASA is 
particularly interested in applicants who will find ways to infuse 
astrobiology into NASA flight missions.

Interested individuals should apply at:

K2 SCIENCE CONFERENCE (K2SCICON)

Save the date for the K2 Science Conference (K2SCICON):

November 2-5, 2015

The LCOGT invites the whole astronomical community to celebrate the 
science from the first year of the K2 mission in sunny Santa Barbara!

All K2 users are welcome to present early scientific results from all 
areas of research, from our own Solar System and exoplanets to young 
stars and distant galaxies. We will hear updates on the mission and 
discuss the latest in data processing techniques. We also encourage 
contributions on results from the Kepler prime mission and the future 
TESS mission. 

Check the conference website in the coming weeks for updates and 
registration:

ESA RESEARCH FELLOWSHIP IN SPACE SCIENCE

Applications are now solicited for fellowships in space science to 
begin in the fall of 2016. Preference will be given to applications 
submitted by candidates within five years of receiving their PhD. 
Candidates not holding a PhD yet are encouraged to apply, but they 
must provide evidence of receiving their degree before starting the 
fellowship.

The deadline for applications is 1 October 2015.

More information on the ESA Research Fellowship programme in Space 
Science, on the conditions and eligibility, as well as the application 
form can be retrieved from:

NASA POSTDOCTORAL FELLOWSHIPS

The NASA Postdoctoral Program (NPP) provides opportunities for 
scientists and engineers to conduct research largely of their own 
choosing, yet compatible with the research opportunities posted on 
the NPP Web site.

Selected by a competitive peer-review process, NPP Fellows complete 
one- to three-year Fellowship appointments that advance NASA's 
missions in Earth science, heliophysics, astrophysics, planetary 
science, astrobiology, space bioscience, aeronautics and engineering, 
human exploration and operations, and space technology.

An example of one of the research opportunities in planetary science 
is:

https://www3.orau.gov/NPDoc/Catalog/18696  

Applicants must have a Ph.D. or equivalent degree in hand before 
beginning the fellowship, but may apply while completing the degree 
requirements. U. S. citizens, Lawful Permanent Residents, and foreign 
nationals eligible for J-1 status as a Research Scholar may apply.

Stipends start at $53,500 per year, with supplements for high 
cost-of-living areas and for certain academic specialties. Financial 
assistance is available for relocation and health insurance, and 
$8,000 per year is provided for professional travel.

Applications are accepted three times each year: March 1, July 1, and 
November 1.

FALL AGU SESSION: MAGMA CHANNELIZATION ACROSS THE SOLAR SYSTEM

Please consider proposing to this session at the Fall AGU Meeting:

Session ID: 8936
Session Title: Magma Channelization Across the Solar System

Convenors:  David A. Williams (Arizona State University), Christopher 
Hamilton (University of Arizona), C. Michael Lesher (Laurentian 
University)

Summary: Understanding magma emplacement mechanisms are important in 
volcanology, planetary science, and economic geology. On Earth, much 
work is being done to understand better how magma emplacement is 
focused in channels, tubes, and conduits, and the relative roles of 
construction vs. thermo-mechanical erosion in their formation. On 
Earth, it is clear that most magmatic Ni-Cu-PGE deposits and some Cr 
deposits occur in lava channels and magma conduits, so they also have
important economic implications. And across the Solar System, new 
data from NASA missions continues to reveal more detailed morphological 
and compositional information about extraterrestrial lava flows. We 
propose this session to bring together terrestrial and planetary 
volcanologists and economic geologists to review the latest results 
from our various studies, and to identify topics that would benefit 
from future collaboration and joint research.

The abstract submission site is now open. Please submit your abstracts 
by Wednesday, 5 August 23:59 EDT/03:59 +1 GMT.
