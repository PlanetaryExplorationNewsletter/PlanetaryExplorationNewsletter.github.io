IN MEMORIAM: B. RAY HAWKE (1946-2015)

From the Solar System Exploration Virtual Research Institute:

It is with great sadness that we announce the death of 
Dr. B. Ray Hawke. He died Saturday evening, January 24th, 
at Straub Hospital.

(Excerpted from P. Spudis) "The study of telescopic spectra, involving 
very precise measurements of color at high resolution of very small 
spots on the Moon, became B. Ray's specialty. These spectra would be 
taken of many carefully selected geological targets, a great 
improvement over the previous approach of targeting mostly by 
geographic region. ...  His spectra were collected to address many 
scientific problems, including basin rings, dark halo craters, lunar 
"red spots" (spectrally anomalous regions), impact melt deposits and 
the ejecta of large craters and basins. B. Ray brought to these studies 
his extensive background in image analysis and interpretation. He had 
made geological maps of portions of the Moon, which for the first time 
could be interpreted in terms of mineral and chemical content. These 
studies are critical to our understanding of the complex and protracted 
geological evolution of the lunar crust."

POSTDOCTORAL SCIENTIST: PLANETARY CLIMATE MODELING

Columbia University: 2-year Postdoctoral Research Scientist appointment 
to model radiative processes and their effect on planetary climates in 
a general circulation model.

The successful candidate will join an interdisciplinary team from the 
Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS), GSFC, Columbia University, 
and other institutions. Team research addresses the habitability of 
past Solar System climates and exoplanet climates and informs the 
design of future exoplanet missions. The candidate will be expected to 
perform original research, present results at scientific meetings, and 
publish first-author peer-reviewed papers. The candidate will be 
resident at NASA GISS in New York City.

Requirements:  PhD. in atmospheric science, planetary science, 
astrobiology, astronomy, physics, or a similar field. Expertise in 
radiative transfer and willingness to become involved in radiation 
parameterization development are required, but the broad scope allows 
for many possible research directions using the model. Strong 
mathematics and programming skills are also required. Strong candidates 
will be interested in interdisciplinary questions and interacting with 
scientists from diverse fields. For further information visit: 

http://www.giss.nasa.gov/projects/astrobio/ 

or contact Anthony DelGenio (anthony.d.delgenio@nasa.gov). 

Columbia University is an Equal Opportunity/Affirmative Action 
employer.  Applications will be accepted until the position is filled.

NASA POSTDOCTORAL FELLOWSHIPS

The NASA Postdoctoral Program (NPP) provides opportunities for 
scientists and engineers to conduct research largely of their own 
choosing, yet compatible with the research opportunities posted on the 
NPP Web site.

Selected by a competitive peer-review process, NPP Fellows complete 
one- to three-year Fellowship appointments that advance NASA's missions 
in Earth science, heliophysics, astrophysics, planetary science, 
astrobiology, space bioscience, aeronautics and engineering, human 
exploration and operations, and space technology.

An example of one of the research opportunities in planetary science 
is:

MEPAG GOALS DOCUMENT UPDATE - FEEDBACK REQUESTED

As you may be aware, forward planning for the Mars Exploration Program 
is guided in large part by the MEPAG Goals Document, a living document 
which prioritizes scientific investigations within major areas of 
scientific knowledge (Life, Climate, Geology, and Preparation for 
Human Exploration). 

The MEPAG Goals Committee has updated the Goals Document to reflect 
the current state of knowledge. 

Although there are some portions of the document that are still 
undergoing active revision, the committee is soliciting your feedback 
on the current draft (2015 Review Version): 

http://mepag.nasa.gov/reports.cfm?expand=science

in advance of the discussion that will take place at the MEPAG 
face-to-face meeting in Pasadena later this month. Two files are posted 
- the main document (MEPAG%20Goals_Document_2015_v5.pdf) and a 
supplementary high-level summary (CombinedGoals_Feb4.pdf).

Please send your feedback to mepagmeetingqs@jpl.nasa.gov by

NEW POSTDOCTORAL RESEARCH OPPORTUNITY: LUNAR AND ASTEROID VOLCANIC 
STUDIES BASED ON TERRESTRIAL FIELDWORK, LABORATORY ANALYSIS, AND 
NUMERICAL MODELING

This NPP (NASA Postdoctoral Program) position provides an opportunity 
to work with the FINESSE (Field Investigations to Enable Solar System 
Science and Exploration) team based at NASA Ames Research Center as a
part of NASA's SSERVI (Solar System Exploration Research Virtual 
Institute). The FINESSE team focuses on a science and exploration 
field-based research program aimed at generating strategic knowledge in 
preparation for the human and robotic exploration of the Moon, 
near-Earth asteroids (NEAs) and Phobos & Deimos. We infuse our science 
program with leading edge exploration concepts since "science enables 
exploration and exploration enables science."

This NPP position will focus on terrestrial volcanic field studies, 
laboratory analysis of samples, and numerical modeling as analogs for 
lunar and asteroid volcanic systems. The candidate will study the 
processes, geomorphic features and rock types related to fissure 
eruptions, volcanic constructs, lava tubes, flows and pyroclastic 
deposits.

ABSCICON 2015: HABITABLE WORLDS IN OUR SOLAR SYSTEM

Session: The Habitability of Icy Worlds

This session will be a follow-on to the workshop by the same name, 
held in Pasadena in February 2014. The primary objective is similar 
and will focus on the astrobiological potential of icy worlds in the 
outer solar system - including Europa, Ganymede, Enceladus, Titan, and 
beyond - with discussion on future research directions and spacecraft 
missions that can best assess that potential given the unique planetary 
environments of the outer solar system. Comparative planetology 
presentations are encouraged as well as research involving terrestrial 
analogs. Topics covered include (but are not necessarily limited to) 
water and exotic solvents, chemical energy for life, organics and their 
detection, ocean physics and chemistry, icy world activity and 
habitability over time, and continuing and future outer solar system 
exploration.

The AbSciCon abstract deadline is March 4. Additional details and a 
list of other session topics, are available at the AbSciCon website:
