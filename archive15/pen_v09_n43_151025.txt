2016 PIERAZZO INTERNATIONAL STUDENT TRAVEL AWARD

Application deadline: 9 PM PST, November 13, 2015

Awards will be announced on or before November 30, 2015

This award is established by the Planetary Science Institute in memory 
of Senior Scientist Betty Pierazzo to support and encourage graduate 
students to build international collaborations and relationships in 
planetary science. Two awards will be made each year, contingent upon 
there being meritorious applications. One will be awarded to a graduate 
student working on his or her Ph.D. at an institution within the U.S. 
This is to support travel to a planetary science related meeting 
(conferences and workshops) outside of the U.S. The second award will 
be to a graduate student working on his or her Ph.D. at an institution 
outside of the U.S. This is to support travel to a planetary science 
related meeting within the U.S. These include general meetings that 
have planetary-focused sessions such as the AGU, GSA, EGU and IAG.

The award will consist of a certificate and up to $2000US.

THE 4TH ELSI SYMPOSIUM IN TOKYO, JAPAN

Three Experiments in Biological Origins: Early Earth, Venus and Mars
January 12 - January 16, 2016
Kuramae Hall, Tokyo Institute of Technology, Tokyo, Japan

Only Earth has generated and maintained a biosphere, which greatly
altered the chemical and physical evolution of the planet. Whether
Venus and Mars were temporarily able to develop a biosphere of any 
kind, is largely unknown.

Substantial progress has been made in forming a coherent picture of 
the early Solar System and planetary formation processes and our
understanding of the environmental conditions on young planets.
Investigation of initial sets of prebiotic chemical systems has
illuminated the origin and early evolution of life. Now all this
knowledge will coalesce around the concept of the planetary requisite
for prebiotic chemical evolution and origination of life.

To crystallize this knowledge is the goal of this symposium. We
summarize the formation and early environment of Venus, Earth and 
Mars and place them into context relative to each other, and to 
exoplanets. Why did just Earth succeed?

POSTDOCTORAL FELLOWSHIP IN EXOPLANETARY SCIENCE AT UC SANTA CRUZ

The Department of Astronomy and Astrophysics at the University of 
California, Santa Cruz (UCSC) invites applications for the position of 
Morrison Postdoctoral Fellow in Astronomy. For this year's Morrison 
Fellowship we are specifically targeting exoplanetary science.

UCSC is the home of the University of California Observatories (UCO), 
with facilities including the Lick and Keck Observatories and Thirty 
Meter Telescope (TMT) International Observatory. It is also one of the 
world's leading centers for research in computational astrophysics. 
The 3000-core Hyades cluster is the on-campus centerpiece of UCSC 
computational astrophysics. Close collaborations exist between 
Astronomy & Astrophysics, Physics, Earth & Planetary Sciences, and 
Applied Mathematics & Statistics.

Applicants should be able to contribute to the Department of Astronomy 
and Astrophysics in exoplanetary science investigations that are 
either observational or theoretical in nature.

Full job ad and additional information:

http://apo.ucsc.edu/academic_employment/jobs/PS-ASTRO-MF.pdf

Review of applications will begin on December 07, 2015.

Inquiries: 

Please contact Professor Jonathan Fortney at AstroRecruit@ucsc.edu.

NEXT OPAG MEETING

The next OPAG meeting will be February 1-2, 2016, at SWRI in San 
Antonio, TX.  Since the OPAG meeting is now considered a conference, 
JPLers will need to forecast by the end of October, and others by the 
end of November.

Keep an eye on the OPAG homepage - the draft agenda will be posted 
soon:

http://www.lpi.usra.edu/opag/

We will include a technology poster session again - please contact 
Pat Beauchamp (patricia.m.beauchamp@jpl.nasa.gov) if you would like to 
be included.

CALL FOR SPECIAL ISSUE IN PLANETARY AND SPACE SCIENCE (2016) 

We invite you to publish your results in a second edition of the 
Planetary and Space Science special issue entitled "Solar Wind 
Interaction with the Terrestrial Planets.”

Covered topics will include all aspects of planetary plasma physics 
and interactions in the inner Solar System, e.g.:

(a) magnetospheres, ionospheres, auroras
(b) the solar wind interaction with planets (Mercury, Venus, Earth, 
    Mars) and their moons, or with asteroids / comets
(c) plasma interactions with exospheres, dust and surfaces
(d) intercomparisons of planetary environments

Contributions are welcome that address previous, present, 
forthcoming and planned observations from space, and ground-based
observations, theoretical modeling or simulations. Laboratory 
studies on planetary analogues aiming to simulate the surface-plasma 
interaction will be considered as well.

The deadline for submission will be May 1, 2016. Regular papers are 
expected, and the usual refereeing process will be applied. Please 
inform us if a shifted deadline would be more convenient for you.

Please indicate your interest in contributing to the special issue, 
with a preliminary title of the intended paper, by October 30. An 
approximate abstract, if available, is appreciated.

Best regards,
A. Milillo, P. Garnier, A. Radioti, N. Ganushkina

ICE GIANTS WORKSHOP AT THE DPS MEETING IN NATIONAL HARBOR, MARYLAND

A workshop on the latest Ice Giant planet news and mission study 
efforts will be held at the DPS meeting on Thurs. Nov 12 at 12 pm. In 
this workshop we will discuss latest science results, outstanding 
questions, and ties to other bodies, such as exoplanets and the giant 
planets. We will also discuss coordinating activities, such as needed 
ground and space based observations of Uranus and Neptune that can aid 
future mission studies. These will be moderated discussions. 

Projection equipment will be available, but we are not requesting 
formal presentations.
