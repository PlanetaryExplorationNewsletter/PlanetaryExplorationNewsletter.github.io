NASA POSTDOCTORAL FELLOWSHIPS

The NASA Postdoctoral Program (NPP) provides opportunities for 
scientists and engineers to conduct research largely of their own 
choosing, yet compatible with the research opportunities posted on 
the NPP Web site.

Selected by a competitive peer-review process, NPP Fellows complete 
one- to three-year Fellowship appointments that advance NASA's missions 
in Earth science, heliophysics, astrophysics, planetary science, 
astrobiology, space bioscience, aeronautics and engineering, human 
exploration and operations, and space technology.

A sample opportunity is: 

https://www3.orau.gov/NPDoc/Catalog/17688  

Applicants must have a Ph.D. or equivalent degree in hand before 
beginning the fellowship, but may apply while completing the degree 
requirements. U. S. citizens, Lawful Permanent Residents, and foreign 
nationals eligible for J-1 status as a Research Scholar may apply.

Stipends start at $53,500 per year, with supplements for high 
cost-of-living areas and for certain academic specialties. Financial 
assistance is available for relocation and health insurance, and 
$8,000 per year is provided for professional travel.

Applications are accepted three times each year: March 1, July 1,
and November 1.

[NASA] ROSES-15 MAJOR CHANGES TO THE FINAL YEAR OF THE CASSINI 
PARTICIPATING SCIENTIST PROGRAM

The final text for ROSES-2015 Program Element C.10 The Cassini Data 
Analysis and Participating Scientists (CDAPS) Program has been posted. 
The solicitation has been restructured and the prior version has been 
replaced in its entirety.

The major changes are:

1) The Participating Scientist proposal is now separate from a parent 
Data Analysis proposal. Step-2 Participating Scientist submissions 
now require their own fifteen-page proposal that is accompanied by a 
five-page appendix on the Relevance to the Cassini Participating 
Scientist Program. 

2) Only those Participating Scientist proposals that demonstrate 
the need for future mission data for achieving successful closure 
of the scientific objectives are eligible for selection. 

The proposal due dates remain unchanged. 
Step-1 proposals are still due by June 1, 2015.
Step-2 proposals are due by August 18, 2015.

All potential proposers are strongly urged to carefully read the 
entire amended call, the Frequently Asked Questions, and all 
other supporting documentation. These documents may be found on 
the NSPIRES web page for ROSES-2015 Program Element C.10 CDAPS at:

CALL FOR ABSTRACTS: COMMERCIAL MISSIONS BEYOND EARTH ORBIT

Session MT4 at EPSC 2015
Abstracts are due 29 April 2015, 13:00 CET

Building on last year's session on the commercial exploration of
asteroids & comets, this session shall encourage discussions of any type
of commercial activity on or around asteroids, comets, moons and
planets. Recent activities ranging from a past Lunar flyby over asteroid
resource prospecting missions, which are currently under development, to
related emerging business models enable new ways of pursuing planetary
sciences.
