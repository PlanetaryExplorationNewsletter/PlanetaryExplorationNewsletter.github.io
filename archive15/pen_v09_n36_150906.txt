LOWELL OBSERVATORY: TENURE-TRACK OR TENURED ASTRONOMER

Lowell Observatory invites applications for one or more tenure-track
or tenured research positions in astronomy or planetary science. We
invite applicants at any career level who can build on current 
strengths or open new areas for Lowell. A Ph.D. in astronomy, planetary 
science, or a related field is required, as is an outstanding record of 
research and demonstrated ability or potential to obtain external 
research funding. Candidates are invited to describe how they would 
make use of our observational facilities, but we will give equal
consideration to all research areas. The start date for this position
is flexible but desired by Fall 2016.

Additional position details can be found at:

https://lowell.edu/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Tenure-track-
Astronomer.pdf

To apply, send applications electronically to:

humanresources@lowell.edu

Applications should include:
(1) a cover letter and CV,
(2) a research plan of 3 pages or less, and
(3) names and mail/email addresses of three individuals who have
agreed to serve as references. Do not ask for reference letters
to be sent in advance.

Applications must be received by November 1, 2015 for full
consideration.

Lowell Observatory is an Equal Employment Opportunity/Affirmative 
Action employer.

THEMIS GEODETICALLY CONTROLLED MOSAICS AVAILABLE FROM THE USGS

THEMIS infrared geodetically controlled mosaics, updated spacecraft 
pointing and orientation information (i.e., preliminary smithed 
SPICE kernels), and supporting documentation are available for download 
and public use from the United States Geological Survey (USGS) 
Astrogeology Science Center. Seventeen daytime infrared and fourteen 
nighttime infrared mosaics are currently available, with additional 
mosaics being released each January and July until a global product is 
completed. These mosaics are tied to a known coordinate system (USGS 
Viking Orbiter Mars Digital Image Model 2.1), spatially adjusted to 
align feature boundaries, and orthoprojected at 100 m/pixel scale. This 
process results in sub-pixel registration between images and the 
daytime IR and nighttime IR mosaics to be well-registered to one 
another. These products enhance our knowledge (e.g., position, 
precision, and accuracy) of image placement and the location of 
small-scale surface features, and will benefit the current and future 
orbital acquisition of data, the planning of spacecraft and surface 
operations, and allows for easier and improved intercomparison of all 
Mars data sets.

Please see the following website for product download and additional 
documentation:

-preliminary-smithed-kernels

NASA POSTDOCTORAL FELLOWSHIPS

The NASA Postdoctoral Program (NPP) provides opportunities for 
scientists and engineers to conduct research largely of their own 
choosing, yet compatible with the research opportunities posted on the 
NPP Web site.

Selected by a competitive peer-review process, NPP Fellows complete 
one- to three-year Fellowship appointments that advance NASA's missions 
in Earth science, heliophysics, astrophysics, planetary science, 
astrobiology, space bioscience, aeronautics and engineering, human 
exploration and operations, and space technology.

An example of one of the research opportunities in planetary science 
is:

https://apps.orau.gov/NPDoc/Catalog/18715

Applicants must have a Ph.D. or equivalent degree in hand before 
beginning the fellowship, but may apply while completing the degree 
requirements. U. S. citizens, Lawful Permanent Residents, and foreign 
nationals eligible for J-1 status as a Research Scholar may apply.

Stipends start at $53,500 per year, with supplements for high 
cost-of-living areas and for certain academic specialties. Financial 
assistance is available for relocation and health insurance, and 
$8,000 per year is provided for professional travel.

Applications are accepted three times each year: March 1, July 1, and 
November 1.

characterization for the Mars 2020 rover mission. The intent is to 
convert mission data and numerical simulations into products focused 
on specific landing site targets (to be provided by the program) that 
will be useful for reducing the risk to the Mars 2020 rover mission. 

Details of this RFP are posted at:

https://acquisition.jpl.nasa.gov/rfp/NT-2692-081715/default.htm

or 

https://acquisition.jpl.nasa.gov/bizops/

The first CCTP meeting, held in 2012, fostered a series of 
interdisciplinary conversations on a wide range of planetary climates. 
We are planning for a similar range of conversations at the CCTP2 
meeting, including the effects of the Sun and other stars on the 
climates of Earth and other planets in and beyond the Solar System. We 
encourage you to listen to the conversations we foster at CCTP-2, and 
to extend them via the Adobe Connect chat room. This meeting is 
supported by NASA's Science Mission Directorate (SMD). For more
