MAVEN DATA USERS' WORKSHOP AND PROJECT SCIENCE GROUP MEETING

The first MAVEN data is scheduled to be released via the PDS in 
May 2015. We will hold a one-day data users' workshop during the week 
of 22 June to help new users learn how to access, utilize, and 
understand the data. In addition, we want to invite scientists who are 
using MAVEN data to interact with the MAVEN science team at our 
Project Science Group meeting that same week. Both meetings will be 
held at LASP in Boulder, Colorado. Specific days that week are still 
being worked out. The data workshop is open to anybody who wishes to 
attend. Participation in the PSG is open only to researchers who are 
actively using MAVEN data. No funding is available to attend either 
meeting.

To express interest in the data users' workshop, or to apply to 
participate in the PSG, please email bruce.jakosky@lasp.colorado.edu. 
Participation must be approved in advance, and we cannot accept walk-up 
participants.

TRAVEL GRANT ANNOUNCEMENT

The Gerald A. Soffen Memorial Fund is pleased to announce the first 
2015 Travel Grant application opportunity for undergraduate and 
graduate students pursuing studies in fields of space science and 
engineering. 

The Travel Grants, in the amount of $500, enable student recipients 
to attend professional meetings to present their research. The Spring 
2015 Travel Grant application deadline is April 1, 2015. Jerry Soffen, 
a biologist by training, led a distinguished career in NASA, 
including serving as the Project Scientist for Viking and as an 
architect for the NASA Astrobiology Institute. The Travel Grant 
continues Jerry's dedication to educating and involving future 
generations in space science and engineering pursuits. The electronic 
application materials and instructions are located on the Soffen Fund 
website: 

http://SoffenFund.org

Questions regarding the application or application process may be sent

[NASA] PDS - NASA SCIENCE LABORATORY RELEASE 8

The NASA Planetary Data System announces the eighth release of data 
from the Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) mission, covering data acquired 
from Sol 708 through Sol 804 (August 3, 2014 through November 10, 
2014).

This release consists of raw and derived data sets from the following
instruments:

APXS
ChemCam
CheMin
DAN
Hazcam
MAHLI
MARDI
Mastcam
Navcam
RAD
REMS
SAM
SPICE

To access the above data for this release:

http://pds.nasa.gov/subscription_service/SS-20150316.html

Links to all MSL data sets may be found on the PDS Geosciences Node web
site: 

http://pds-geosciences.wustl.edu/missions/msl/ 

The data may also be reached from the main PDS home page: 

http://pds.nasa.gov/

MSL data are archived at the PDS Atmospheres, Planetary Plasma 
Interactions (PPI), Geosciences, Imaging, and Navigation and Ancillary 
Information Facility (NAIF) Nodes.

PDS offers two services for searching the MSL archives:

The Planetary Image Atlas at the Imaging Node allows selection of MSL
image data by specific search criteria:

http://pds-imaging.jpl.nasa.gov/search

The MSL Analyst's Notebook at the Geosciences Node allows searching and
downloading of all MSL data in the context of mission events:

EARLY E-ELT SCIENCE: SPECTROSCOPY WITH HARMONI

29th June - 3rd July 2015 at the Oxford University Museum of Natural 
History, Oxford UK.

This workshop will explore some of the first science that will emerge
from the European Extremely Large Telescope (E-ELT) in the next decade. 
With a 39m diameter primary mirror, E-ELT will be the largest visible 
and infrared telescope in the world, and its science will be 
transformational. The primary spectroscopic capability of E-ELT at
first light will be provided by the HARMONI instrument, a visible and
near-infrared integral field spectrograph that will be capable of
working close to the diffraction limit of the telescope (when fed by
adaptive optics) or in natural seeing mode.

The meeting will bring together experts spanning a wide range of
observational programmes, from planetary science to cosmology.

Abstract submission deadline for talks - 27th March

Early registration payment deadline - 24th April

information, please visit the conference web site:

NASA POSTDOCTORAL FELLOWSHIPS

The NASA Postdoctoral Program (NPP) provides opportunities for 
scientists and engineers to conduct research largely of their own 
choosing, yet compatible with the research opportunities posted on the 
NPP Web site.  

Selected by a competitive peer-review process, NPP Fellows complete 
one- to three-year Fellowship appointments that advance NASA's 
missions in Earth science, heliophysics, astrophysics, planetary 
science, astrobiology, space bioscience, aeronautics and engineering, 
human exploration and operations, and space technology.

An example of one of the research opportunities in planetary science 
is:

https://www3.orau.gov/NPDoc/Catalog/18421

Applicants must have a Ph.D. or equivalent degree in hand before 
beginning the fellowship, but may apply while completing the degree 
requirements. U. S. citizens, Lawful Permanent Residents, and foreign 
nationals eligible for J-1 status as a Research Scholar may apply.

Stipends start at $53,500 per year, with supplements for high 
cost-of-living areas and for certain academic specialties. Financial 
assistance is available for relocation and health insurance, and 
$8,000 per year is provided for professional travel.

Applications are accepted three times each year: March 1, July 1, and 
November 1.

UNDERGRADUATE AND GRADUATE STUDENT TRAVEL AWARDS FOR COMPARATIVE 
CLIMATOLOGY OF TERRESTRIAL PLANETS CONFERENCE #2 (CCTP2)

Limited student travel support may be available for U.S. citizens or

[NASA] DELAY OF DUE DATE AND 2018 LAUNCH READINESS DATE SIMPLEX

This amendment to ROSES-2014 delays the Step-2 date for proposals to 
program element C.21, Small, Innovative Missions for Planetary 
Exploration (SIMPLEx) and the launch readiness date to July 2018.

SLS confirms that the EM-1 launch readiness date will be July 18, 2018. 
We are very sorry for the inconvenience this has caused to our 
community of science investigators who are being asked to revise their 
proposals once more. We hope that the July 2018 date will allow 
investigators to propose even more compelling science investigations 
beyond Earth orbit. No additional changes are anticipated.

We have also allocated more time for proposers to update proposals to 
adhere to this launch readiness schedule. Proposers that have already 
submitted a Step 2 proposal are encouraged to update their proposal 
and resubmit. The due date for SIMPLEx Step-2 proposals has been 
extended to April 10, 2015.
