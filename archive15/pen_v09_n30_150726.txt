AGU 2015 SESSION 7784: MAGNETOSPHERES IN THE INNER SOLAR SYSTEM

We encourage abstract submissions to session SM017, "Magnetospheres in 
the Inner Solar System," at the fall AGU meeting in San Francisco, 
December 14-18, 2015. The abstract submission deadline is Wednesday, 
August 5. Further details are given below. 

Conveners: Gina A. DiBraccio, Daniel J. Gershman, Marissa F. Vogt

The structure and dynamics of each planetary magnetosphere (intrinsic
nd induced) in the inner solar system are driven by a unique set of 
factors including the nature of its magnetization, atmosphere-
ionosphere coupling, and local solar wind parameters. To provide a 
forum for discussion of recent data analysis and modeling efforts 
concerning the inner planet magnetospheres, this session welcomes 
submissions on the intrinsic magnetospheres of Mercury and Earth, 
as well as the induced magnetospheres of Venus and Mars. It will 
focus on general magnetospheric processes including, but not limited 
to: solar wind-magnetosphere interaction, magnetosphere-ionosphere 
coupling, plasma acceleration and transport, magnetic reconnection, 
wave instabilities, magnetotail dynamics, and bow shock physics. We 
strongly encourage comparative studies of these inner solar system 
magnetospheres with each other or with other planetary magnetospheres 
throughout the solar system.

AGU 2015 SESSION 7905 -  A DECADE'S OBSERVANCE OF A HABITABLE WORLD

This year marks the 10th anniversary of the discovery of the geysering 
south polar terrain of Saturn's small icy moon, Enceladus, and ten 
years of routine observing and studying its activity from the Cassini 
spacecraft. Over the course of the last decade, it has become 
increasingly clear that Enceladus' geysers erupt from a large, 
long-lived, sub-ice-shell liquid water reservoir, chemically suitable 
for the sustenance of biological processes and directly accessible to 
sampling and analysis. And by the time this session is convened, two 
of the last 3 close, targeted flybys that Cassini will make of 
Enceladus will have been completed and the data available for 
presentation. In this session, we will focus on the most recent 
observational, theoretical and modeling results on the chemistry, state 
and dynamics of Enceladus' geysers, the moon's thermal and interior 
state, geologic activity, as well as its astrobiological potential.

Come celebrate 10 phenomenal years with us in San Francisco!

Deadline to submit an abstract: 5 August 2015, 11:59 P.M. EDT

AGU 2015 SESSION 7990: RADAR INVESTIGATIONS OF PLANETARY SURFACES AND 
SUBSURFACES

Proposed and existing radar instruments are enabling an unprecedented 
range of radio geophysical observations of the surfaces and subsurfaces 
of solar system bodies. This has spurred the development and 
application of new instrumentation, processing, modeling, analysis, and 
interpretation approaches to planetary radar science and engineering.  
We invite abstracts on any topic involving the use of radar data to 
understand planetary bodies. These may describe (but are not limited 
to) new results from existing radar observations, the development and 
application of new observation or data processing techniques, numerical 
modeling of existing or future observations, and/or the analysis of 
airborne or orbital radar data from terrestrial analog studies for 
solar system observation.

Invited presentations will be given by Donald Blankenship, Lorenzo 
Bruzzone, Alexander Hayes, and Jennifer Whitten.

Please consider submitting an abstract for this session. For more

AGU 2015 SESSION 8936: MAGMA CHANNELIZATION ACROSS THE SOLAR SYSTEM

Please consider proposing to this session at the fall AGU Meeting.

Convenors:  David A. Williams (Arizona State University), Christopher 
Hamilton (University of Arizona), C. Michael Lesher (Laurentian 
University)

Summary: Understanding magma emplacement mechanisms are important in 
volcanology, planetary science, and economic geology. On Earth, much 
work is being done to understand better how magma emplacement is 
focused in channels, tubes, and conduits, and the relative roles of 
construction vs. thermo-mechanical erosion in their formation. On 
Earth, it is clear that most magmatic Ni-Cu-PGE deposits and some Cr 
deposits occur in lava channels and magma conduits, so they also have
important economic implications. And across the Solar System, new 
data from NASA missions continues to reveal more detailed morphological 
and compositional information about extraterrestrial lava flows. We 
propose this session to bring together terrestrial and planetary 
volcanologists and economic geologists to review the latest results 
from our various studies, and to identify topics that would benefit 
from future collaboration and joint research.

The abstract submission site is now open. Please submit your abstracts 
by Wednesday, 5 August 23:59 EDT/03:59 +1 GMT.

NASA POSTDOCTORAL FELLOWSHIPS

The NASA Postdoctoral Program (NPP) provides opportunities for 
scientists and engineers to conduct research largely of their own 
choosing, yet compatible with the research opportunities posted on the 
NPP Web site.

Selected by a competitive peer-review process, NPP Fellows complete 
one- to three-year Fellowship appointments that advance NASA's missions 
in Earth science, heliophysics, astrophysics, planetary science, 
astrobiology, space bioscience, aeronautics and engineering, human 
exploration and operations, and space technology.

An example of one of the research opportunities in planetary science 
is:

https://www3.orau.gov/NPDoc/Catalog/18715

Applicants must have a Ph.D. or equivalent degree in hand before 
beginning the fellowship, but may apply while completing the degree 
requirements. U.S. citizens, Lawful Permanent Residents, and foreign 
nationals eligible for J-1 status as a Research Scholar may apply.

Stipends start at $53,500 per year, with supplements for high 
cost-of-living areas and for certain academic specialties. Financial 
assistance is available for relocation and health insurance, and 
$8,000 per year is provided for professional travel.

Applications are accepted three times each year: March 1, July 1, 
and November 1.

NRC CUBESATS SYMPOSIUM

The NRC Committee on Achieving Science Goals with CubeSats is hosting 
a community symposium on September 2-3 at the Beckman Center in 
Irvine, CA, to explore the feasibility of obtaining high-priority 
science data using CubeSats. The symposium will feature a series of 
panel discussions among scientists and technologists in the areas of 
Earth science, solar and space physics (heliophysics), planetary 
science, astronomy and astrophysics, as well as technology that 
enables CubeSats, technology development enabled by CubeSats, and 
industry capabilities. The panels will explore science goals, how these 
goals could be achieved using CubeSats, and the potential for new 
science that is enabled by CubeSats. These discussions will be framed 
by current CubeSat technological capabilities and those anticipated in 
the near future.

The Committee is also soliciting posters as critical inputs to the 
symposium that will be displayed at a poster session. Posters should be 
targeted to one or more of the following: current CubeSat missions and 
science results, CubeSat mission concepts, or technology that enables 
CubeSat science missions. Of particular interest are posters concerning 
CubeSat-enabled microgravity science.
