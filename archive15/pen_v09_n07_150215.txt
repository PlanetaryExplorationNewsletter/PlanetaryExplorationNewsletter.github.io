IAU-GA FOCUS MEETING FM9: “HIGHLIGHTS IN THE EXPLORATION ON SMALL 
WORLDS”

Aug 11-13, 2015

This Focus Meeting will highlight results obtained from various 
ongoing space missions to small Solar System bodies (Rosetta, Dawn, 
New Horizons, Cassini-Huygens, HERSCHEL, Gaia, ...), as well as 
recent achievements obtained from other space facilities, including 
past space missions, ground-based telescopes, and geochemical 
analyses.

The meeting aims at discussing aspects of the Solar System formation
and evolution, through studies on the complex and rich evolution of
the diverse small bodies of the Solar system. The meeting will also
address the cosmo-chemistry and physical properties across the
continuum of small bodies (asteroids, comets, planetary satellites,
dwarf planets, main-belt comets), with the objective to better
understand their interrelations in the context of planetary formation.

AOGS2015 SESSION AS-24: 2015 HYDROXYL LAYER ON EARTH AND OTHER PLANETS

Asia Oceania Geosciences Conference 2015 
August 2 - 7, Singapore

A session dedicated to the study of the Hydroxyl airglow layer in the 
atmospheres of the Earth and other planets will be held at this year's 
Asia Oceania Geosciences Conference in August in Singapore. 

Presentations which deal with the details of the morphology, temporal 
variability, photochemistry and the nature of its response to dynamical 
disturbances are invited. This includes presentations on ground and 
satellite observations, model simulations, as well as new observation 
techniques and theoretical research that can help advance our knowledge 
of the excited hydroxyl layer parameters, formation and relaxation on 
Earth, Mars and Venus. This session is intended to support discussion 
and collaboration on the understanding of this airglow emission and 
possible differences in its formation on different planets. 

The abstract submission deadline is February 18, 2015.

ABSCICON 2015 SESSION - HABITABILITY FROM AFAR: CHALLENGES AND TRIUMPHS 
OF EXPLORING ICY WORLDS FROM ORBITAL AND FLYBY MISSIONS

Consider joining us in Chicago this June for the upcoming Astrobiology 
Science Conference! 

This session welcomes discussion of mission and measurement strategies 
for determining the habitability of icy worlds from afar. Robotic 
missions to explore icy worlds, such as the upcoming Jupiter Icy 
Satellite Explorer, are limited by available resources and technology, 
so that constraints on habitability must be obtained from orbit or 
through multiple flybys. We welcome contributions on past, present, and 
future missions, lessons learned, and hypotheses to be tested.

Abstract submission (deadline March 4!) and details of AbSciCon 2015 
are available at:

ABSCICON 2015 SESSION ON DWARF PLANETS

You are invited to submit an abstract to the following session of the 
Astrobiology Science Conference 2015 that will take place in Chicago 
(IL) on June 15-19, 2015. Looking forward to meeting you there!

Theme - Habitable Worlds in Our Solar System 
Session Title - Habitability of Dwarf Planets: State of the Landscape 
(Right) Before Dawn and New Horizons

Summary: Icy dwarf planets have been identified early on as targets 
of major astrobiological significance. 2015 celebrates these objects 
with two missions, Dawn and New Horizons, which will reach Ceres 
(April) and Pluto and Charon (July), respectively. This conjunction 
of missions offers the prospect for exciting comparative planetology 
between the warm icy body Ceres and the frigid Pluto and Charon. All 
display evidence for recent or ongoing activity and are suspected to 
have hosted extensive hydrothermal activity. This session will review 
our state of understanding of that class of objects in the anticipation 
of imminent new observations of Ceres and Pluto/Charon, but more 
generally in the context of the many observations of dwarf planets 
returned over the past decade.

ICARUS SPECIAL ISSUE: MICROMARS TO MEGAMARS

Guest editors: N. Bridges, C. Dundas, and L. Edgar 

Special issue description:

Whereas on Earth the study of geology evolved from one of field work 
to incorporation of remote sensing, that of Mars is the reverse, with 
orbital-based data only complemented by surface investigations from 
rovers in the last 10+ years. The merging of these datasets has 
yielded profound new understandings of the geologic history and modern 
processes on Mars. These include studies of mineralogy, stratigraphy, 
structural geology, surface dating, landscape modification rates, and 
many other research areas. This session seeks abstracts that 
incorporate data from surface (MSL, MER, etc.) and orbital (MRO, MEX, 
Odyssey, etc.) missions that have increased our understanding of 
Martian geology.

AOGS2015 SESSION PS-03: POLARIMETRY OF PLANETARY SYSTEMS - 
OBSERVATIONS, THEORY AND MODELS

Asia Oceania Geosciences Conference 2015 
August 2 - 7, Singapore

http://www.asiaoceania.org/society/index.asp

Abstracts due 18 February 2105

Polarimetry is a currently enjoying a rejuvenation in various 
astronomical applications. As a complementary technique to imaging and 
spectroscopy, polarization allows the investigation of scattering 
properties of variety of media ranging from planetary atmospheres, 
comets, small bodies (planetary satellites, asteroids, Kuiper Belt 
objects, etc.) to detection and characterization of exoplanets, brown 
dwarfs, star and planet forming regions; characterization of magnetic 
fields and search for optically active molecules in a search for 
habitability elsewhere than our earth. We invite contributions from 
observers, modelers, laboratory measurements, instrument designers 
and missions. We anticipate half to one day of presentations including 
oral and poster contributions.

AOGS2015 SESSION PS04: COMETS, ASTEROIDS AND OTHER SMALL BODIES OF THE 
SOLAR SYSTEM: FROM 67P/CHURYUMOV-GERASIMENKO TO CHARIKLO

Asia Oceania Geosciences Conference 2015 
August 2 - 7, Singapore

http://www.asiaoceania.org/society/index.asp

Abstracts due 18 February 2105

The composition and physical properties of Small Solar System Bodies 
(SSSBs), remnants of the formation of planets, are key to better 
understand our solar system. Increased knowledge of their surface 
properties and their potential as resources are also necessary to 
prepare for robotic and human exploration. Missions such as ESA/
Rosetta, ESA/Gaia, NASA/OSIRIS-Rex, JAXA/Hyabusa-2, NASA/Dawn and 
NASA/New Horizons, to study asteroids, comets, dwarf planets and TNOs 
are poised to provide new information on SSSBs.   This session 
welcomes abstracts on the remarkable results bringing information on 
the internal structure and composition of SSSBs based on space and 
ground-based data, numerical models, as well as instrument/mission 
concepts in the prospect of future exploration, including Rosetta/67P, 
C/SidingSpring, C/2014 Q1, C/2012 K1, Chariklo, Ceres, Vesta. We 
anticipate a half-day to a full day session.
