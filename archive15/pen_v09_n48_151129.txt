[NASA] HEOMD DRAFT REPORT FROM THE NASA ASTEROID REDIRECT MISSION
FORMULATION ASSESSMENT AND SUPPORT TEAM (ARM FAST) RELEASED FOR COMMENT

NASA posted a draft report today from the Asteroid Redirect Mission 
Formulation Assessment and Support Team (ARM FAST). The report is 
intended to support the Requirements Closure Technical Interchange 
Meeting (TIM) in mid-December of 2015. It includes responses to a set 
of high-priority questions that were derived from the Asteroid Redirect 
Robotic Mission (ARRM) engineering team's risk analysis and were needed 
to help design and develop the ARRM mission, spacecraft and capture 
system. The report also outlines an initial list of potential 
investigations that could be performed by the ARM. 

The draft report is available for download at: 

http://www.nasa.gov/feature/arm-fast

Comments to the report should be submitted to 
HQ-ARM-FAST@mail.nasa.gov by 11:59 p.m. EST, Dec. 4, 2015.
