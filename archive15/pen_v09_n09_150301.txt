ABSCICON 2015 SESSION: MARTIAN HABITABILITY AS INFORMED BY PAST AND
ONGOING ORBITAL, LANDER, AND ROVER MISSIONS

Summary (abridged): The last few decades of Mars exploration have 
greatly improved our understanding of potentially currently habitable 
regions as Mars, sites of ancient habitability, and regions of 
increased preservation potential for biomarkers. The purpose of this 
session is to highlight the recent advances in understanding of martian 
habitability through current and previous observations of Mars' 
climate, glaciology, mineralogy, surface geochemistry, and organic 
chemistry. We invite abstracts with emphasis on data return from 
landers, rovers, and orbiters on the habitability potential (present or 
past) of specific regions on Mars, but are particularly interested in 
contributions that integrate lessons from more than one platform into a 
holistic perspective on martian habitability. These results might 
derive from the Mars Science Laboratory at Gale Crater, the Opportunity 
and Spirit Rovers, recent observations made by instruments onboard 
orbiters such as the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter and Mars Express, and 
further interpretation from the Phoenix and Viking Landers.

Abstracts are due on Wednesday, March 4th at 5 pm CST:

INTERNATIONAL MEETING: RADIATION MECHANISMS OF ASTROPHYSICAL OBJECTS 
- CLASSICS TODAY

St.Petersburg, Russia, September 21-25, 2015

Studies of radiation mechanisms and processes of spectra formation in 
astrophysical objects are among the fundamental tasks of modern 
astrophysics. A powerful tool for the solution of these problems is 
provided by the theory of radiative transfer, which has been 
substantially contributed to and developed by the full member of the 
Soviet (Russian) Academy of Sciences Victor Victorovich Sobolev. The 
100th birthday anniversary of V.V. Sobolev will be celebrated on 
September 2, 2015. On this occasion the Saint-Petersburg State 
University organizes an international conference that will highlight 
recent advances in the field of interests of V.V. Sobolev. The 
conference will include plenary sessions with review talks by 
internationally recognized Russian and foreign scientists and a 
memorial session. It will continue with parallel sessions on:

- radiative transfer theory,
- physics of interstellar medium,
- physics of stellar and planetary atmospheres,
- high energy astrophysics

at which original results in various branches of modern astrophysics 
will be presented.

Key dates:

1 March 2015 - Registration and abstract submission open
31 July 2015 - Registration and abstract submission deadline
