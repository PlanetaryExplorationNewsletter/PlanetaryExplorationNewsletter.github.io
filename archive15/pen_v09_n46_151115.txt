THE 4th WORKSHOP ON BINARIES IN THE SOLAR SYSTEM

2016 June 21-23 in Prague, Czech Republic
Vila Lanna 

http://www.vila-lanna.cz/

Purpose:
The goal of the workshop is to bring together various ideas on the 
detection, characterization, formation, and implications of binary 
and multiple objects among the NEO, main-belt, Trojan, Centaur, 
TNO populations. We hope to include all of the many modes of 
observation, in all of the dynamical populations, as well as 
theory and numerical modeling of formation and evolution of these 
systems. We especially welcome the new topics of rings of small 
bodies, and heliocentric orbital pairs of asteroids and their 
implications. To maintain the small meeting atmosphere that has 
made the previous Binary workshops successful, the number of 
participants will be capped at 50.

Registration:
Please register early. The participation fee is 5400 CZK (approx. 
200 EUR, or 225 USD). The registration will be closed on April 20 or 
when the number of participants reaches 50.

LCO:
Petr Pravec, Petr Scheirich, Josef Durech, and Alan Harris 
 
SOC:
Alan Harris, Petr Prave, Al Conrad, Agnieszka Kryszczynska, 
Bill Merline, Mike Nolan, Keith Noll, and Dan Scheeres

PHD OPPORTUNITY IN AUSTRALIA

The Geoscience Atom Probe facility and Department of Applied Geology 
at Curtin University is offering up to three international or domestic 
PhD scholarships (plus stipend) related to the development and 
application of atom probe microscopy of geological materials. The PhDs 
will form part of a major research initiative, the Advanced Resource 
Characterisation Facility (ARCF), to develop new technologies for 
geoscience research. The initiative represents a major collaborative 
investment by the Science and Industry Endowment Fund, Curtin 
University, the CSIRO and the University of Western Australia. The 
deadline for applications is 30 November, but candidates may be 
considered after this date if suitable applications are not received 
by the deadline.
 
Details of the specific projects and contacts are available at:

W. O. CROSBY POSTDOCTORAL FELLOWSHIP, MIT

The Department of Earth, Atmospheric and Planetary Sciences at the 
Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) invites applications for 
the W. O. Crosby Postdoctoral Fellowship. The fellowship supports 
exceptional early-career scientists in the fields of geology, 
geochemistry, or geobiology. Crosby Fellows pursue independent 
research but are encouraged to collaborate with one or more researchers 
in the department. A faculty mentor hosts each fellow. Prospective 
fellows are encouraged to contact members of the department to discuss 
possible collaborations. The fellowship term is two years, and includes 
an annual stipend of $62,000 plus an allowance of up to $7,000 per year 
for research, relocation and health care expenses. 

The start date is flexible, but should ideally fall between June 1, 
2016 and January 31, 2017. Applicants must have obtained a Ph.D. by 
the start date, but not more than three years before the start date. 
Applications are due by December 1, 2015, and must include a 
curriculum vitae, a list of publications, a two-page plan of research 
to be conducted during the fellowship, and three reference letters. A 
description of the application process is at:

EGU SESSION ANNOUNCEMENT 

Dear colleagues,

In light of recent work on Mars, we hope that PEN readers may consider 
submitting to the ‘Subglacial Landform and Terrain Morphometry,
Genesis, and Glaciological Significance’ session co-organized by the 
Cryospheric Sciences and Geomorphology divisions (CR4.4/GM10.6) at the 
EGU 2016 General Assembly (Vienna, 12-22 April). This session aims to 
bring together people working on any aspect of subglacial terrain and 
landform morphometry and genesis. We invite contributions that include, 
but are not limited to:

- Morphometric inventories of subglacial landforms;
- The morphometric characterization of subglacial terrain as a 
  continuous field (e.g., subglacial roughness);
- Morphometric method development (e.g., mapping methodologies; new 
  metrics);
- Subglacial terrain/landform DEM creation and processing (e.g., SfM 
  DEMs; palaeo topography reconstruction; DEM preprocessing);
- Subglacial sediment-landform associations;
- Subglacial landform genetic models and their testing;
- The use of subglacial landforms in palaeoglaciological 
  reconstructions; 
- Observations from contemporary subglacial environments

Full session description at: 

http://meetingorganizer.copernicus.org/EGU2016/session/21463

The abstract submission deadline is January 13th 2016, 13:00 CET. 

The deadline for Support applications is December 1, 2015. For details,

HUMANS TO MARS (H2M) SUMMIT

Register Today for the 2016 Humans to Mars Summit (H2M). 

Join us at the Humans to Mars Summit (H2M) that will be held from 
May 17-19, 2016 at The George Washington University in Washington, DC.  
 
H2M is an annual Mars exploration conference that addresses the major 
technical, scientific, and policy challenges that need to be overcome 
in order to send humans to Mars by the 2030s. It is the most 
comprehensive conference in the world focused on landing humans on 
Mars, and the 2016 H2M is shaping up to be the biggest H2M yet.
 
Confirmed and tentative speakers already include Dava Newman, Buzz 
Aldrin, Ellen Stofan, Bill Nye ("The Science Guy"), James Green, Miles 
O'Brien (PBS, CNN), Penelope Boston, 'Astronaut Abby' Harrison, Joe 
Cassady (Aerojet Rocketdyne), and many more.
