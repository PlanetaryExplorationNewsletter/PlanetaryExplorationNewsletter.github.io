AGU 2015 SESSION 7445: VOLCANISM AND TECTONISM ACROSS THE SOLAR SYSTEM 
(P038)

There will be a session on planetary volcanism and tectonism at this 
year's AGU Fall Meeting, 14-18 December. Please consider submitting an 
abstract for this session. Further details are provided below.

Our invited speakers are:
Lauren Jozwiak (Brown University) and

The submission deadline is Wednesday, August 5, 2015.

https://agu.confex.com/agu/fm15/preliminaryview.cgi/Session7445

Session Description:
Volcanism and tectonism are two of the most ubiquitous processes at 
work in the Solar System, shaping substantially the surfaces of worlds 
as diverse as the terrestrial planets, main-belt asteroids, and icy 
satellites. Through a combination of solicited and contributed 
presentations, this session will host observational, laboratory, 
theoretical, or analogue fieldwork research into any aspect of 
planetary volcanic and tectonic activity. We particularly welcome 
submissions that compare landforms and processes on multiple bodies, 
and how lessons from specific studies can be applied to understanding 
volcanism and tectonism across the Solar System.

Conveners:
Thomas Platz (MPS/PSI), Paul Byrne (LPI), Matteo Massironi (Univ. 
Padua), and Debra Buczkowski (APL)

AGU 2015 SESSION 7539: THE SCIENCE OF EXPLORATION AS ENABLED BY THE 
MOON, NEAR EARTH ASTEROIDS AND THE MOONS OF MARS (P033)

Requesting abstract submissions to session P033, "The Science of 
Exploration as Enabled by the Moon, Near Earth Asteroids and the 
Moons of Mars," at AGU in San Francisco, December 14-18, 2015. 
Abstract submission deadline is Wednesday, August 5.

A close collaboration between science, technology and exploration will 
enable deeper understanding of the Moon and other airless bodies as we 
move further out of low-Earth orbit. The Solar System Exploration 
Research Virtual Institute (SSERVI) will focus on the scientific 
aspects of exploration as they pertain to the Moon, Near Earth 
Asteroids (NEAs) and the moons of Mars. This session will feature 
interdisciplinary, exploration-related science centered around all 
airless bodies targeted as potential human destinations. Areas of 
study reported here will represent the broad spectrum of lunar, NEA, 
and Martian moon sciences encompassing investigations of the surface, 
interior, exosphere, and near-space environments as well as science 
uniquely enabled from these bodies. Abstracts from the entire 
community are welcomed and encouraged.

Conveners: Brad Bailey, Yvonne Pendleton, Gregory Schmidt and 
Doris Daou.

AGU 2015 SESSION 8234. MERCURY AFTER MESSENGER

We are pleased to announce a session on Mercury at the 2015 AGU Fall 
Meeting in San Francisco, CA, December 14-18, 2015.

NASA's MESSENGER spacecraft completed more than four years of orbital 
operations at Mercury in April 2015. The mission returned 
unprecedented measurements of Mercury's surface, interior, exosphere, 
and magnetosphere that collectively have revolutionized our 
understanding of the innermost planet. This session will highlight 
results from the most recent, highest-resolution observations returned 
by MESSENGER, as well as results from analysis of the six years of 
flyby and orbital data from this highly successful mission, to 
understand Mercury's geological evolution, the planet's geophysical 
and geochemical characteristics, and the interaction of the planet's 
exosphere and magnetosphere with the solar wind and interplanetary 
magnetic field. We also welcome contributed papers on complementary 
ground-based observations, laboratory measurements, theoretical 
developments relevant to planetary processes at Mercury, and future 
mission opportunities.

Please consider submitting an abstract for this session. For more 
information,visit:

The submission deadline is this Wednesday, August 5, 2015.

Conveners:
Paul Byrne (Lunar and Planetary Institute)
Larry Nittler (Carnegie Institution of Washington)

AGU 2015 SESSION 8728: VESTA AND CERES AS SEEN BY DAWN AND EARTH-BASED 
INSTRUMENTS (P037)

There will be a session on the largest two planetary bodies within the 
main asteroid belt at this year’s AGU Fall Meeting, 14-18 December 
2015. Though the session is focused on Ceres and Vesta, presentations 
on recent advances in small body research are welcome.

Our invited speakers are:
Carol A. Raymond (JPL)
Andrew S. Rivkin (APL)
Francesca Zambon (INAF)
Lucille Le Corre (PSI/MPS)

Please consider submitting an abstract for this session. Further 
details are provided below.

Abstract submission deadline is 5 August 2015.
 
https://agu.confex.com/agu/fm15/preliminaryview.cgi/Session8728

Session Description:
Ceres and Vesta are the largest bodies in the main asteroid belt. 
Unlocking their geological histories will advance our understanding of 
how proto-planets form and evolve. This session is focused on Dawn 
mission data and its three onboard instruments: two framing cameras 
(FC), the visible and IR spectrometer (VIR), and the gamma-ray and 
neutron spectrometer (GRaND). First results from Ceres observations 
constitute the highlights of this session supplemented by thorough 
investigations on Vesta geology. Complementary Earth-based (ground and 
orbital) observations along with laboratory, numerical, and theoretical 
applications and analyses are particular welcome.

Conveners: Thomas Platz (MPS/PSI), Andreas Nathues (MPS), Eleonora 
Ammannito (UCLA), Vishnu Reddy (PSI)

AGU 2015 SESSION 9160: USING CURRENT CHEMISTRY AND MINERALOGY DATA TO GUIDE 
FUTURE DISCOVERIES FROM MARS 2020 (P035)

This session will focus on understanding the diversity of martian 
surface chemistries and mineralogies, specifically in preparation for 
future Mars missions. There is a wealth of evidence from a wide range 
of observations that suggests that the surface of Mars records a 
diversity of environments with complicated geologic histories. As we 
prepare to return to Mars in 2020, questions about how to interpret 
our current data sets remain. Are there any potential biosignatures 
that have already been observed? What additional data would we need to 
confirm them? Are there new types of geologic materials or terrestrial 
analogs that we should examine to elucidate these signatures on Mars? 
Of particular interest are studies synthesizing results from in situ, 
remote sensing, field, and/or laboratory studies that provide 
suggestions for future martian materials of interest.

Deadline to submit an abstract: 5 August 2015, 11:59 P.M. EDT

GSA 2015 SESSION T176: PAST AND PRESENT BIOSIGNATURE RECOGNITION ON
EARTH AND MARS

Research into biosignature recognition is rapidly evolving, 
particularly as our understanding of life’s ability to thrive and 
survive in extreme environments expands. Despite these advances, 
unambiguous biosignatures are difficult to diagnose. Biosignatures 
(in the rock record) are preserved fingerprints of life interacting 
with fluid and rock, particularly where microbes enhance mineral 
precipitation during deposition and/or early diagenesis. However, 
establishing biogenicity of putative biosignatures and preservation of 
any type of microbial fossil or chemical or textural biosignature 
depends on the degree of alteration during diagenesis and factors such 
as exposure to diagenetic fluids. In order to effectively determine the 
best practices for the interpretation of biosignatures of present 
and/or past life on Earth or other planets, there exists a crucial 
need for a forum for discussion of: 

- What constitutes a modern biosignature
- How biosignatures are formed
- How biosignatures are preserved and/or altered throughout geologic
  time

This session will address these issues and facilitate further advances 
in the search for life on exoplanets. 

We look forward to seeing you at GSA in Baltimore
