[NASA] NASA SEEKS REVIEWERS FOR 2015 UNDERGRADUATE STUDENT INSTRUMENT 
PROPOSALS

NASA is currently seeking volunteer mail-in reviewers for the 2015 
Undergraduate Student Instrument Project proposals. Signing up does 
not commit you to provide reviews, nor will NASA be obligated to 
invite you to do so, this is just an opportunity for us find some 
subject matter experts and for you to gain some review experience and 
help NASA. For more information see:

THE INTERIOR EXPLORATION USING SEISMIC INVESTIGATIONS GEODESY AND HEAT 
TRANSPORT (INSIGHT) PARTICIPATING SCIENTIST PROGRAM

The objectives of the program are to: 

a) enhance the scientific return from the InSight mission by 
broadening participation in the mission, and 
b) augment the existing InSight science team to include new members 
conducting investigations that broaden and/or complement the funded 
InSight Principal Investigator (PI)-led investigations. 

The goal of the InSight PSP is to maximize the contribution of InSight 
to the future exploration and scientific understanding of Mars and the 
other terrestrial-type planets. 

Notices of intent are requested by January 5, 2016 and proposals are 
due March 1, 2016.
 
This program element does not collect a data management plan via the 
NSPIRES cover pages, as some aspects of data archiving must be 
included in the body of the proposal and will be evaluated as part of 
merit, see Section 3.3, Evaluation Criteria.

SCIENTIFIC BALLOONING TECHNOLOGIES WORKSHOP ANNOUNCEMENT

We are pleased to announce a workshop dedicated to discussing 
technologies for scientific Ballooning.  

The Scientific Ballooning Technologies Workshop will be held in the 
Minneapolis campus of the University of Minnesota/Twin Cities. The 
2.5-day workshop will be held between May 9, and noon of May 11, 2016. 

The workshop scope includes (but is not limited to) gondola design, 
experiment-wide data acquisition and control systems, attitude control 
systems, on-board control software both for the attitude control and 
for the entire experiment, on-board computer hardware, power systems, 
telemetry systems, and thermal design and control.

The workshop will provide an opportunity for all hands-on ballooning 
practitioners to discuss the technologies we are all using to carry 
out our scientific investigations. 

More information about the workshop is available at:

http://2016balloontech.umn.edu/home

We warmly welcome you to this workshop!

[NASA] SUGGESTIONS FOR THE STANDARD ANNOUNCEMENT OF OPPORTUNITY

SMD welcomes suggestions from the proposing community on the Standard 
AO. The current (June 2014) Standard AO Template may be found at: 

http://soma.larc.nasa.gov/standardao/sao_templates.html

SMD is interested especially in constructive modifications that could 
result in shortening and/or simplifying Step 1 proposals submitted for 
2-step flight mission acquisitions. These and other suggestions should 
be submitted via E-mail by December 21, 2015 to: 

thomas.wagner@nasa.gov and washito.a.sasamoto@nasa.gov

[NASA] ROSES-15 RELEASE OF K2 GUEST OBSERVER CYCLE 4

The text in this program element is different from that which appeared 
as K2 GO Cycle 3 in program element D.7, so please read it carefully.
 
ROSES-2015 solicits proposals for the acquisition and analysis of new 
scientific data from the K2 mission:

http://keplerscience.arc.nasa.gov

K2 repurposes the space-borne hardware and ground-based operations of 
the Kepler mission for a pointed survey of predetermined locations 
along the ecliptic plane:

http://keplerscience.arc.nasa.gov

The single, visible-wavelength instrument on board K2 provides high-
precision photometry capability, with short cadence and long cadence 
modes, and provides a powerful tool for broadband variability analyses 
of planetary, stellar, extragalactic, and solar system sources.

Mandatory Step-1 proposals are due February 5, 2016, and Step-2 
proposals are due March 4, 2016.

  Polymerase chain reaction (PCR)
- Poster sessions
- Participant-led discussions
