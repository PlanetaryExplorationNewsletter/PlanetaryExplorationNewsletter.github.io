EPSC: MARSSI USER WORKSHOP

Location: Room Mars, La Cité des Congrès, Nantes, France
Time/date: Wed, 30 Sep, 14:00–15:30

MarsSI (MARS System of information) is a web Geographic Information 
System application which allows managing and processing of Martian 
orbital data. From this application, the users are able to easily and 
rapidly select observations, to process raw data via proposed automatic 
pipelines and to get back final products which can be visualized under 
Geographic Information Systems like ARCGIS and QGIS. Also, MarsSI 
proposes automatic stereo-restitution pipelines to produce Digital 
Terrain Models (DTMs) from CTX and HIRISE stereo pairs. This 
application is part of the ERC project e-Mars founding from the 
European Union’s Seventh Framework Program (FP7/2007-2013) (ERC Grant 
Agreement No. 280168).

A 1 1/2-hour workshop will be held at 2 pm Wednesday, September 30 
during European Planetary Science Congress 2015 (Nantes, France) for 
community members using martian orbital data. In the workshop, we will 
present and describe the basic functions of MarsSI (data processing, 
stereo-restitution...).

LOWELL OBSERVATORY: TENURE-TRACK OR TENURED ASTRONOMER

Lowell Observatory invites applications for one or more tenure-track 
or tenured research positions in astronomy or planetary science. We 
invite applicants at any career level who can build on current 
strengths or open new areas for Lowell. A Ph.D. in astronomy, 
planetary science, or a related field is required, as is an outstanding 
record of research and demonstrated ability or potential to obtain 
external research funding. Candidates are invited to describe how they 
would make use of our observational facilities, but we will give equal 
consideration to all research areas. The start date for this position 
is flexible but desired by Fall 2016.

Additional position details can be found at:

NASA POSTDOCTORAL FELLOWSHIPS
 
The NASA Postdoctoral Program (NPP) provides opportunities for 
scientists and engineers to conduct research largely of their own 
choosing, yet compatible with the research opportunities posted on the 
NPP Web site.
 
Selected by a competitive peer-review process, NPP Fellows complete 
one- to three-year Fellowship appointments that advance NASA’s missions 
in Earth science, heliophysics, astrophysics, planetary science, 
astrobiology, space bioscience, aeronautics and engineering, human 
exploration and operations, and space technology.
 
An example of one of the research opportunities in planetary science 
is:
 
https://apps.orau.gov/NPDoc/Catalog/17883
 
Applicants must have a Ph.D. or equivalent degree in hand before 
beginning the fellowship, but may apply while completing the degree 
requirements. U. S. citizens, Lawful Permanent Residents, and foreign 
nationals eligible for J-1 status as a Research Scholar may apply.
 
Stipends start at $53,500 per year, with supplements for high cost-of-
living areas and for certain academic specialties. Financial assistance 
is available for relocation and health insurance, and $8,000 per year 
is provided for professional travel.

Applications are accepted three times each year: March 1, July 1, and 
November 1.

[NASA] COMPETITIVE PROGRAM FOR SCIENCE MUSEUMS, PLANETARIUMS AND NASA 
VISITOR CENTERS PLUS OTHER OPPORTUNITIES 

The NASA Office of Education is issuing a NASA Research Announcement 
(NRA) to solicit proposals to support NASA-inspired S-STEM informal 
education projects, including exhibits, through partnerships with K-12 
schools or districts, youth-serving organizations, higher education, 
and/or other agencies to support Federal STEM education goals. 

Successful proposals typically will be funded as grants or cooperative 
agreements depending on the size and complexity of the proposed 
project.
 
See NASA release NNH15ZHA001N at: 

https://nspires.nasaprs.com/

An organization that is operated by a K-12 school, district, higher 
education institution, or other entity such as a planetarium, museum, 
or youth-serving organization should refer to the special instructions 
in the NRA (Section III – Eligibility).

5TH INTERNATIONAL WORKSHOP ON LUNARCUBES

Noted mathematician and artist Ed Belbruno will be a featured speaker 
at the 5th International Workshop on LunarCubes, October 6-9 in San 
Jose, CA.

Belbruno's ballistic capture, or low-energy transfer theory that 
coasted spacecraft into lunar orbit in the early 90's, has found new 
life with its possible applications for reaching Martian orbit and will 
be a major topic of discussion at the LunarCubes workshop.

Don't miss this incredible opportunity to hear firsthand how ballistic 
capture can open the Martian frontier for robotic missions, future 
manned expeditions and colonization efforts.

Ed Belbruno is also the author of Fly Me to the Moon: An insider's 
Guide to the New Science of Space Travel and the subject of a recent 
documentary, Painting the Way to the Moon, where he describes the 
strong relationship between art and science.

Register today to hear Ed Belbruno and other noted speakers at the 
5th International Workshop on LunarCubes! Regular registration rates 
end September 15, 2015.
