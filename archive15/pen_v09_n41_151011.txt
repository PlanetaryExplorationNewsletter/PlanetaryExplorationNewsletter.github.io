LEAG ANNUAL MEETING 20-22 OCTOBER 2015

The 2015 Annual Meeting of the Lunar Exploration Analysis Group will 
be held at USRA HQ (Columbia, Maryland). See:

http://www.hou.usra.edu/meetings/leag2015/ 

The meeting will bring together scientists, engineers, and commercial-
sector entrepreneurs to focus on issues involving science, exploration, 
and utilization of the Moon. The meeting goals are three-fold:

• Integrate the perspectives of the different stakeholders (science, 
  engineering, government, and private sector) to explore common goals 
  of lunar exploration regarding identification, evaluation, 
  extraction, and use of lunar resources.
• Use the results of missions to examine the dynamic nature of the 
  Moon, 
  influencing future science and exploration missions.
• Provide a forum for community updates and input into the issues that 
  affect lunar science and exploration.

The meeting will result in findings formulated through community 
consensus that will be published on the LEAG website and forwarded to 
NASA HQ (SMD and HEOMD). Time for discussion and community input will 
be made available during each session. 

Community updates from SMD and HEOMD will be given, followed by 
focused sessions that will discuss the dynamic Moon and lunar 
resources/ISRU. The meeting will be live-streamed.  Full details for 
remote access will be sent to the LEAG email list and the Lunar-L.

2016 PIERAZZO INTERNATIONAL STUDENT TRAVEL AWARD

Application deadline: 9 PM PST, November 13, 2015

Awards will be announced on or before November 30, 2015

This award is established by the Planetary Science Institute in memory 
of Senior Scientist Betty Pierazzo to support and encourage graduate 
students to build international collaborations and relationships in 
planetary science. Two awards will be made each year, contingent upon 
there being meritorious applications. One will be awarded to a graduate 
student working on his or her Ph.D. at an institution within the U.S. 
This is to support travel to a planetary science related meeting 
(conferences and workshops) outside of the U.S. The second award will 
be to a graduate student working on his or her Ph.D. at an institution 
outside of the U.S. This is to support travel to a planetary science 
related meeting within the U.S. These include general meetings that 
have planetary-focused sessions such as the AGU, GSA, EGU and IAG.

The award will consist of a certificate and up to $2000US.

scientists and engineers to conduct research largely of their own 
choosing, yet compatible with the research opportunities posted on the 
NPP Web site.
 
Selected by a competitive peer-review process, NPP Fellows complete 
one- to three-year Fellowship appointments that advance NASA’s missions 
in Earth science, heliophysics, astrophysics, planetary science, 
astrobiology, space bioscience, aeronautics and engineering, human 
exploration and operations, and space technology.

[NASA] PDS - MESSENGER DATA RELEASE 14

The Planetary Data System is pleased to announce Release 14 of data 
collected by the MErcury Surface, Space ENvironment, GEochemistry, and 
Ranging (MESSENGER) mission, including raw and calibrated products 
created from data acquired through the end of Mercury orbital 
operations on 30 April 2015.

MESSENGER's instruments are the Mercury Dual Imaging System (MDIS), 
with wide-angle and narrow-angle cameras for imaging Mercury's 
surface; a Gamma-Ray and Neutron Spectrometer (GRNS) and an X-Ray 
Spectrometer (XRS) for remote geochemical mapping; a Magnetometer (MAG) 
to measure the planetary magnetic field; a Mercury Laser Altimeter 
(MLA) to measure surface topography and planetary shape; the Mercury 
Atmospheric and Surface Composition Spectrometer (MASCS), combining 
an Ultraviolet and Visible Spectrometer (UVVS) with a Visible and 
Infrared Spectrograph (VIRS) to make high-resolution spectral 
measurements of the surface and to survey the structure and 
composition of Mercury's tenuous neutral exosphere; and an Energetic 
Particle and Plasma Spectrometer (EPPS) to characterize the charged 
particle and plasma environment of Mercury.

The final release of calibrated and advanced products is 6 May 2016.
