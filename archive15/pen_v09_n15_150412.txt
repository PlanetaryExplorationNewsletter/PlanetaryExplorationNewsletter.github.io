EDITORIAL: REFORM ROSES15 SOLAR SYSTEM WORKINGS

Mark V. Sykes
Planetary Science Institute

NASA has broken SSW into two Step 2 calls, six months apart, but 
requires a single Step 1 for both. Program managers then tell PIs to 
which Step 2 they will propose. This is nonsense. PIs need to plan (by 
the Step 1 deadline) when they are hiring students, if they can hire 
certain postdocs, if field sites are available in what timeframe, when 
they need to be trying to fill funding shortfalls, and many other 
considerations. Experience teaches that details of research can change 
significantly in more than 8 months (between the Step 1 and second 
Step 2 calls). There needs to be a separate Step 1 deadline for the 
second Step 2 call.

Furthermore, the 20 month gap between ROSES14 and ROSES15 calls for PIs
relegated to the second SSW Step 2 deadline will seriously harm many
disciplines. At least one year of bridge funding should be available to 
those funded from ROSES12 and ROSES13 in programs merged into SSW in 
those disciplines relegated to the second Step 2 call, with 
consideration for others in declining disciplines. Discipline funding 
within program elements must be tracked.

NASA POSTDOCTORAL FELLOWSHIPS

The NASA Postdoctoral Program (NPP) provides opportunities for 
scientists and engineers to conduct research largely of their own 
choosing, yet compatible with the research opportunities posted on the 
NPP Web site.

Selected by a competitive peer-review process, NPP Fellows complete 
one- to three-year Fellowship appointments that advance NASA's missions 
in Earth science, heliophysics, astrophysics, planetary science, 
astrobiology, space bioscience, aeronautics and engineering, human 
exploration and operations, and space technology.

An example of one of the research opportunities in planetary science 
is:

https://www3.orau.gov/NPDoc/Catalog/17585 

Applicants must have a Ph.D. or equivalent degree in hand before 
beginning the fellowship, but may apply while completing the degree 
requirements. U. S. citizens, Lawful Permanent Residents, and foreign
nationals eligible for J-1 status as a Research Scholar may apply.

Stipends start at $53,500 per year, with supplements for high 
cost-of-living areas and for certain academic specialties. Financial 
assistance is available for relocation and health insurance, and 
$8,000 per year is provided for professional travel.

Applications are accepted three times each year: March 1, July 1, and 
November 1.

EPSC 2015: MARS GEOMORPHOLOGY

Abstract submissions are now open for the European Planetary Science 
Congress (EPSC) 2015, 27th September to 2nd October at La Cite des 
Congres, Nantes, France. The deadline is 29 April 2015, 13:00 CET.

We cordially invite you to submit your abstracts to the session TP7 
"Mars geomorphology in the late Amazonian epoch". This session aims to 
explore the recent and current (or even ongoing) surface processes on 
Mars. Contributions are welcome concerning remote sensing, climate, 
Earth-analogue, modelling and laboratory studies.

THE FORUM FOR NEW LEADERS IN SPACE SCIENCE

The Space Studies Board of U.S. National Academy of Sciences' National 
Research Council and the National Space Science Center of the Chinese 
Academy of Sciences invite applications for the 2015-16 Forum for New 
Leaders in Space Science. The Forum's 2015-2016 session will provide 
opportunities for a highly select group of young Earth and planetary 
scientists from the United States and China to discuss their research 
activities in an intimate and collegial environment at meetings to be 
held in Shanghai, China (9-10 October, 2015) and Irvine, California 
(16-17 May, 2016). The application deadline is 29 May, 2015. Details 
can be found at:

SMALL BODIES ASSESSMENT GROUP 13TH MEETING: EARLY CAREER TRAVEL SUPPORT
AND AGENDA

The 13th meeting of the Small Bodies Assessment Group (SBAG) will be 
held June 29 to midday July 1 in Washington, DC. 

1) Early career travel support: We are pleased to be able to offer 
limited US travel support for a few early career scientists to 
participate in the SBAG 13 meeting. Interested graduate students, 
postdocs, and other early career scientists (within 3 years of 
PhD/MS/BS) should email a one-page letter and a CV to Nancy Chabot by 
April 24, 2015.

2) As we get the SBAG 13 agenda together, we'd like to give any team 
that submitted a small body related Discovery mission proposal the 
opportunity to briefly share their submitted concept with the community 
on June 30. Please pass this invitation along to any teams you were 
involved with, and contact Nancy Chabot to be added to the agenda. 

Also, both the Dawn and New Horizons teams have provided great slide 
sets:

As public interest continues to grow in these missions, please use 
these slides to share the excitement with the public at any possible 
opportunity!
