[NASA] PDS – RELEASE OF CASSINI/RADIO AND PLASMA WAVE SCIENCE DATA

The Planetary Data System (PDS) announces the release of Cassini/Radio 
and Plasma Wave Science (RPWS) higher level Langmuir probe (LP) data. 
This release includes electron densities and temperatures derived from 
the analyses of LP sweeps for targeted Titan flybys through T93, 
electron densities using spacecraft potential as a proxy for data into 
mid-2010. Calibrated current-voltage data for all sweeps through 2014 
day 119 are included for those who wish to do their own sweep analyses.   

And, a fourth data set including calibrated currents vs. time at fixed 
probe potentials are available as a product which reflects higher 
temporal resolution variations of the electron density than that 
available from the sweeps. However, one would likely use densities 
derived from nearby sweeps to convert the relative densities to 
calibrated densities.

Additions to these data sets will occur periodically until the data
coverage is complete.

AEOLIAN RESEARCH SPECIAL ISSUE FOR THE FOURTH INTERNATIONAL PLANETARY  
DUNES WORKSHOP  

The Fourth International Planetary Dunes Workshop: Integrating Models,  
Remote Sensing, and Field Data was held May 19–22, 2015 in Boise, 
Idaho. See:

http://www.hou.usra.edu/meetings/dunes2015/dunes20153rd.shtml

More than 60 researchers and students participated in two and a half 
days of presentations and lively discussion, plus a full day field 
trip to Bruneau Dunes State Park. The workshop focused on the many 
landforms and deposits created by the dynamic interactions between 
granular material and airflow (aeolian processes). These processes are 
known to occur on several planetary bodies, including Earth, Mars, 
Titan, Venus, and most recently the surface of a comet.   

A special issue in Aeolian Research is planned to highlight the results  
presented at the workshop, in addition to other recent aeolian studies  
of planetary surfaces. Manuscripts on any topic within planetary  
aeolian studies are solicited, but those focusing on planetary dune  
systems are particularly encouraged. While terrestrial analog studies  
are welcome for the special issue, these manuscripts should include  
discussion of how the results relate to the analysis of features in  
planetary environments.   

Please send an email (as an indication of interest) that includes a  
working title, proposed author list, and two-sentence description of  
the manuscript to chojan1@pirl.lpl.arizona.edu by August 29, 2015.  
Deadline for submission of final manuscripts is February 1, 2016.
