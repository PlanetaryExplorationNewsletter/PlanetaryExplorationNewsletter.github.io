FALL AGU SPECIAL SESSION: CARBON ON MARS

We are organizing a special session on the general topic of carbon on 
Mars at the upcoming Fall AGU Meeting. We hope to receive contributions 
addressing a wide range of relevant topics, including: accretion, core 
formation, mantle geochemistry, formation of crust, outgassing of 
carbon species, climate evolution, sequestration (and recycling?) of 
carbon, organic chemistry on Mars, preservation of biosignatures, and 
future experiments addressing carbon characterization and life 
detection.

Deadline to submit an abstract: 5 August 2015, 11:59 P.M. EDT

We are looking forward to an interesting session!

FALL AGU SPECIAL SESSION P035: USING CURRENT CHEMISTRY AND MINERALOGY 
DATA TO GUIDE FUTURE DISCOVERIES FROM MARS 2020

This session will focus on understanding the diversity of martian 
surface chemistries and mineralogies, specifically in preparation for 
future Mars missions. There is a wealth of evidence from a wide range 
of observations that suggests that the surface of Mars records a 
diversity of environments with complicated geologic histories. As we 
prepare to return to Mars in 2020, questions about how to interpret 
our current data sets remain. Are there any potential biosignatures 
that have already been observed? What additional data would we need to 
confirm them? Are there new types of geologic materials or terrestrial 
analogs that we should examine to elucidate these signatures on Mars? 
Of particular interest are studies synthesizing results from in situ, 
remote sensing, field, and/or laboratory studies that provide 
suggestions for future martian materials of interest.

Deadline to submit an abstract: 5 August 2015, 11:59 P.M. EDT

NAI DIRECTOR APPLICATION DEADLINE EXTENDED TO JULY 10, 2015

NASA seeks a new Director for the NASA Astrobiology Institute (NAI). 
The ideal candidate will be an internationally recognized scientist 
with proven experience in leading or managing large interdisciplinary 
research programs or projects, possessed with a vision for leading the 
Institute into the future. Applicants for this position should have a 
broad scientific perspective on astrobiology, experience in conducting 
interdisciplinary scientific research, and demonstrated skills needed 
to harness the strengths of disparate research communities towards a 
greater goal. S/he should understand how to grow a research endeavor 
and respond to changing budget climates while focusing on maximizing 
the scientific return on NASA's investments in astrobiology. S/he 
should have experience in leading a diverse staff ranging from 
established scientists to support personnel, resource planning, and 
executing budgets and schedules. S/he should be comfortable with modern 
information technologies and distributed research teams. NASA is 
particularly interested in applicants who will find ways to infuse 
astrobiology into NASA flight missions.

NASA POSTDOCTORAL FELLOWSHIPS

The NASA Postdoctoral Program (NPP) provides opportunities for 
scientists and engineers to conduct research largely of their own 
choosing, yet compatible with the research opportunities posted on the 
NPP Web site.

Selected by a competitive peer-review process, NPP Fellows complete 
one- to three-year Fellowship appointments that advance NASA's missions 
in Earth science, heliophysics, astrophysics, planetary science, 
astrobiology, space bioscience, aeronautics and engineering, human 
exploration and operations, and space technology.

An example of one of the research opportunities in planetary science 
is:

https://www3.orau.gov/NPDoc/Catalog/17613

Applicants must have a Ph.D. or equivalent degree in hand before 
beginning the fellowship, but may apply while completing the degree 
requirements. U.S. citizens, Lawful Permanent Residents, and foreign 
nationals eligible for J-1 status as a Research Scholar may apply.

Stipends start at $53,500 per year, with supplements for high 
cost-of-living areas and for certain academic specialties. Financial 
assistance is available for relocation and health insurance, and $8,000 
per year is provided for professional travel.

Applications are accepted three times each year: March 1, July 1, and 
November 1.
