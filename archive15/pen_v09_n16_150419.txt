SMALL BODIES ASSESSMENT GROUP 13TH MEETING: EARLY CAREER TRAVEL SUPPORT 
AND AGENDA

The 13th meeting of the Small Bodies Assessment Group (SBAG) will be 
held June 29 to midday July 1 in Washington, DC. 

1) Early career travel support: We are pleased to be able to offer 
limited US travel support for a few early career scientists to 
participate in the SBAG 13 meeting. Interested graduate students, 
postdocs, and other early career scientists (within 3 years of PhD/MS/
BS) should email a one-page letter and a CV to Nancy Chabot by April 
24, 2015.

2) As we get the SBAG 13 agenda together, we’d like to give any team 
that submitted a small body related Discovery mission proposal the 
opportunity to briefly share their submitted concept with the community 
on June 30. Please pass this invitation along to any teams you were 
involved with, and contact Nancy Chabot to be added to the agenda. 
                                                                                                           
Also, both the Dawn and New Horizons teams have provided great slide 
sets:

As public interest continues to grow in these missions, please use 
these slides to share the excitement with the public at any possible 
opportunity!

IMPENDING DEADLINES - COMPARATIVE CLIMATES OF TERRESTRIAL PLANETS II 
CONFERENCE

Deadlines are coming for the Comparative Climates of Terrestrial 
Planets II conference that will be held at NASA Ames Research Center 
in Moffett Field, California on 8-11 September 8-11, 2015.
 
Abstracts and Student Travel Requests are due Thursday, April 30th.
 
Student travel applications should include the following information:
- A one-page description of how your participation in the meeting will 
  benefit NASA’s goals of planetary exploration, particularly Venus;
- A copy of your abstract;
- Your resume;
- A statement of endorsement from a faculty member.

Student travel applications are due on the same date as the abstracts 
(April 30), but all application materials should be sent to the 
conveners (Jeff Hollingsworth, jeffery.l.hollingsworth@nasa.gov, Lori 
Glaze, lori.s.glaze@nasa.gov, and Shawn Domagal-Goldman, 
shawn.goldman@nasa.gov). Applicants will be notified of the selections 
by May 8.
 
If you are a NASA or JPL employee (or on-site contractor) and planning 
to attend this conference, you are now required to register in NCTS 
(code #22053-15). You should register in NCTS, before the end of May 
2015 in order to attend.

[NASA] DELAY OF STEP-2 DUE DATE FOR HAYABUSA2 PARTICIPATING 
SCIENTIST PROGRAM

Hayabusa-2 Participating Scientist Program Step-1 proposals were due on 
April 1, 2015, and Step-2 proposals are now listed in the Tables of due 
dates as "TBD."

This amendment delays the due date for Step-2 proposals. Planetary 
Science Division personnel are working with NASA’s international 
partners on the Hayabusa2 mission to provide additional documents and 
information about the mission for proposers to use in writing Step-2 
proposals. The new date for the Step-2 proposal deadline has not yet 
been determined, but it will be no less than four weeks after the 
additional information is provided. Until then, the Step-2 deadline 
for C.19 will be listed as TBD. NASA still anticipates that instrument 
scientist awards would receive funding starting in FY 2016, and the 
sample scientist awards would start with a small amount in FY 2017.
 
This Amendment to the NASA Research Announcement "Research 
Opportunities in Space and Earth Sciences (ROSES) 2015" (NNH15ZDA001N) 
is posted on the NASA research opportunity homepage at:

NASA POSTDOCTORAL FELLOWSHIPS
 
The NASA Postdoctoral Program (NPP) provides opportunities for 
scientists and engineers to conduct research largely of their own 
choosing, yet compatible with the research opportunities posted on the 
NPP Web site.
 
Selected by a competitive peer-review process, NPP Fellows complete 
one- to three-year Fellowship appointments that advance NASA’s missions 
in Earth science, heliophysics, astrophysics, planetary science, 
astrobiology, space bioscience, aeronautics and engineering, human 
exploration and operations, and space technology.
 
An example of one of the research opportunities in planetary science 
is:
 
https://www3.orau.gov/NPDoc/Catalog/18818  
 
Applicants must have a Ph.D. or equivalent degree in hand before 
beginning the fellowship, but may apply while completing the degree 
requirements. U. S. citizens, Lawful Permanent Residents, and foreign 
nationals eligible for J-1 status as a Research Scholar may apply.
 
Stipends start at $53,500 per year, with supplements for high cost-
of-living areas and for certain academic specialties. Financial 
assistance is available for relocation and health insurance, and 
$8,000 per year is provided for professional travel.

Applications are accepted three times each year: March 1, July 1, and 
November 1.
