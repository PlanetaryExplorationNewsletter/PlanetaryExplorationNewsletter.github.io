[NASA] NEW VOLUNTEER REVIEWER FORMS POSTED

The Science Mission Directorate is seeking subject matter experts to 
serve as mail-in and/or panel meeting reviewers of research proposals 
in Earth and Space science. We have posted new volunteer reviewer forms 
for ROSES 2014 Habitable Worlds and Astrophysics Research and Analysis 
calls and the Earth and Space Science graduate student fellowship 
programs (NESSF). To volunteer just fill out the forms at:

[NASA] APPROVAL FOR LPSC CONFERENCE HOTELS EXCEEDING GSA

Conference travel expenses exceeding GSA without approval from NASA 
could cause audit problems for some organizations later. It has been 
noted by some observant planetary scientists that the LPSC 2015 
conference hotel rate exceeds the GSA allowable lodging for that time 
and place. NASA intends to provide approval to allow those attending 
LPSC to be reimbursed for their stay, at most hotels anyway. This 
advance approval and further details will be posted as a letter from 
SARA at:

http://sara.nasa.gov

no later than Friday February 6, 2015.

POSTDOCTORAL RESEARCHER: MINERALOGY AND PETROLOGY OF PLANETARY 
MATERIALS

The Universities Space Research Association's Lunar and Planetary 
Institute, invites applications for a postdoctoral fellowship in the 
mineralogy and petrology of planetary materials.

The successful candidate will work with Dr. Allan Treiman in NASA-
funded efforts, emphasizing planetary crusts and magmas, and their 
volatile constituents and on the CheMin science team of the Mars 
Science Laboratory mission. The candidate will participate in 
analysis and interpretation of CheMin X-ray diffraction data of Mars 
surface materials; and may also participate in operations planning 
for the CheMin instrument. 

Applicants should have a recent Ph.D. in petrology or geochemistry; 
experience with planetary materials is helpful, but not required.  
The position would be for two years, with possible extension to a 
third year. The candidate must be a U.S. Citizen or Legal Permanent 
Resident, and be able to pass a detailed government background 
investigation. Applicants should send a letter of interest, a 
curriculum vita with a list of publications, a brief (maximum three 
pages) statement of research interests, and a list of three 
references to the posting at:

CONNECTION INFORMATION FOR 'POTENTIAL FOR FINDING LIFE IN A EUROPA 
PLUME' WORKSHOP LIVE BROADCAST

A live stream of the talks can be viewed at:

https://ac.arc.nasa.gov/europa

When: Wednesday, February 18, 2015 8:30am - 5pm PDT
Where: NASA ARC Bld 152, Moffett Field, California

On February 18, 2015, the NASA Astrobiology Institute (NAI) and the 
Solar System Exploration Research Virtual Institute (SSERVI) will 
co-host the workshop at NASA Ames Research Center.

Current Europa missions under study by NASA are focused on answering 
the question "Is Europa habitable?" However, the potential presence 
of water plumes on the satellite could present an opportunity to 
pursue the question "Is there life on Europa?" Answering this question 
is far more challenging because measurements currently possible may 
provide only ambiguous results from a mission that either orbits or 
flies by Europa at relatively high velocity. To that end, NASA's 
Planetary Science Division is convening a workshop to consider 
strategies to investigate Europa's putative plumes for evidence of 
life. 

Registration is free. All attendees are requested to register at 
the following website:

https://astrobiology.nasa.gov/calendar/europa-plume-workshop/
workshop-europa-plume-registration/

The workshop will be followed on Feb. 19-20 by a meeting of the Outer 
Planets Assessment Group that will also be held at Ames.

PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT OPPORTUNITY FOR UNDERGRADUATE FACULTY 

Description: 3-5 undergraduate faculty will be recruited to attend 
the Heliophysics Summer School. They will work with leading researchers 
in the field of heliophysics and develop course materials using 
heliophysics examples to illustrate important concepts in 
introductory and upper division physics, astronomy or earth science 
courses, and general science courses. During the summer school, 
faculty will be expected to work with the summer school instructors, 
other educators and each other to outline and draft teaching 
materials that they can further develop and test during the school 
year. A strong evaluation plan will be an important part of the 
expected outcome of this work. Selected faculty must be able to field 
test these materials during the semester following the summer school. 
The goal is for these materials to be submitted to NASA for product 
review and hosting on NASA repositories.

Examples of previously developed materials:

http://www.vsp.ucar.edu/Heliophysics/science-resources-
undergraduate_materials.shtml

Requirements:

1. 3 years teaching experience. Community college faculty encouraged.
2. Currently teaching physics, astronomy/planetary science, or 
   Earth sciences at the undergraduate level.
3. Willingness to work with other faculty and the HSS instructors 
   as a team to develop instructional materials.

THE FUTURE & SCIENCE OF GEMINI OBSERVATORY

June 14-18, 2015
Toronto, Canada

Registration is now open for the next Gemini Science and User Meeting. 
The Gemini Science Meeting occurs every three years. The theme of this 
year's meeting is "The Future & Science of Gemini Observatory." The 
meeting will cover a range of exciting scientific results from the 
international community, such as: Solar System, Exoplanets, Galactic 
astronomy, The Nearby Universe, Cosmic Explosions, AGNs and QSOs, and 
Distant Galaxies and Cosmology.

If you have used Gemini data in the past several years, or are 
interested in finding out more about the capabilities of the 
Observatory, please consider attending. At the User meeting there 
will be discussions on the next-generation instruments, observing 
modes and synergies with other facilities as the Observatory looks 
ahead to 2020 and beyond. In particular, the Gemini Instrument 
Feasibility Study (GIFS) teams will present their studies for the 
next Gemini instrument and your feedback is requested on the different 
concepts to be proposed.

Abstract and Early Registration (reduced fee) deadlines are both 
March 4, 2015. For further information on the program, registration,

ASTROGEOLOGY - ISIS SUPPORT

ISIS users,

As you may know the ISIS websites for documentation and support were 
unavailable from December 2, 2014 to January 23, 2015. We apologize 
for any inconvenience this may have caused you and your teams. The 
sites were partially available on January 7, and are fully functional 
as of January 23.

http://isis.astrogeology.usgs.gov/

https://isis.astrogeology.usgs.gov/IsisSupport/

The sites were taken down after an attempted malicious attack was 
discovered. The process for bringing them back on-line is a lengthy 
one involving rebuilding the servers and the content from unaffected 
sources and adhering to strict Department of the Interior procedures 
concerning their reactivation.

If you have any problems or questions please post to the support board.

Regards,
The ISIS Support Team
