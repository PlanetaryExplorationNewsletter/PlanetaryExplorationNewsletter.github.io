[NASA] THREE-DAY TRAINING COURSE ON PLANETARY PROTECTION

Course: "Planetary Protection: Policies and Practices"

Dates: February 2-4, 2016

Location: Kennedy Space Center, Florida

We cordially invite all interested parties to participate in the 
upcoming course on Planetary Protection Policies and Practices, which 
is designed to familiarize current and future practitioners with NASA, 
ESA, and COSPAR planetary protection programs. The course provides an 
overview of applicable policies, practices and procedures necessary to 
implement a successful planetary protection program, emphasizing 
integration of managerial, administrative, and laboratory activities. 
It is supported by the NASA Planetary Protection Officer. Go to:

http://planetaryprotection.nasa.gov/course

Enrollment: 14 participants

Application: contact tasalb@msn.com

OPEN SOURCE RELEASE OF THE VICAR IMAGE PROCESSING SYSTEM

The VICAR image processing system is now available in Open Source form:

http://www-mipl.jpl.nasa.gov/vicar_open.html

VICAR is an image processing system developed and used by the 
Multimission Image Processing Lab at JPL. With origins in 1966, it is 
quite possibly the oldest continuously used image processing system in 
the world.

VICAR was developed for use with JPL's planetary missions, from 
Surveyor up to the present day. The majority of JPL's planetary 
missions that have cameras use VICAR in some way, up to and including 
the current Mars landers/rovers (MER, MSL, InSight, Mars 2020).

The VICAR format is compatible with both PDS 3 and PDS 4. Many missions 
have supplied data to PDS 3 in VICAR format, with detached or attached 
PDS labels: MSL, MER, Phoenix, Cassini, Galileo, Voyager, Magellan, MEX 
(HRSC), and many older missions. InSight and Mars 2020 will supply 
VICAR images with detached labels to PDS 4.

NASA POSTDOCTORAL FELLOWSHIPS

The NASA Postdoctoral Program (NPP) provides opportunities for 
scientists and engineers to conduct research largely of their own 
choosing, yet compatible with the research opportunities posted on the 
NPP Web site.

Selected by a competitive peer-review process, NPP Fellows complete 
one- to three-year Fellowship appointments that advance NASA's missions 
in Earth science, heliophysics, astrophysics, planetary science, 
astrobiology, space bioscience, aeronautics and engineering, human 
exploration and operations, and space technology.

An example of one of the research opportunities in planetary science 
is:

https://apps.orau.gov/NPDoc/Catalog/18314

Applicants must have a Ph.D. or equivalent degree in hand before 
beginning the fellowship, but may apply while completing the degree 
requirements. U. S. citizens, Lawful Permanent Residents, and foreign 
nationals eligible for J-1 status as a Research Scholar may apply.

Stipends start at $53,500 per year, with supplements for high 
cost-of-living areas and for certain academic specialties. Financial 
assistance is available for relocation and health insurance, and 
$8,000 per year is provided for professional travel.

Applications are accepted three times each year: March 1, July 1, and 
November 1.

PLANETARY SCIENCE NUGGETS WEBSITE

We want to bring your attention to a new website where you can find
the collection of NASA SMD Planetary Science Nuggets for 2015 and 2014:

http://www.lpi.usra.edu/nuggets/

Planetary Science Nuggets are PowerPoint slides that have been provided
to NASA's SMD Planetary Science Division by members of the scientific
community to highlight important science results or mission activities.

A subset of these submissions are selected by the Planetary Science

Division to be presented to SMD leadership and potentially NASA 
leadership, OSTP, and the White House. The collection on this website 
represents those selected nuggets and will be updated as new nuggets 
are accepted.

On the website, you will also find a Powerpoint Presentation by Jim 
Green on how to prepare nuggets:

http://www.lpi.usra.edu/opag/meetings/aug2015/presentations
/day-1/2_green.pdf

Green encourages anyone in the planetary science community to submit 
nuggets.

The nugget coordinator at JPL is Lindsay Hays 
(Lindsay.E.Hays@jpl.nasa.gov); mission nuggets should be communicated 
through the mission program scientist; and R&A science nuggets should 
be communicated through the Headquarters program scientist who funded 
the work.
