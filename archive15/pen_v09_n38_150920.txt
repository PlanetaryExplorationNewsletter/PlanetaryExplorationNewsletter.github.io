IN MEMORIAM: GIOVANNI PICARDI, 1936-2015

Giovanni Picardi, Professor Emeritus at the "La Sapienza" University 
in Rome, Italy, passed away on August 17, 2015, at the age of 78 years. 
All who have had the privilege to share his scientific and professional 
commitments knew Giovanni as "the Prof". After graduating in electrical 
engineering in 1960, he taught cybernetics and information theory at 
the University of Perugia. He became professor at "La Sapienza" in 
1975, where he worked until his death - Working with both the Italian 
Space Agency and the European Space Agency as member of the science 
team of many missions. Professor Picardi played a pivotal role for all 
radars developed be the Italian Space Agency since the X-SAR program 
in 1994. He also played a leading role for the orbital radars on the 
Mars Express, Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter and Cassini planetary 
missions. His talent and steadfast commitment led to a number of 
innovative radar systems that can study the surface and subsurface of 
worlds such as Mars and Titan; as well as systems for the advanced 
and innovative Italian COSMO-SkyMed X-Band radar system for Earth 
observations.

JOB OPENINGS AT SPACE TELESCOPE SCIENCE INSTITUTE

https://rn11.ultipro.com/SPA1004/JobBoard/JobDetails.aspx?__ID
=*2357526FC6D627A1

The Space Telescope Science Institute (STScI) has multiple openings 
(ranging from entry level to highly experienced) for Analysts and 
Scientists in our Instruments and Operations and Engineering 
Divisions. Research and Instrument Analysts (RIAs) will assist 
Instrument Scientists in the operational and developmental support 
for Hubble Space Telescope, James Webb Space Telescope, and Wide-Field 
InfraRed Survey Telescope missions. Science Operations Analysts 
support science planning and scheduling operations for the Hubble 
Space Telescope and testing of the James Webb Space Telescope science 
planning and scheduling ground system. Archive Analysts are responsible 
for processing and archiving science and engineering data from the 
Hubble Space Telescope, the Kepler spacecraft and soon the James Webb 
Space Telescope. Archive Scientists provide scientific, technical, 
computational expertise and support in the areas of archive operations, 
data processing operations, archival research, and problem 
investigation and analysis.

A WORKSHOP FOR EARLY-CAREER ASTRONOMERS WHO WANT TO DO BETTER OUTREACH

(Sunday and Monday Jan 3 & 4, 2016 just before the Orlando, Florida 
American Astronomical Society Meeting)

The AAS is sponsoring a workshop -- and an ongoing community -- to 
support early-career astronomers (graduate students, post-docs, 
recent faculty) in doing effective outreach to schools, families, 
and the public. The AAS Astronomy Ambassadors program (now in its 
fourth year) offers two days of hands-on training, extensive 
resources and pre-tested activities, and a like-minded group of 
peers. If you are a young astronomer with an interest in spending a 
fraction of your time helping students or the public become more 
scientifically literate, this is an invitation to join the growing 
Ambassadors community. There is no registration fee.

Applications are due by no later than Oct. 19, 2015.  
For more about the program, see:

NASA POSTDOCTORAL FELLOWSHIPS

The NASA Postdoctoral Program (NPP) provides opportunities for 
scientists and engineers to conduct research largely of their own 
choosing, yet compatible with the research opportunities posted on 
the NPP Web site.
 
Selected by a competitive peer-review process, NPP Fellows complete 
one- to three-year Fellowship appointments that advance NASA's 
missions in Earth science, heliophysics, astrophysics, planetary 
science, astrobiology, space bioscience, aeronautics and engineering, 
human exploration and operations, and space technology.

An sample research opportunities is:

https://apps.orau.gov/NPDoc/Catalog/18624

Applicants must have a Ph.D. or equivalent degree in hand before 
beginning the fellowship, but may apply while completing the degree 
requirements. U. S. citizens, Lawful Permanent Residents, and 
foreign nationals eligible for J-1 status as a Research Scholar 
may apply.

Stipends start at $53,500 per year, with supplements for high 
cost-of-living areas and for certain academic specialties. Financial 
assistance is available for relocation and health insurance, and 
$8,000 per year is provided for professional travel.

Applications are accepted three times each year: March 1, July 1, 
and November 1.

EPSC PUBLIC WORKSHOP - AIDA: ASTEROID DEFLECTION AND ASSESSMENT 
STUDY MISSION UNDER STUDY AT ESA AND NASA

Location: Room Mars, La Cite des Congres, Nantes, France 
Date/date: Tue, 29 Sep, 2015, 17:45-19:15

This session is open to the community and will present the status of 
the Asteroid Impact Mission under Phase A/B1 study at ESA and the DART 
mission under study at NASA/APL. Both components are part of the AIDA 
mission that aims at performing a test of deflection of the small 
secondary of the asteroid binary Didymos and various technological 
demonstrations (including the deployment of a lander and cubesats, 
and optical telecommunication systems). The session will include 
45 mn of scientific and technical presentations and 45 mn will be 
devoted to questions and comments from the interested communities.

2nd ASTEROID IMPACT DEFLECTION ASSESSMENT (AIDA) INTERNATIONAL 
WORKSHOP 2016

June 1-3, 2016, Nice, France

AIDA is a technology demonstration of the kinetic impactor concept. 
It is composed of the AIM  (Asteroid Impact Mission) and the DART 
(Double Asteroid Redirection Test) spacecrafts, each under study at 
ESA and NASA, for target characterization (AIM) and impact (DART) in 
2022. The combination of both spacecrafts is referred to as AIDA.

The workshop offers a forum for the community to keep abreast with 
the advances of the AIM and DART studies. As such these two concepts 
will be presented, in terms of design, payloads and objectives, 
followed by presentations and discussions related to the science and 
planetary defense aspects of AIDA. These will include the current 
knowledge of the Didymos binary Near-Earth asteroid, the target of 
AIDA, and a more general discussion on binary systems, regolith 
characteristics and mechanics, internal structures of asteroids, 
impact observing strategies, additional science opportunities during 
an impact demonstration and associated payloads, impact modeling and 
momentum transfer of an artificial projectile, ejecta dynamics, etc.

Speakers will be solicited with ample time for discussions and working 
sessions.

More details will be provided in early 2016:
