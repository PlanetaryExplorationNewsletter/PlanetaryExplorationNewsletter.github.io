[NASA] CHANGES TO THE ROSES-15 SUMMARY OF SOLICITATION

A number of corrections and clarifications have been made to the 
ROSES-15 Summary of Solicitation. 

In response to comments from proposing organizations, the ROSES-2015 
Summary of Solicitation has been modified in a few ways. First, award 
dollar values are no longer required for the current and pending 
support section. Second, we have clarified the rules about the order 
of components of the Scientific/Technical section of the proposal, as 
well as the location of the Table of Personnel and Work Effort. 
Finally, new program elements previously added to ROSES via amendments 
now appear in the list of appendices.

A more detailed description of these changes and comparisons to what 
appears in the guidebook for proposers appears at: 

http://nasascience.nasa.gov/researchers/sara/grant-solicitations/
roses-2015

Proposers should also read the ROSES-2015 Summary of Solicitation.

NASA POSTDOCTORAL FELLOWSHIPS

The NASA Postdoctoral Program (NPP) provides opportunities for 
scientists and engineers to conduct research largely of their own 
choosing, yet compatible with the research opportunities posted on 
the NPP Web site.

Selected by a competitive peer-review process, NPP Fellows complete 
one- to three-year Fellowship appointments that advance NASA's 
missions in Earth science, heliophysics, astrophysics, planetary 
science, astrobiology, space bioscience, aeronautics and engineering, 
human exploration and operations, and space technology.

A sample research opportunity is:

https://www3.orau.gov/NPDoc/Catalog/18395

Applicants must have a Ph.D. or equivalent degree in hand before 
beginning the fellowship, but may apply while completing the degree 
requirements. U. S. citizens, Lawful Permanent Residents, and foreign 
nationals eligible for J-1 status as a Research Scholar may apply.

Stipends start at $53,500 per year, with supplements for high cost-of-
living areas and for certain academic specialties. Financial 
assistance is available for relocation and health insurance, and 
$8,000 per year is provided for professional travel.

Applications are accepted three times each year: March 1, July 1, 
and November 1.

POLARIMETRY OF STARS AND PLANETARY SYSTEMS

Cambridge University Press is pleased to announce the publication 
of "Polarimetry of Stars and Planetary Systems" edited by Ludmilla 
Kolokolova, James Hough and Anny-Chantal Levasseur-Regourd. 
Summarising the striking advances of the last two decades, this 
introduction to astronomical polarimetry provides a comprehensive 
review of state-of-the-art techniques, models and research methods. 
Focusing on optical and near-infrared wavelengths, each chapter 
addresses a different facet of recent innovations, including new 
instrumentation, techniques and theories; new methods based on 
laboratory studies, enabling the modeling of polarimetric 
characteristics for a wide variety of objects; and emerging fields 
of polarimetric exploration, including protoplanetary and debris 
disks, icy satellites, TNOs, exoplanets, and astrobiological 
applications. With contributions from an international team of 
accomplished researchers, this is an ideal resource for researchers 
working in astrophysics, earth and planetary sciences, and remote 
sensing keen to learn more about this valuable diagnostic tool. 
The book is dedicated to the memory of renowned polarimetrist Tom 
Gehrels.
