[NASA] ROSES-15 REVISED TEXT FOR THE PLANETARY EARLY CAREER FELLOWSHIP 
PROGRAM

The Early Career Fellowship (ECF) program supports the development of 
individual research programs of outstanding scientists early in their 
careers and stimulates research careers in the areas supported by the 
Planetary Sciences Division. This program is based on the idea that 
supporting key individuals is a critical mechanism for achieving high 
impact science that will lead the field forward with new concepts, 
technologies, and methods. 

This program consists of two components with two different submission 
procedures: 

(1) A one-page application to be an "Early Career Fellow" (ECF) 

(2) The subsequent submission of a seven-page proposal for start-up 
funds by a previously selected ECF. Section 2 presents details on the 
former, the application to be an ECF. Section 3 presents details on 
the latter, the proposal in response to this program element by 
selected ECFs to apply for up to $100K in start-up funds, once 
they obtain a permanent track position, which is defined in 
Section 4.3. See Section 3 for eligibility to apply for start up 
funds.

COSPAR 2016

Istanbul, 30 July - 7 August 2016

C2.2: Wave Coupling Processes and Consequences in the Whole Atmosphere
Main Scientific Organizer: Erdal Yigit (George Mason University, USA)
Deputy Organizer: Jens Oberheide (Clemson University, USA)

Description:
This symposium focuses on troposphere to thermosphere-ionosphere 
multi-scale wave coupling. New measurements, computational modeling and 
theoretical results, and analysis techniques are encouraged, including 
electrodynamical and chemical studies. In particular, studies in the 
following areas are most welcome:

1. Global structure, variability, and sources of gravity waves, 
   planetary waves, Kelvin waves, and tides.  
2. Secondary wave generation, propagation, and their effects on the 
   neutral and ionized atmosphere. 
3. Ion-neutral coupling processes in the atmosphere-ionosphere.  
4. Ionosphere-thermosphere-mesosphere response to lower and middle
   atmosphere variability.

This symposium is also an open forum for ROSMIC (Role of the Sun and 
the Middle Atmosphere/Thermosphere/Ionosphere in Climate) related 
activities and contributions.

Organizing Committee:
Deniz Demirhan Bari, William Ward, Michael J. Taylor, Jiyao Xu,
Takuji Nakamura, and Paulo P. Batista

PLANETARY GEOMORPHOLOGY EGU 2016 - DECEMBER 1ST STUDENT TRAVEL SUPPORT 
DEADLINE 

Students - the deadline for financial support applications is fast 
approaching - 1st December! To qualify you must submit your abstract 
by this date!

http://egu2016.eu/support_and_destinction.html

Planetary Geomorphology at EGU 2015 (Vienna Austria 17-22 April 2016)  
GM7.1/PS9.3

The Planetary Geomorphology session welcomes abstracts concerning 
landforms and the processes that shape them on all solar system bodies. 
Earth analogue studies, flume/simulation work and novel approaches 
using remote sensing data are especially encouraged. This session 
has always provided a stimulating forum for cross-disciplinary 
discussion and we hope you'll join us once again to bring geomorphology 
and planetary science closer together. The final deadline for abstracts 
is 13th January 2016.

UPSTAIRS DOWNSTAIRS: CONSEQUENCES OF INTERNAL PLANET EVOLUTION FOR 
THE HABITABILITY AND DETECTABILITY OF LIFE ON EXTRASOLAR PLANETS

A Workshop Without Walls Presented by the NAI, NExSS, and NSF

Where: Arizona State University & Virtual Locations
Date: February 17th-19th, 2016
Time: 9:00AM-5:00PM MST

The chemistry and physics of planetary interiors shapes conditions 
at their surfaces in ways that profoundly affect habitability and 
our ability to detect life. The nature and extent of these interactions 
are not well understood even on Earth. This workshop will bring 
together astrobiologists, astronomers, planetary scientists, 
geochemists, geophysicists, and others needed to develop a working 
theory about the complex relationships between the surface 
habitability and internal evolution of Earth and Earth-like worlds.
