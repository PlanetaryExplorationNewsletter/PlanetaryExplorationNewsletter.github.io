NEW REFEREED JOURNAL OF ASTRONOMY AND EARTH SCIENCES EDUCATION INVITES 
MANUSCRIPTS
 
The editor and editorial board are pleased to announce the publication 
of a new on-line journal for research papers on space science and 
earth science education. Entitled The Journal of Astronomy and Earth 
Sciences Education (JAESE), the new peer-reviewed publication is open-
access, meaning it is free to all readers. The first issue is already 
complete; see:

http://www.jaese.org

and papers are now being accepted for the second issue. The journal 
fills a void created when the American Astronomical Society stopped 
publishing its on-line journal, Astronomy Education Review, in 2013.

While the publication fees should not be a barrier for most authors, 
some people may have very limited budgets. For 2015, a fund has been 
established by donations to the Astronomical Society of the Pacific, 
the Wyoming Excellence in Higher Education Endowment, and the CAPER 
Center for Astronomy & Physics Education Research to subsidize 
publication costs for authors with demonstrated need. Details about 
how to apply are available from the Editor.
 
Detailed author guidelines are available at the journal website. 
Questions may be directed to the editor, Dr. Tim Slater (University 
of Wyoming) at: JAESE@uwyo.edu

PLUTO NAMING OPPORTUNITY
 
On July 14, NASA's New Horizons spacecraft will fly past Pluto, and we 
will map that distant world and its moons for the first time. Working 
with the International Astronomical Union (IAU), the New Horizons team 
plans to assign names to the features on the maps of Pluto and its 
large moon Charon, once we have seen them in sharp detail this summer. 
At the “Our Pluto” website you can suggest your ideas for names and 
vote for your favorites. The team will use your best ideas in their 
proposal to the IAU.
 
This is an opportunity for the students, teachers and the public to 
vote on names for the features on Pluto and Charon. The public input 
will be provided to the IAU, which ultimately determines the official 
scientific names for astronomical objects.

EPSC CALL FOR ABSTRACTS

Dear Colleagues,

The abstract submission for the European Planetary Science Congress, 
organized 27 September – 02 October 2015 in Nantes, France, is open, 
and the deadline for abstracts is 29 April 2015.

We invite you to submit abstracts to our (co-organized) session 
GP2/TP11/EX7 "Aerosols and clouds in planetary atmospheres" organized 
this year for the first time!

http://meetingorganizer.copernicus.org/EPSC2015/session/19663

Atmospheric aerosols and cloud particles are found in every atmosphere 
of the solar system, as well as, in exoplanets. Depending on their 
size, shape, chemical composition, latent heat, and distribution, 
their effect on the radiation budget varies drastically and is 
difficult to predict. When organic, aerosols also carry a strong 
prebiotic interest reinforced by the presence of heavy atoms such as 
nitrogen, oxygen or sulfur.

The aim of the session is to gather presentations on these complex 
objects for both terrestrial and giant planet atmospheres, including 
the special case of Titan’s hazy atmosphere. All research aspects from 
their production and evolution processes, their observation/detection, 
to their fate and atmospheric impact are welcomed, including 
laboratory investigations and modeling.

Spread the word, and see you in Nantes!

With best regards,
The conveners Nathalie Carrasco, Panayotis Lavvas, Anni Määttänen

DPS HAS PARTNERED WITH MENTORNET

Members of the planetary science community are invited to participate 
in the acclaimed e-mentoring program MentorNet. Both mentors and 
mentees (protégés) can take advantage of this program, which provides 
a detailed matching algorithm, and guides for getting the most out of 
a mentoring relationship. This is an opportunity to participate in 
professional development activities with other DPS members throughout 
the year. The program is very flexible, mentors and protégés always 
have options when being paired, and they mutually decide on the 
frequency of communication during the recommended four month mentoring 
cycle (with the option to renew or select a new mentor/mentee at the 
end of the cycle). 

We are seeking both mentors and protégés to sign up in spring 2015.  
At this point in time we particularly need mentors! Anyone can be a 
mentor or a protégé at any stage of their career. To create a profile 
and select “Division of Planetary Sciences” as your affiliation 
(even if you are not an official member), visit:

http://MentorNet.net 

The required online training takes ~30 minutes, but can be done in 
sections. This assures that mentors and protégés start off with 
similar expectations about the mentoring relationship. 

Contact Kelsi Singer (ksinger@boulder.swri.edu) or Karly Pitman 
(pitman@spacescience.org) with questions or for more info.​
