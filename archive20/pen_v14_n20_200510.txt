UPDATE: 2020 IN SITU SCIENCE AND INSTRUMENTATION WORKSHOP FOR THE
EXPLORATION OF EUROPA AND OCEAN WORLDS

Due to the current situation, the 2020 In Situ Science and
Instrumentation Workshop for the Exploration of Europa and Ocean Worlds
has been postponed to a later date. On May 14, 2020 the Europa Lander
pre-project team will host a virtual presentation from 10 AM - 12 PM
Pacific. This Webex presentation will cover much of the Europa Lander
mission concept overview material, and updates on several of the
technology development efforts that have been ongoing, along with an
interactive feature to allow for questions from attendees.

Everyone who had registered for the in-person workshop remains on our
mailing list and will be sent the Webex virtual meeting info. If you
did not register for the workshop, but are interested in participating
in this remote meeting, please email us at
Europainsitu.workshop@jpl.nasa.gov to get a link to be added to our
mailing list.

NEW MERCURY EXPLORATION ASSESSMENT GROUP (MEXAG) - CALL FOR STEERING
COMMITTEE NOMINATIONS

The NASA Planetary Science Division (PSD) is pleased to announce the
formation of a new Mercury Exploration Assessment Group (MExAG). This
community-based, interdisciplinary body will provide science input and
analysis needed to plan and prioritize Mercury research and exploration
activities. Membership of MExAG, and participation in its activities,
is open to all members of the planetary science and exploration
community who are interested in the exploration of Mercury.

MExAG is now accepting nominations for its initial Steering Committee.
See the MExAG website for full information:

https://www.lpi.usra.edu/mexag/

Nominations will close at 11:59pm (EDT) on May 27, 2020 so that the 
Steering Committee can be in place before the Planetary Science and 
Astrobiology Decadal Survey White Paper submission deadline.

Steven A. Hauck, II (Case Western Reserve University)
Chair, MExAG

POSTDOCTORAL OR GUEST SCIENTIST POSITIONS IN SPACE PHYSICS

Swedish Institute of Space Physics (IRF) invited applications for
positions in the field of space plasma physics. The topics of the
respective positions:

- Investigation of electron dynamics in a cometary ionosphere. The work
involves analysis of Rosetta data at comet 67P.
- Particle energization by collisionless shocks at electron scales. The
work involves analysis of data from Magnetospheric Multiscale mission
at the Earth's bow shock.

Our team performs observations, data analysis and modelling of space
plasma processes. The team has decades of experience in developing and
operating instruments to measure electric fields, plasma temperature,
density and density fluctuations for spacecraft missions.

The positions are available at IRF's Uppsala office (Angstrom
Laboratory). Funded by grants from the Swedish National Space Agency
for 2 years.

Applications: registrator@irf.se
Reference number: 2.2.1-137/20
Closing date: 31 May 2020
