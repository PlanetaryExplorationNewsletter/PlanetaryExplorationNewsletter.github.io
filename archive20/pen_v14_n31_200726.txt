IN MEMORIUM: MICHAEL MISHCHENKO (1959-2020)

It is with great sadness that we announce the passing of our colleague
Michael I. Mishchenko. Dr. Michael Mishchenko was a graduate of the
Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology and received his PhD (with
honors) and Habilitation Doctoral degrees in physics from the National
Academy of Sciences of Ukraine (NASU). He worked at the Main
Astronomical Observatory in Kiev (1987-1992) and then joined the
research staff of the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies in New
York. Michael's research interests included electromagnetic scattering
by morphologically complex particles and particle groups, polarimetry,
aerosol and cloud remote sensing, and ocean optics.

NEW FREE RESOURCE GUIDE ON "BLACK LIVES IN ASTRONOMY"

"Black Lives in Astronomy," a new 8-page resource guide by
astronomer/educator Andrew Fraknoi, includes written and video
resources about and by 25 black astronomers, as well as general
materials to examine the history and issues facing black members of the
astronomical community. Both older, established scientists and people
early in their careers are covered. It is aimed at the Astro 101 and
amateur astronomer level, and thus does not include any technical
materials. It is designed to give instructors and students examples of
authentic black voices that can be shown in class or used in
assignments. You can find it free of charge at:

[NASA] ROSES-20: PAYLOADS AND RESEARCH INVESTIGATIONS ON THE SURFACE OF
THE MOON (PRISM)
 
The PRISM call will seek investigations that address the science goals
of 1) any SMD division, e.g., Planetary Science, Earth Science,
Heliophysics, Astrophysics, Biological and Physical Sciences, formerly
a Division in the Human Exploration and Operations Mission Directorate
known as Space Life and Physical Sciences Research and Applications; 2)
Strategic Knowledge Gaps of the HEOMD; or 3) any technology
demonstration goals of the Space Technology Mission Directorate (STMD)
that advance capabilities for science, exploration, or commercial
development of the Moon. PRISM science investigations must address
NASA's science objectives as described in 2018 NASA Strategic Plan, the
relevant division Decadal Surveys, and/or the 2019 NASA Science
Strategy of the Moon. Also of relevance are those objectives outlined
in the Planetary Science Decadal (Vision and Voyages for Planetary
Science in the Decade 2013-2022), the Scientific Context for
Exploration of the Moon, and the Advancing Science of the Moon Specific
Action Team.

[NASA] PDS: LUNAR RECONNAISSANCE ORBITER NEW DIVINER PCP PRODUCT

New Diviner Polar Cumulative Products (PCP) are available.
Nadir-pointing RDR data from July, 5, 2009 to Feb 17, 2019 has been
compiled at a resolution of 240 m/pix into polar stereographic maps of
temperatures poleward of 80 degrees latitude at fixed local times and
fixed subsolar longitudes to provide an overview of diurnal
temperatures of the polar regions. The data have been divided into
winter and summer seasons, defined by the times of year when the
subsolar latitude is above or below the equator, to characterize the
variations in seasonal temperatures that result from the 1.54 degree
angle between the Moon's spin pole and the ecliptic plane. Details can
be found in Williams, J.-P., B. T. Greenhagen, D. A. Paige, N.

AGU SESSION EP016: EXTRATERRESTRIAL SURFACE PROCESSES UNDER ALIEN
BOUNDARY CONDITIONS

Quantitative surface process models derived for Earth systems are
commonly applied to other planetary bodies, providing critical insights
into the geologic history of the Solar System. In return, the diverse
planetary surfaces across the Solar System offer opportunities to test
these models under conditions that are often unachievable on Earth or
in the laboratory. We invite contributions in the field of planetary
surface processes that use planetary analogs, laboratory experiments,
theoretical and numerical modeling, and planetary-exploration data from
robotic spacecraft. This session's goal is to explore the interplays
between quantitative models of planetary surface processes and the
challenges imposed on these models by new planetary data. We intend for
this session to foster more collaboration between members of the PS and
EPSP sections.

AGU SESSION P023: MERCURY - FROM MESSENGER TO BEPICOLOMBO

With the abstract deadline for 2020 AGU Fall Meeting now only days
away, we invite you to submit an abstract to the Mercury session.

NASA's MESSENGER mission revolutionized our understanding of Mercury's
surface, interior, exosphere, magnetosphere, and heliospheric
environment. With the launch to Mercury of the ESA/JAXA BepiColombo
dual spacecraft mission to Mercury in October 2018, that understanding
is poised to soon take another major step forward. In this session, we
welcome contributions on data analysis, laboratory measurements,
ground-based observations, and theoretical developments that build on
the current state of knowledge of Mercury. We particularly welcome
papers on how questions raised by MESSENGER findings can be addressed
by future observations expected from BepiColombo, as well as how
measurements by BepiColombo during flybys of Earth and Venus in 2020
can be used to support investigations at Mercury.

AGU SESSION P029: PLANETARY ATMOSPHERES AND EVOLUTION

Conveners: Feng Tian (CU Boulder), Vladimir Airapetian (NASA/GSFC &
American University, DC, Dedric Gillmann (Royal Observatory of
Belgium), Yasuhito Sekine (ELSI)

We invite oral and poster contributions to advance our understanding
of the nature and evolution of (exoplanetary) atmospheres and its
impact on habitability.

Understanding the nature and variability of (exo)planetary atmospheres,
the physical mechanisms governing these atmospheres, and their chemical
evolution are strong driving forces of planetary science and solar
system exploration mission planning. While the long-term evolution of
the Earth is constrained by geological studies and isotopic analyses,
the evolutionary paths of other planets must be reconstructed from data
obtained through astronomical observations and planetary missions.
Models of planetary atmospheres use these observations to illuminate
governing physical processes operating from the Earth to other planets
in our Solar System and beyond. The rapidly increasing number of
discovered exoplanets provides a new opportunity for interdisciplinary
collaborations between heliophysicists, astrophysicists, geoscientists,
biochemists, planetary and climate scientists concerning the physical
and chemical evolution of (exo)planetary atmospheres and planetary
habitability. This session welcomes observational, theoretical,
experimental, and field studies relevant to the atmospheres, evolution,
and habitability of planets in and outside of our Solar System.

AGU SESSION P039: SURFACE PROCESSES ON ACTIVE ICY WORLDS

We invite you to submit an abstract to our AGU session P039: Surface
Processes on Active Icy Worlds. This session focuses on the surfaces
of outer Solar System bodies. The extreme conditions and exotic
materials on the surfaces of outer Solar System bodies - such as the
icy satellites, small bodies, and Kuiper Belt Objects - result in
unique surface processes not commonly observed on rocky terrestrial
planets. We invite members of the community to submit abstracts
covering the range of surface processes from the grain to landscape
scale, and including remote sensing, laboratory and terrestrial
analogs, instrumentation and experiments, and theoretical and numerical
modelling.

AGU SESSION P044: THE STRATOSPHERIC OBSERVATORY FOR INFRARED ASTRONOMY
(SOFIA) - AN ASSET FOR PLANETARY SCIENCE

We invite the community to consider submitting an abstract to the
following session at the 2020 AGU Fall meeting:

The instrument suite onboard the Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared
Astronomy (SOFIA) provides unique access to the infrared sky (4-600
microns) for planetary scientists. This wavelength range is
particularly relevant to solid surfaces studies, as it contains
signature bands of mineral groups and organics, observed for example on
asteroids Ceres and Hygiea. SOFIA provides unique diagnostics of
crystalline/ amorphous composition, and of cometary dust grain size
distribution. In addition, its high spectral resolution allows one to
measure abundances of molecular species in planetary and cometary
atmospheres, including the D/H ratio in water (Mars, comet Wirtanen).
Finally, with the ability to deploy anywhere on Earth, SOFIA has been a
key resource in occultations observing campaigns (Pluto, Triton,
Varda,...). This session welcomes highlights of the latest SOFIA Solar
System results. It will include a Q&A on the role of SOFIA for the
planetary community, and an update on observatory status. 

Abstract submission deadline: July 29, 2020
