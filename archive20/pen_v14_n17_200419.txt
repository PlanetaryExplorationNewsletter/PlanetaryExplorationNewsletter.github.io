[NASA] PDS: MRO SHARAD BACKLOGGED RDR DATASET RELEASE, 47-49

MRO SHARAD derived data from the ASI (Italian Space Agency) SHARAD
Ground Operations Center have been released covering the period
April 21-October 15, 2018. These time periods correspond to previous
MRO releases 48-49, plus some missing data from release 47. Data are
available here:

http://pds-geosciences.wustl.edu/missions/mro/sharad.htm

The SHARAD team is recovering data from deliveries that were missed due
to a hiatus in ground operations between June 2012 and March 2013. For
details, see the file ERRATA.TXT on the archive volume at:

PLANETARY EXPLORATION BUDGET DATASET RELEASE

The Planetary Society is pleased to release the planetary exploration
budget dataset - the most comprehensive public reference of NASA's
investments in robotic planetary exploration to date.
The dataset includes the following unique features:

- Total amounts (as proposed and actually spent) on NASA's planetary
  science program since fiscal year 1959, including refined inflation
  adjustments using NASA's New Start Index.
- Complete spending profiles for every SMD-directed planetary mission
  and every major planetary program (Mariner, Discovery, New
  Frontiers, etc.), broken down by development, operations, and 
  launch costs, where possible.
- Congressionally enacted amounts for major planetary projects for
  all fiscal years after 2000, where specified.
- Raw data and program structure for nearly every planetary budget
  request since fiscal year 1959.

The data is being made available for free, to anyone. To access, and to
see additional discussion on methods, data normalization, and context,

EXTENDED DEADLINE FOR SESSION PROPOSALS, WORKSHOPS, TOWN HALLS, AGU 
FALL MEETING

Just a reminder that the deadline for sessions, workshops, town halls, 
and innovative sessions for the 2020 AGU Fall Meeting (7-11 December in 
San Francisco) has been extended until Thursday, 23 April. So far we have 
received very few session proposals to Planetary Sciences.

I know we are all challenged by the current COVID-19 crisis, but I
wanted to encourage you to propose your favorite session for this
meeting.  Even if it ends up as a totally virtual meeting, it can help
make up for the cancelled spring 2020 meetings. Stay safe everyone, and
make your session proposals here:

OPENPLANETARY VIRTUAL CONFERENCE

OpenPlanetary will host a virtual planetary science conference from
June 22-24. The conference will consist of lecture-length talks from
invited speakers, coffee break / networking opportunities, workshops
and tutorials, and a hackathon. The conference will have no
registration fee, but registration will be required to participate. A
schedule and website, with information on how to register, will be
announced in the coming weeks.

Contact chase@openplanetary.org with questions.

SAVE THE DATE - TESS SCIENCE CONFERENCE II

The second TESS Science Conference will take place on August 2-6
(Mon-Fri), 2021, at the Kresge Auditorium on MIT campus (Cambridge, MA,
USA). The conference is timed at the beginning of the 2nd year of the
TESS Extended Mission, and 4th year overall. The conference will cover
all science done with TESS data, from Solar System, through exoplanets
and stellar astrophysics, to extragalactic astronomy. The conference
will focus on all aspects of the mission: TESS data analysis techniques
developed by the community, follow-up observations, and how discoveries
made with TESS data impact theoretical understanding. Later this year
we will send a detailed announcement with information about 
registration and accommodation options. Please direct any questions to:
tsc2@mit.edu.

SSFA SUMMER SCHOOL

Please note that the Summer School in Software Systems for Astronomy 
(SSfA-7) will be offered online this year, and will be spread over 7 
weeks, 22-Jun to 31-Jul, 2020.  The course covers software design and 
implementation of telescope and instrument control systems, observation
planning tools, and software for analyzing and archiving astronomical 
data.

If you are not a University of Hawaii at Hilo (UHH) student, use this
link to be admitted for the summer:

RESEARCH SCIENTIST II AT THE JET PROPULSION LABORATORY

The Jet Propulsion Laboratory invites applications for a Scientist to 
bring new expertise and ensure continuity of existing capabilities at 
JPL. The successful candidate will develop an independently funded 
research program, provide scientific leadership and support research 
conducted within the laboratory studies group. The candidate will 
publish in peer reviewed scientific journals, and present papers at 
scientific conferences. 

Qualifications:
- Ph.D. degree in experimental chemistry or physics.
- Demonstrated working knowledge at the forefront of experimental 
  laboratory studies with direct planetary science applications (i.e, 
  relevance to icy moons, Kuiper Belt Objects, dwarf planets, 
  asteroids, comets, and Solar System evolution).
- Demonstrated experience with a range of relevant experimental 
  techniques (e.g., matrix isolation, UV an IR spectroscopy, mass 
  spectroscopy, temperature programmed desorption) and apparatus 
  (e.g., cryogenic systems, UHV systems).
- Demonstrated reputation as a productive researcher with a track 
  record of publications in peer-reviewed journals. 
	
Preferred qualifications:
- 3-5 years of related post-doc experience.
- History of writing successful external research funding proposals.
- Demonstrated working knowledge of planning, execution, and analysis 
  of astronomical observations.
