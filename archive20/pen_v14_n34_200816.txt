[NASA] ROSES-20: REVISED TEXT AND DELAY OF DUE DATE FOR PLANETARY
SCIENCE EARLY CAREER AWARD PROGRAM

Program Element C.19 of ROSES-2020, the Planetary Science Early Career
Award (ECA) Program supports the professional development of
outstanding early-career scientists in areas relevant to the Planetary
Science Division.

The text of this program element has been revised in many ways, so
please read the text carefully. The due date for proposals has been
delayed to December 8, 2020.

This Amendment will be posted on the NASA research opportunity homepage
at:

https://nspires.nasaprs.com/external/solicitations/summary.do?solId=%7bABEB3467-5FFB-D481-4DEE-1FB5B9B87B7E%7d&path=&method=init

and will appear on SARA's ROSES blog at:

https://science.nasa.gov/researchers/sara/grant-solicitations/roses-2020/

Questions concerning the Planetary Science Early Career Award Program
may be directed to Melissa Morris at melissa.a.morris@nasa.gov.

SUBMISSIONS OPEN FOR THE ART OF PLANETARY SCIENCE 2020: A VIRTUAL
ODYSSEY

Currently in the 7th annual exhibition, The Art of Planetary Science
brings together Data Art and Fine Art from space and planetary themed
ideas. This year's show, due to the novel coronavirus (COVID-19), will
be held in an entirely online format. We present to you, The Art of
Planetary Science 2020: A Virtual Odyssey.

Submissions are now open for The Art of Planetary Science 2020: A
Virtual Odyssey. This year, we are partnered with International Observe
the Moon Night and will be hosting a special sub-gallery of moon-themed
art as a result.

The submission form, as well as detailed information is located on our
website. Submissions are open until August 31, 2020.

INVITATION TO WEBINAR FEATURING LENNARD FISK: VOYAGERS 1 AND 2 - WHERE
ARE WE NOW?

Please join the Interstellar Probe Study Team for another installment
of the Interstellar Probe Study Webinar series on Thursday August 20 at
noon EDT via Zoom.
 
Title:
Voyagers 1 and 2: Where are we now?
 
Panelists:
Lennard Fisk: Thomas M. Donahue Distinguished University Professor of
Space Science
Michael Paul: Program Manager, Interstellar Probe Study, JHUAPL
 
The current interpretations of the Voyager data on the heliosheath and
the interface with the local interstellar medium are reviewed, and
serious omissions in these interpretations are pointed out. Current
conclusions on the global structure of the heliosheath, whether from
models or observations, are found to be wanting, resulting in a need
for better models and further observations, such as by Interstellar
Probe.

Following the presentations there will be a question and answer
session.

To watch this webinar please visit the following event page, which has
the zoom link.

AAS VIDEOS ON TEACHING ON-LINE 

The American Astronomical Society has put together a series of short
YouTube videos on aspects of "Teaching On-Line," with Frank Timmes as
the genial host. Chris Impey did the first 12 programs, on a wide range
of practical topics illuminating the process of moving your class
on-line. The most recent two videos were by Andrew Fraknoi: one on the
non-profit OpenStax project to create free, on-line introductory
textbooks, and the other on interdisciplinary approaches to astronomy
teaching (using astronomy-inspired music, science fiction, plays, and
products in your classes.) 

The series is at:

[NASA] DUE DATE REMINDER & FINAL FAQS FOR SMD'S AUGMENTATIONS AND 
FUNDED EXTENSIONS - EXPRESSION OF INTEREST

Solicitation Number: NNH20ZDA010L
Additional FAQ Release Date: August 13, 2020
Response Date: August 21, 2020
 
The Science Mission Directorate (SMD) has added 6 new Frequently Asked
Questions and Answers (FAQS) for Expression of Interest (EOI) SMD
call for Augmentations and Funded Extensions on the NASA Solicitation
and Proposal Integrated Review and Evaluation System (NSPIRES). EOIs
are due by 11:59 p.m. Eastern on August 21, 2020 via NSPIRES:

https://bit.ly/31UTfW7
 
SMD will not provide any feedback on EOI submissions. NASA SMD will
keep EOI contents confidential and will use responses to improve
management of the augmentation and extension processes. NSPIRES will
post no additional EOI questions and answers. An EOI submission is not
required nor will it limit the submission of a future proposal, for a
grant, contract, cooperative agreement, or inter-agency transfer
agreement, whether inside or outside NASA.

A forthcoming amendment adding a new program element to ROSES-2020 is
expected to be entitled "SMD Post-COVID Recovery". SMD expects all its
science divisions, including the Biological and Physical Sciences, to
participate in this cross-divisional program within ROSES.

Email questions concerning general ROSES-2020 policies and procedures,
including this Expression of Interest, to sara@nasa.gov.

[NASA] PLANETARY DATA ECOSYSTEM VOLUNTEER OPPORTUNITY: SELF NOMINATIONS 
WELCOME

NASA defines the Planetary Data Ecosystem (PDE) "as the ad hoc
connected framework of activities and products that are built upon and
support the data collected by planetary space missions and research
programs, primarily those funded by NASA." The PDE includes but is not
limited to archives, tools, programs, projects, pipelines, and
stakeholder groups.

The PDE Independent Review Board (IRB) will conduct a review of the
Planetary Science Division's (PSD) PDE with the goal of defining the
full environment, identifying missing or overly redundant elements, and
providing findings and prioritized, actionable recommendations for
PSD's long-term planning in support of the PDE.

The IRB will be comprised of members from academia, industry,
Government, and the public. Member expertise will span the areas of
project management, science, engineering, and the user base. The PDE
IRB will be convened virtually over the course of three months in fall
2020 (estimate). To submit a self-nomination:

https://science.nasa.gov/researchers/volunteer-review-panels/planetary-data-ecosystem-pde-independent-review-board-irb

Signing up does not commit you to serve and does not prevent you from
submitting responses to any NASA Request for Information.
