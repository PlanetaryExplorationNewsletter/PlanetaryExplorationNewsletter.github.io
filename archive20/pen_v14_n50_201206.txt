Carrier, and Dave Beaty of the Mars Program Science Office, the
December 2020 edition of the Mars Exploration Science Monthly
Newsletter can be found on the web at:

http://mepag.jpl.nasa.gov

In this newsletter, we continue to update the upcoming conference
schedule with postponements, cancellations, and conversions to virtual
meetings.

We hope everyone remains safe and healthy within these stressful,
rapidly evolving, social-isolating times.

Please send your Mars community announcements and calendar items for
inclusion in the newsletter to Barbara at:

SPECIAL ISSUE IN FRONTIERS: INTERPLANETARY MEDIUM VARIABILITY AS
OBSERVED IN THE NEW ERA OF SPACECRAFT MISSIONS 

This Research Topic addresses the interplanetary medium variability as
observed in the new era of spacecraft missions. This Research Topic
aims to collect Original Research, Brief Research Reports,
Perspectives, Reviews, Data Reports as well Hypothesis and Theory
manuscripts on new observational findings and their theoretical
counterparts coming from both single- and multi-spacecraft
investigations that will help in advancing our understanding of the
interplanetary medium:

- Investigating scaling-law behaviors, turbulence, intermittency,
  large-scale/inertial/kinetic physics;
- Particle acceleration, shocks, waves, and dust;
- Wave-particle interactions, solar and in situ magnetic structures,
  propagation and acceleration of energetic particles;
- Solar wind - planetary coupling dynamics, localized processes (e.g.,
  reconnection and instabilities, planetary boundaries formation and
  induced phenomena), cross-scale interactions and multiscale physics. 

Please note the following submission deadlines:

ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY (RAS) SPECIALIST DISCUSSION MEETING
"COMPARATIVE EQUATORIAL THERMOSPHERE-IONOSPHERE-MAGNETOSPHERE COUPLING"

Held remotely on Friday 12 February 2021, 10:30-15:30 GMT. Abstracts 
should be submitted by the end of Tuesday 12 January 2021 at: 

https://forms.gle/oMbd4RndF5nG8x3T8

All participants will be required to register beforehand. Meeting
registration is free for RAS Fellows and 5.00 pounds for non-Fellows.

Registration links will be available at:

https://bit.ly/36OVnm2

The goal of this meeting is to bridge different planetary communities
to understand how equatorial magnetic fields link an atmosphere with
the space environment across different planetary bodies; providing us
with a comparative view of how these regions interact and the dynamics
that these interactions produce.

Specific topics may include (but are not limited to):

- Formation of the equatorial anomaly at Earth
- Localised aurora and ionospheric variations at Mars
- The azimuthal magnetic field anomalies measured inside Saturn's
  rings, and the thermospheric driver of the currents that produce them
- The variation in 'ring-rain' falling from Saturn's rings into the
  mid-latitude ionosphere
- The generation of Jupiter's Lyman-alpha bulge and its relationship
  with the localised magnetic anomalies in Jupiter's field

VEGU 2021 CALL FOR ABSTRACTS: VOLCANISM IN PLANETARY BODIES

Due to the pandemic, the next EGU General Assembly will be online only,
and it will take place between 19-30 April 2021.

Volcanism played a fundamental role on Earth influencing our atmosphere
and acting as an engine for primordial life. Similar events took place
on other planetary bodies. Many studies have investigated the nature of
volcanism on planetary bodies demonstrating that terrestrial magmatic
processes are in some ways analogous to magmatism in other planetary
bodies across the Solar System. However, our knowledge about the
process of volcanism on other planets is still limited.

The aim of this session is to bring together planetary and terrestrial
volcano scientists to bridge the gap between these two disciplines. We
welcome contributions exploring new analytical techniques, revisiting
existing extraterrestrial and terrestrial processes or proposing new
ones.

Contributions dealing with geochemistry, mineral physics,
volcano-petrology, physical volcanology, volcano-tectonism and
combining terrestrial and planetary sciences are especially encouraged.

LIFE DETECTION KNOWLEDGE BASE WORKSHOP

The Center for Life Detection (CLD) invites you to take part in an
upcoming workshop to develop a new tool for the life detection
community. The Life Detection Knowledge Base (KB) is intended as an
online repository for current knowledge about biosignatures.

Goals of this virtual workshop include:

- Introduce the research community to the KB platform 
- Teach participants how to work with and enter information into the KB
- Establish working groups for the on-going development of the KB

An anticipated outcome of the workshop is that the development of
content for entry into the KB will support the preparation of
biosignature-specific manuscripts for publication.

The workshop will commence with a plenary session in which the
organizing basis of the KB will be introduced. Subsequently, working
groups will be organized to populate the KB with content.

The plenary will take place on 19 January 2021 from 10:00-12:00 PST
(18:00-20:00 UTC), with working groups commencing the week of 25
January. A recording of the plenary will be available for those who
would like to participate but cannot attend on 19 January.

JOB DESCRIPTION: PLANETARY ASTRONOMER

The SETI Institute is seeking a Planetary Astronomer to support the
work of the Ring-Moon Systems Node (RMS) of NASA's Planetary Data
System (PDS). We seek a curious and creative individual who is eager to
work with data from diverse instruments and missions. The curation of
planetary data requires someone who is able to understand the data's
scientific importance, assess the data's validity, converse
knowledgeably with fellow scientists, and confirm that documentation
and descriptive metadata are sufficient for the needs of current and
future scientists.

The astronomer will collaborate closely with the Node Manager, Dr Matt
Tiscareno, on all aspects of RMS Node planning and task management.
They will understudy with longtime RMS Deputy Manager, Dr Mitch Gordon,
and prepare to carry on his work as he approaches retirement.

This is a full-time position with full benefits. However, the
astronomer will be encouraged to seek additional research funding on
any topic of their choosing including, but not limited to, topics
related to the Node's extensive data holdings. The position offers
substantial growth potential for applicants who are able to demonstrate
mastery of the key requirements.

NASA POSTDOCTORAL FELLOWSHIPS

The NASA Postdoctoral Program offers US and international scientists
the opportunity to advance their research while contributing to NASA's
scientific goals. The NPP supports fundamental science, promotes 
intellectual growth, and encourages scientific connections.

Selected by a competitive peer-review process, NPP Fellows complete
one- to three-year Fellowship appointments that advance NASA's missions
in earth science, heliophysics, planetary science, astrophysics, space
bioscience, aeronautics and engineering, human exploration and space
operations, and astrobiology.

Current NPP research opportunities in planetary science can be viewed
at: 

https://npp.usra.edu/opportunities/?filter_keywords=&filter_fields=145

Applicants must have a Ph.D. or equivalent degree in hand before
beginning the fellowship, but may apply while completing the degree
requirements. U.S. citizens, Lawful Permanent Residents, and foreign
nationals eligible for J-1 status as a Research Scholar may apply.

Stipends start at $60,000 per year, with supplements for high
cost-of-living areas and for certain academic specialties. Financial
assistance is available for relocation and health insurance, and
$10,000 per year is provided for professional travel.

Applications are accepted three times each year: March 1, July 1, and
November 1.
