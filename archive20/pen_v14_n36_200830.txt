IN MEMORIAM: NADINE G. BARLOW

Nadine Gail Barlow passed away on August 17, 2020.

Over 18 years at Northern Arizona University, Nadine ascended the 
academic ranks, becoming Department Chair of Astronomy and Planetary 
Science. She received numerous awards for teaching excellence. 
Doubling the size of the Department, she grew its curriculum into 
a Ph.D.-granting program. Nadine supervised many undergraduate and 
graduate students, and was a popular mentor and friend to those under 
her tutelage. A prize for Undergraduate Research Excellence is being 
established in her name. Academic outreach was a priority, bringing 
the Arizona Space Grant Program to NAU, and fostering cooperation 
between NAU, Lowell Observatory, and the USGS. Nadine specialized in 
impact cratering processes across the Solar System. Almost on a dare, 
she mapped, measured, and classified every crater on Mars larger than 
8 km in diameter for her Ph.D. dissertation. These data were used to 
establish the detailed relative chronology of Martian geologic 
features. Throughout her career, she expanded this database, as later 
spacecraft missions returned increasingly detailed images of Mars. 
The IAU named asteroid 15466 Barlow in her honor.

Nadine is missed by family and many lifelong friends.

OPENINGS ON OUTER PLANETS ANALYSIS GROUP (OPAG) STEERING COMMITTEE

Several openings are available on the OPAG steering committee to 
replace members who will be rolling off. All interested candidates are 
encouraged to apply, particularly those with expertise in Giant Planet 
Interiors, Ocean Worlds & Cryospheres (field and experimental), 
Astrobiology, and those able to represent Science Mission Directorate 
Cross-Divisional interests.

Nominations will be accepted after the OPAG virtual meeting in 
September 2020 and will be due by November 1, 2020. New members will 
start their service in time for the Spring 2021 OPAG meeting. Details 
of the nomination process include providing a one-page letter of 
interest and a two-page NASA proposal-style CV that address what 
community the candidates represent, and how they will enhance that 
community's representation on the steering committee. A New Members 
subcommittee of the OPAG Steering Committee will review all of the 
nominations and make recommendations to the full Steering Committee. 
Through the search process, we will strive to ensure representation 
across multiple axes to foster an interdisciplinary, diverse, 
equitable, inclusive, and accessible community.

[NASA] MISSION SCIENCE TEAM MEETING OPPORTUNITIES FOR EARLY CAREER 
SCIENTISTS

The Psyche, Europa Clipper, and Dragonfly missions are providing the 
opportunity for early career scientists to observe their next science 
team meetings. This opportunity is open to graduate students in or 
beyond their third year of earning their doctorate or early career 
scientists within seven years of receiving their doctorate. At this 
time the opportunity is limited to U.S. citizens and green card 
holders. Submit a letter no longer than two pages that describes your 
background and research interests, how such an experience could be of 
benefit to them, and which mission they wish to observe. Respondents 
will be selected based upon the anticipated impact to their career path 
and the alignment of the mission with their research interests. 
Selection preference will be given to individuals from institutions 
that are underrepresented on planetary science missions. NASA 
recognizes and supports the benefits of having diverse and inclusive 
communities. 

Send letters and questions to curt.niebur@nasa.gov with the subject 
line "Science Team Meeting." Those interested in observing the Europa 
Clipper mission must respond by September 14, 2020, while those 
interested in the Dragonfly or Psyche missions must respond by 
September 30, 2020.

[NASA] PLANETARY DATA ECOSYSTEM (PDE) INDEPENDENT REVIEW BOARD (IRB) 
SELF-NOMINATION CLOSING ON OR ABOUT SEPTEMBER 7

NASA defines the Planetary Data Ecosystem (PDE) "as the ad hoc 
connected framework of activities and products that are built upon and 
support the data collected by planetary space missions and research 
programs, primarily those funded by NASA." The PDE includes but is not 
limited to archives, tools, programs, projects, pipelines, and 
stakeholder groups.

The PDE Independent Review Board (IRB) will conduct a review of the 
Planetary Science Division's (PSD) PDE with the goal of defining the 
full environment, identifying missing or overly redundant elements, 
and providing findings and prioritized, actionable recommendations for 
PSD's long-term planning in support of the PDE.

The PDE IRB will be convened virtually over the course of three months 
in fall 2020 (estimate).

A third-party contractor independently will select the PDE IRB members 
and will issue any invitations to serve. It is anticipated that 
invitations to members will begin in late-August and early-September. 
To submit a self-nomination, please visit: 

https://science.nasa.gov/researchers/volunteer-review-panels/planetary-data-ecosystem-pde-independent-review-board-irb 

Signing up does not commit you to serve.

Send questions or comments to Rebecca McCauley Rench 
(becky.mccauley@nasa.gov) using subject line: PDE Self Nomination.
