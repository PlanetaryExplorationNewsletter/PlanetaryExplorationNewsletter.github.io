PLANETARY SCIENCE JOURNAL

The first articles to be published in The Planetary Science Journal 
(PSJ) are now online! Launched late last year by the American 
Astronomical Society (AAS) and its Division for Planetary Sciences 
(DPS), PSJ is an open-access journal devoted to recent developments, 
discoveries, and theories relevant to the investigation of both our 
solar system and other planetary systems. PSJ publishes manuscripts 
reporting significant new observational results, theoretical insights, 
computational modeling, laboratory experiments, innovations in 
instrumentation, and field work in the planetary sciences. Go to:

http://psj.aas.org

PSJ's Editor is Faith Vilas (Planetary Science Institute). She is 
supported by three Science Editors: Brian Jackson (Boise State 
University), Edgard G. Rivera-Valentin (Lunar and Planetary Institute, 
Universities Space Research Association), and Maria Womack (University 
of Central Florida). 

PEN will provide direct links to new PSJ articles published the
previous week in a new section of the newsletter.
