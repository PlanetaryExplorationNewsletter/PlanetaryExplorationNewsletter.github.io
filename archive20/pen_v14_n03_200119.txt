COSPAR 2020 SESSION 20-B1.3: RESULTS FROM THE EXPLORATION OF THE KUIPER 
BELT BY NASA'S NEW HORIZONS MISSION

We call your attention and invite contributed talks for the COSPAR-2020 
session on "Results from the Exploration of the Kuiper Belt by NASA's 
New Horizons Mission." Abstract submission is open through February 14. 
The 43rd COSPAR Scientific Assembly will occur August 15-22, 2020, in 
Sydney, Australia. Website: 

https://www.cospar-assembly.org 

This session will review and extend the scientific results obtained 
from the exploration of KBO 2014 MU69 (Arrokoth) by NASA's New Horizons 
mission. Topics will include the color, composition, bulk properties, 
geology and origin of MU69, including its cratering record, with the 
objective of understanding the formation of Kuiper Belt planetesimals. 
The session will also examine the loss of primordial volatiles from 
MU69, its space weathering evolution, the Kuiper Belt radiation and 
dust environment, and observations of dwarf planets and other KBOs to 
assess satellite populations, phase curves, rotational lightcurves, and 
shapes, and to otherwise place MU69 in context.

[NASA] ROSES-19: NEW MANDATORY NOI DATE AND DOCUMENTS FOR MARS 2020 
PARTICIPATING SCIENTIST PROGRAM

Mandatory Notices of Intent for the Mars 2020 Participating Scientist 
Program has been delayed to January 27, 2020. The due date for 
proposals remains unchanged.

A FAQ, Helicopter Proposal Information Package, and Mars 2020 Science 
Team Guidelines have been posted to the NSPIRES page for this program 
element, under "Other Documents". Go to:

https://nspires.nasaprs.com/external/solicitations/summary.do
?solId=%7b166A5742-5756-0A9C-F123-4B65607CF9F2%7d&path=&method=init

The Mars 2020 Participating Scientist Program is to enhance the 
scientific return from the mission, augmenting the existing Mars 2020 
science team to include new investigations that broaden and/or 
complement the funded Principal Investigator-led investigations. The 
second important goal of this opportunity is to increase the number of 
scientists supporting daily mission operations.

This solicitation is timed to permit selection and training of 
participating scientists (PSs) in time to contribute fully to both 
pre-landing activities, such as landing site analysis, and science 
operations immediately upon arrival at Mars. Selected participating 
scientists will become members of the Mars 2020 science team and be 
required to fulfill responsibilities similar to those of current 
science team members.

Questions concerning this program element may be directed to 
Mitchell Schulte at mitchell.d.schulte@nasa.gov.

AOGS 2020 SESSION PS11: GEOLOGY, GEOPHYSICS, AND HABITABILITY IN OUR 
SOLAR SYSTEM

The surfaces of the terrestrial planets and their satellites have been 
largely shaped through geological processes. Extreme conditions on 
outer Solar System bodies, such as the Jovian and Saturnian satellites, 
result in different types of exogenic and endogenic features. 
Fracturing and faulting processes mainly affect minor bodies such as 
asteroids and small moons, where volcanism and tectonism have not 
played an important role. We invite contributions that cover a wide 
range of topics including geomorphology and composition of volcanic 
deposits, edifices, and plumes, volcano-induced deformation and 
edifice growth and collapse to tectonic structures, faulting and 
fracturing processes, crustal stress and strain analysis, 
cryovolcanism, fluvial and aeolian features, and any study related to 
planetary endogenic and exogenic processes. Furthermore, studies that 
relay interactions between planetary interiors, surfaces, atmospheres, 
and astrobiology/habitability are welcomed. Comparative studies of 
geological systems on Earth with a strong remote sensing component are 
encouraged.

The abstract submission deadline is January 21, 2020.

Hope to see you there!

[NASA] FUNDED NPP OPPORTUNITY AT MSFC

Applications are invited for NASA Postdoctoral Fellow (opportunity 
19235) to work with Dr. Caleb Fassett at NASA Marshall Space Flight 
Center. The position was recently funded by a NASA SSW grant entitled 
"Three questions related to crater scaling and production on Mercury, 
the Moon and Mars". The goal of this project is to examine target 
effects on the cratering process and crater populations. The 
expectation is that the NPP would contribute to this research through 
analysis of orbital remote sensing data and/or numerical modeling. 
There is also room for the Postdoctoral Fellow to pursue other topics 
of interest in the broad field of planetary surface processes. 
Interested applicants are welcome to discuss or formulate specific 
research questions with Dr. Fassett before beginning a NPP application 
or proposal.

[NASA] ROSES-19: STEP-1 DUE DATE DELAY FOR E.5 APPLIED INFORMATION 
SYSTEMS RESEARCH

The Applied Information Systems Research (AISR) program seeks 
innovative ideas for applying advanced information and related 
technologies to increase life cycle effectiveness and efficiency of 
SMD programs. This solicitation is for an instance called Autonomous 
Robotics Research for Ocean Worlds (ARROW) to develop autonomy software 
systems to significantly increase the robustness and productivity of 
future Ocean Worlds lander missions.

Specifically, ARROW would seek functional and system-level autonomous 
capabilities for future Ocean Worlds lander missions that:

a) Increase the productivity of surface science operations;
b) Reduce the frequency of ground control contact and uplink/downlink 
   command cycles necessary for surface science operations; and
c) Enable autonomous adaptation to spacecraft faults, degradations, 
   failures or other unexpected conditions.

Step-1 proposals are now due January 21, 2020. The Step-2 proposal due 
date remains unchanged at March 20, 2020.
