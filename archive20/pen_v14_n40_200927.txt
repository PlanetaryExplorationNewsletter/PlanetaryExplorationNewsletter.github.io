JPL POSTDOC IN OCEAN WORLDS ICE SHELLS

https://jpl.jobs/jobs/2020-12443-Postdoctoral-Researcher-Ocean-Worlds-Ice-Shell-Modeling
 
In search of an enthusiastic researcher to join a wonderful group of
icy explorers at JPL! JPL is accepting applications for a postdoctoral
research position in geophysical modeling relevant to the icy layers of
Jupiter's moon Europa, and potentially to other ocean worlds. This may
involve modeling of tectonic processes, constructing analytical or
first-principles arguments, describing ice shell evolution, melting,
freezing, and/or non-ice chemistry incorporation. These results will be
used to understand the potential for future measurements by robotic
spacecraft, and to derive environmental constraints on potential future
concepts for subsurface and ocean access. Dr. Samuel Howell, an ocean
worlds research scientist in the Planetary Interiors and Geophysics
group, will serve as the primary postdoctoral advisor. Please contact
samuel.m.howell@jpl.nasa.gov with any questions. Candidates should have
a recent Ph.D. in geology, planetary science, physics, or a related
field, with a strong background in analytical, numerical, and/or
statistical analysis as applied to geophysical research. Experience in
research relevant to the outer planet satellites and the impacts of
geophysical processes on habitability are highly desirable

FIRST MEETINGS OF THE DECADAL SURVEY SCHEDULED
 
The Steering Group of the Decadal Survey on Planetary Science and
Astrobiology will hold its first three meetings on the following dates:
30 September, 2 October, and 16 October. Agendas and URLs will be
posted on the survey's website as they become available.

IMPORTANT NOTICE FOR NASA PDS DATA USERS

PDS is considering a change to its standards, which may impact users of
PDS data.

The current PDS standard requires that each line in ASCII table data
and most text files ends with Carriage Return (CR) and Line Feed (LF)
characters, the standard format for Windows. The change under
consideration would additionally allow a second format used by Linux
and MacOS systems in which every line ends with a Line Feed character
(LF) alone.

Most software applications can accommodate either format, regardless of
the operating system. However, this change could affect some end users,
especially those who have written software based on the current PDS
standard. The line delimiter will continue to be specified in the PDS4
label accompanying such data files. PDS3 products and labels would be
unchanged.

If and how PDS proceeds with this change depends in large part on the
response of the community. Please send us feedback at sbn@psi.edu.
Please indicate whether you support this change, and how much advanced
notification you would need (e.g., for software revision).
