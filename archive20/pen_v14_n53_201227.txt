We would like to draw your attention to the following session:

T6. Impact cratering on planetary surfaces: Structures and processes

Conveners: Leticia De Marchi, Vinamra Agrawal and David King.

Description: The impact of meteorites, asteroids, and comets is a
fundamental process in the solar system, crucial to planetary formation
and evolution. The resulting impact craters are extremely common
features on the surface of terrestrial planets, asteroids, and natural
satellites. This session explores cratering processes, products, and
implications for geological history.
