[NASA] GRADUATE STUDENT RESEARCH: FUTURE INVESTIGATORS IN NASA EARTH
AND SPACE SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY (FINESST) UPDATE & REMINDERS

1. A summary document from the optional, pre-proposal teleconference
held November 17, 2020, is now available on NSPIRES under "Other
Documents." NOTE: The teleconference summary is not a verbatim
transcript. For the reader's convenience, images of the slides (charts)
are added to make it unnecessary to open a separate file. Clarifying
annotations have been added along with an appendix with questions and
answers (Q&A) received during and in the days following the call
through December 14, 2020.

2. Reminder: Proposals to FINESST are due by February 4, 2021.

3. Email questions/comments to HQ-FINESST@mail.nasa.gov. NASA
expects to respond on an individual basis by email without posting
anonymized versions as additional public Q&As.

Through FINESST, the Science Mission Directorate (SMD) solicits
proposals from accredited U.S. universities and other eligible
organizations for graduate student-designed and performed research
projects that contribute to SMD's science, technology, and exploration
goals funded by the Astrophysics, Earth Science, Heliophysics and
Planetary Science Divisions. Not all SMD Divisions participate in
FINESST.

The teleconference summary is posted at the FINESST research
opportunity homepage at:

OCEAN WORLDS AT LPSC

We are pleased to announce the LPSC Special Session on "The Next Two
Decades of Ocean Worlds Exploration." LPSC abstracts are due January
12, and can be submitted to the special session using the session
selection dropdown menu. This session will focus on current and future
science results, exploration technologies, instrument concepts, and
mission concepts for Ocean Worlds exploration.

Ocean Worlds have emerged as a priority class of targets in planetary
science and astrobiology. The Galileo and Cassini missions provided the
first observations indicating oceans beyond Earth. This perspective was
broadened by the Dawn and New Horizons missions to Ceres and Pluto,
respectively. Today, NASA is planning the Flagship-class Clipper
mission to Europa and New Frontiers-class Dragonfly mission to Titan,
while ESA is planning the L-class JUICE mission to Jupiter's Ocean
Worlds. Future in situ exploration may target icy surfaces, planetary
oceans, plume samples, and exotic traverses. This session will cover
the next two decades of Ocean Worlds exploration, highlighting planned,
proposed, and potential future science investigations, mission
concepts, instruments, and technologies.

2021 NASA PLANETARY SCIENCE SUMMER SCHOOL APPLICATIONS
 
Now due April 1, 2021
 
Offered by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, CA, PSSS is a
3-month long career development experience to learn the development of
a hypothesis-driven robotic space mission in a concurrent engineering
environment while getting an in-depth, first-hand look at mission
design, life cycle, costs, schedule & the trade-offs inherent in each.

Science & engineering doctoral candidates, recent PhDs, postdocs, &
junior faculty who are U.S. citizens or legal permanent residents (and
a very limited number of foreign nationals from non-designated
counties) are eligible. Applicants from diverse backgrounds are
particularly encouraged to apply.
 
Session 1: May 24-Aug 6
Session 2: May 24-Aug 20
 
With workload of a rigorous 3-hour graduate-level course, participants
spend the first 10 weeks in preparatory webinars acting as a science
mission team, & spend the final culminating week mentored by JPL's
Advance Project Design Team to refine their planetary science mission
concept design & present it to a mock expert review board.  The
culminating week is typically at JPL, however in 2021 it is likely to
be virtual due to Covid-19 pandemic conditions.

[NASA] PLANETARY R&A VIRTUAL TOWNHALL 

The Planetary Science Division (PSD) will be holding a virtual townhall
for Research and Analysis (R&A) on Thursday, January 21 at 1 PM Eastern
Time (see below for connect information). In particular, NASA will
present the rollout plan for the elimination of due dates for seven R&A
programs (SSO, SSW, EW, PICASSO, PDART, LARS, and Exobiology). These
programs will be run under a new No Due Date (NoDD) model, which has
been successfully demonstrated by multiple groups at the National
Science Foundation.

GAC-MAC 2021 HYBRID MEETING 

GAC-MAC 2021 hybrid meeting
London Ontario, Canada, May 17-19, 2021
"Exploring Geosciences Through Time and Space"

Dear Planetary Scientists and all-comers,

Are you tired of attending virtual meetings? Come to the Geological
Association of Canada and Mineralogical Association of Canada Joint
Annual Meeting GAC-MAC 2021 this spring in London, Ontario, Canada (May
17-19, 2021) where we will hold a hybrid virtual and onsite meeting -
outdoors in tents, on the beautiful campus at Western University!

We are hosting 40 Sessions (Abstract deadline January 18, 2021),
including several Planetary Science theme sessions, as well as 5 Field
Trips and 8 Workshops / Short Courses. Much of our on-site activities
(posters, exhibits, socials) will be held outdoors in tents, with
plenty of fresh air - and social distancing and masks as required.

Talks and posters will be available online and onsite - so whatever
your preference, consider taking part in GAC-MAC London 2021 next May!
