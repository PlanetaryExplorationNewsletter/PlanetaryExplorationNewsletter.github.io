IN MEMORIAM: ROGER JAY PHILLIPS (1940-2020)
  
Roger Jay Phillips, American geophysicist, planetary scientist and 
professor emeritus at the Washington University in St. Louis, passed 
away on November 19, 2020. Phillips contributed broadly to our 
understanding of the geophysical structure and evolution of the Moon, 
Mars, Venus, and Mercury. He was the team leader for the Apollo 17 
Lunar Sounder Experiment, producing the first radar imaging of the 
lunar subsurface. He was team co-leader for the Shallow Radar (SHARAD) 
experiment on the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter that imaged the internal 
stratigraphy of martian polar layered deposits. He played key roles on 
the science teams for the Magellan mission to Venus, the Mars Global 
Surveyor mission, the MESSENGER mission to Mercury, and the GRAIL 
mission to the Moon. Phillips is well known for contributions to 
understanding the impact crater distribution and resurfacing history 
of Venus. He demonstrated that growth of the huge Tharsis volcanic 
province on Mars shaped the entire planet and influenced the 
distribution and direction of martian valley networks. Phillips was a 
Fellow of the American Geophysical Union, received the 2003 G.K. 
Gilbert Award from the Geological Society of America, and honored with 
the Whipple Award from the AGU in 2008.

[NASA] INDEPENDENT REVIEW BOARD FOR PDE SEEKS INPUT

The NASA Planetary Science Division is conducting an independent review 
of the Planetary Data Ecosystem (PDE), defined as the ad hoc connected 
framework of activities and products that are built upon and support 
the data collected by planetary space missions and research programs 
which are primarily NASA funded. Many familiar tools and databases are 
part of the PDE, including (but not limited to): ADS, AstroMat, DAPs, 
data policies & standards, JMars, JPL Horizons, MAPSIT, NASA Github, 
PDS, Planetary Geologic Mapping, Planetary Photojournal, Quickmap, 
RPIFs, and USGS Astrogeology ISIS3. The PDE Independent Review Board 
will review the current state of the PDE and provide findings and 
prioritized, actionable recommendations that will be used to develop 
an optimal PDE long-term strategy.  To this end, NASA is seeking 
information and gathering community feedback on the PDE via a Request 
for Information (RFI), with responses due November 9, 2020. We 
encourage the planetary sciences community to provide input via this 
RFI. The full text of the RFI and response instructions can be found 
at:

[NASA] EXOPAG CALLING FOR NOMINATIONS TO THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE

The SMD Astrophysics Division is pleased to issue this open call for 
nominations to serve on the Executive Committee (EC) of NASA's 
Exoplanet Exploration Program Analysis Group (ExoPAG). In the coming 
months, NASA anticipates making three new three-year appointments to 
the ExoPAG EC. New appointments will start in the Spring of 2021. The 
ExoPAG is an open, interdisciplinary forum that provides a conduit for 
community input into NASA's Exoplanet Exploration Program (ExEP), and 
for conducting analyses in support of ExEP science objectives and 
their implications for planning and prioritization of Program 
activities. Together, the ExoPAG Chair and Executive Committee are 
responsible for capturing and organizing community input, overseeing 
ExoPAG analyses, reporting ExoPAG findings and inputs to the 
Astrophysics Division Director, and keeping the scientific community 
apprised of ongoing activities and opportunities within NASA's ExEP.

EXOPAG SCIENCE INTEREST GROUP 3 ORGANIZING TUTORIAL TALKS

The ExoPAG Science Interest Group 3 on Exoplanet Solar System Synergies 
is organizing Tutorial Talks aimed at introducing field newcomers to 
important topics or methods in planetary and exoplanetary science. The 
talks include a 30-minute tutorial from an expert to introduce the 
topic, followed by a 30-minute group discussion of a recent paper in 
which the topic/method features. They are held by zoom the 2nd Thursday 
of each month 11 AM PST/ 2 PM EST and recorded so that anyone who can't 
make it can watch them later (or rewatch them since they are so 
informative). We have hosted three talks so far. These talks are hosted 
at our new informational space on the NExSS website:

https://nexss.info/community/exoss-synergy

All are welcome, so feel free to share this announcement and the link 
to the recording of the first tutorial. Also feel free to suggest 
topics you'd like to hear future tutorials on. Vikki Meadows 
(meadows@uw.edu), Mark Marley (mark.s.marley@nasa.gov) and Laura
Schaefer (lkschaef@stanford.edu) are collecting suggestions for future 
tutorials.

PLANETARY GEOMORPHOLOGY AT EGU

Please consider submitting an abstract to the session on Planetary 
Geomorphology (GM11.1/PS7) at vEGU21: Gather Online. vEGU21 is a fully 
virtual replacement for the EGU General Assembly, and will take place 
April 19-30, 2021.

The Planetary Geomorphology session aims to bring together 
geomorphologists who study the Earth with those who work on other 
bodies such as Mars, Venus, Mercury, the Moon, icy satellites of the 
outer solar system, comets, and/or asteroids. Studies applicable to 
landscapes on any scale on any solid body are welcome. We particularly 
encourage those who use Earth analogues or laboratory/numerical 
simulation to submit their work. Considered processes could include 
aeolian, volcanic, tectonic, fluvial, glacial, periglacial, or 
"undetermined" ones. We especially welcome contributions from 
early-career scientists and geomorphologists who are new to planetary 
science.

Session details: 

https://meetingorganizer.copernicus.org/EGU21/session/40278

Abstract instructions:

P/2019 LD2 OBSERVING CAMPAIGN COORDINATION

P/2019 LD2 (ATLAS) is a recently discovered active centaur, on an 
unstable orbit that is evolving towards the inner solar system and a 
potential future as a Jupiter Family Comet. This object presents a 
unique opportunity, which enables us to monitor a Centaur as its 
activity evolves and it transitions to an inner solar system object 
for what is likely the first time. LD2 is currently (and starting 
April/May 2021) observable as a northern hemisphere nighttime object at 
~18th visual magnitude. It is a high priority target for 
characterization of composition, continuous activity and outbursts. 

We encourage the community - those with planned, scheduled or completed 
observations - to participate in a observing campaign coordination, 
through the following webpage:

https://observe-ld2.blogspot.com

The webpage includes a short observing record form. Note that signing 
up here does not commit anyone to sharing their data, but we hope this 
will become a natural gathering place for researchers to see who else 
will be at the telescope and when, and perhaps initiate some new 
collaborations.

Sincerely, 

G. Sarid, L. Woodney, M. Womack

REPORT OF THE INDEPENDENT REVIEW BOARD FOR MARS SAMPLE RETURN

NASA, ESA and the worldwide science community are about to embark on 
one of the most complex and challenging robotic science campaigns ever 
attempted, Mars Sample Return (MSR). MSR was the highest priority for 
flagship missions of the 2011 Planetary Decadal Survey (Visions and 
Voyages, 2011). MSR requires samples to be carefully selected and 
cached by NASA's Perseverance rover, now on its way to Mars, and 
returned to Earth for intensive analyses.

To assess whether the next phase of MSR is ready to go forward, NASA 
initiated a series of reviews. A Standing Review Board (SRB) conducted 
a Mission Concept Review in October 2020 as part of the process to 
determine whether to move the next MSR flight projects into Phase A. 
That report is expected sometime this month. In an unusual step, NASA 
also convened an Independent Review Board (IRB) in this pre-Phase A 
period to evaluate the technical, programmatic, and scientific readiness 
of what is not a single project, but rather a campaign consisting of 
multiple discrete and tightly coupled major space projects. That report 
and NASA's response is at:
