IN MEMORIAM: ADAM SHOWMAN (1968-2020)

Adam Showman, a Professor of Planetary Sciences at the University of
Arizona's Lunar and Planetary Laboratory, passed away suddenly on March
16, 2020. Prof. Showman had a wide range of interests and expertise.
Most notably he was an expert in both the atmospheres and interiors of
planets. His atmospheric work concentrated on  giant gaseous planets
like Jupiter, Saturn and many of the extrasolar planets that have been
discovered, while most of his work on interiors dealt with the icy
satellites that orbit the Solar System's giant planets.

Prof. Showman was born in 1968, and received his B.S. in Physics from
Stanford in 1991 and his Ph.D. in Planetary Sciences for the California
Institute of Technology in 1999, then joined LPL in 2001. He published
a total of more than 150 scientific papers.

Prof. Showman served as the advisor for eight University of Arizona
students who receive their Ph.D.s, and as the mentor for six
post-doctoral fellows. He was named a Galileo Circle Fellow by the
University of Arizona College of Science in 2018, and was named a
Fellow of the American Geophysical Union in 2019.

[NASA] ROSES: XRP STEP 1 IS NOW NOI

Additionally, because it is not practical to extend the due date for
E.3 Exoplanets Research, instead the Step-1 proposal has been converted
to a Mandatory Notice of Intent (NOI). An NOI can be submitted by the
PI, which streamlines the submission process. NOIs are due on the
original Step-1 due date of March 27, 2020. Proposers who have already
submitted a Step-1 proposal need not take any additional action.
Proposers who have a Step-1 proposal in process may still submit the
Step-1 by the due date or may submit an NOI instead. Note that any
Step-1 proposal submitted between the date of this amendment and the
due date will be marked as late by NSPIRES, but please ignore that; as
long as it is submitted by the due date, it will be considered on time.

Questions about E.3 Exoplanets Research may be directed to Richard
Eckman, Earth Science Division at richard.s.eckman@nasa.gov; Galen
Fowler, Heliophysics Division at galen.fowler@nasa.gov; Douglas
Hudgins, Astrophysics Division at douglas.m.hudgins@nasa.gov; or
Stephen Rinehart, Planetary Science Division at
