ROSES-20: C.22 RADIOISOTOPE POWER SYSTEMS NOT SOLICITED

REMBRandT seeks to enable advancements in thermoelectric, thermionic, 
thermodynamic cycle-based technology, and other viable means of 
converting heat flux directly into electrical energy for use in 
radioisotope power systems for deep space science missions. The goals 
of the program are to improve radioisotope power systems by:

- increasing their performance, reliability, and efficiency
- enabling long life operation (greater than 20 years)
- enhancing manufacturing processes for materials and components

ROSES-2020 Amendment 20 announces that REMBRandT, which was TBD, will 
not be solicited in ROSES-2020.
 
Questions concerning REMBRandT may be directed to Leah Nakley at 
leah.m.nakley@nasa.gov.

PH.D. STUDENT IN SPACE PHYSICS FOR STUDIES OF SPACE PLASMAS

The Swedish Institute of Space Physics (IRF) is looking for a Ph.D. 
student in Space Physics. The position is related to studies of space 
plasmas.

Applications are invited for a Ph.D. student to study kinetic plasma 
processes operating in space plasma regions of fundamental importance, 
such as magnetic reconnection sites, shocks, and turbulence regions. 
Such processes operate in most astrophysical plasma environments 
leading to plasma heating and production of energetic particles.

You will work directly with state-of-the-art experimental data from 
the NASA multi-spacecraft (MMS) mission.

The position is available at the IRF-office in Uppsala, starting at 
the latest in the second half of 2020 for a total of four years.

The Swedish National Space Agency, the Swedish Research Council and 
Uppsala University fund the position.

IRF is a government agency that conducts research and postgraduate 
education in space physics, atmospheric physics and space technology. 
Many of IRF's projects are run as international projects in 
collaboration with other research institutes and space agencies. IRF 
has about 100 employees and offices in Kiruna (headquarters), Umea, 
Uppsala and Lund.

OUTER PLANET MOON-MAGNETOSPHERE INTERACTION WORKSHOP

Dates: November 5-6, 2020 (directly after JUICE SWT/PI meeting)

Location: ESA/ESTEC

Registration and abstract submission is now open: 

https://indico.esa.int/event/337/

Please note that the number of participants is limited to 60 people.

The focus of this workshop is the interaction between the outer planet 
moons in our Solar System and their magnetospheric environment, in 
preparation of upcoming missions like JUICE and Europa Clipper.

Abstracts addressing moon-magnetosphere interaction from all 
disciplines are welcome, including ground-based and Earth-orbit based 
observation, simulation results, theory, in-situ and remote sensing 
data analysis. We welcome results from past missions such as Voyager, 
Galileo and Cassini-Huygens, and current missions such as Hisaki and 
JUNO.

COVID19: We hope the workshop will go ahead as planned in person. 
However, we are committed to shifting to an online conference in case 
the situation regarding COVID19 prevents us from meeting in person.
Please do not make any accommodation and/or travel bookings that are 
not fully refundable.

Best regards,

Mika Holmberg, Lina Hadid and Hans Huybrighs
