ICARUS NEWS: REDUCED OPEN ACCESS FEES

The maximum Open Access fee for Icarus has been reduced from $2900 to
$2680. The fee may be less than this amount or free, as a growing
number of countries and institutes have agreements with Elsevier to
reduce or completely cover the costs of open access publishing in
Elsevier journals (including Icarus). Some national, funder, or
institution level agreements completely cover the cost of open access
publishing fees for eligible authors. These agreements include (but are
not limited to):
 
Several UK institutions:

https://www.elsevier.com/about/open-science/open-access/agreements/JISC
-prepaid-open-access-plan

Carnegie Mellon University (USA)
Sweden
Norway
Netherlands
Ireland
Hungary
Poland
 
Authors can check what reduction of cost they may be eligible for here:

https://www.elsevier.com/about/open-science/open-access/agreements 
 
As agreements are being updated frequently, the agreements page will be
the place to find the most up-to-date information on open access fee
reductions and requirements. The open access fee reductions and
coverages are integrated into the acceptance pages in the submission
system which authors are taken through once their article is accepted
and ready to publish.

COSPAR 2020 SESSION 20-F3.6: CLIMATE AND ASTROBIOLOGICAL POTENTIAL OF
ICY DEPOSITS ON MARS

Please consider submitting an abstract to the session that joins Mars
climate scientists and astrobiologists at the 43rd COSPAR Scientific
Assembly on August 15-22 in Sydney, Australia.

The planet Mars contains numerous, massive deposits of water ice that
are spread over the polar regions and the mid-latitudes in each
hemisphere. Many of the deposits contain a layered record of Mars
climate history going back millions to hundreds of millions of years.
They may be considered habitable by extant or extinct life. The
potential to discover the climate history of Mars in those ice deposits
is immense. Further, the astrobiological potential of polar and
mid-latitude ice deposits may cover a wide range based on variable
salinity, acidity, pH, and temperature. It is important that
astrobiologists and Mars ice + climate scientists continue discussions
about the properties of ice in order to design future missions that are
well prepared to assess the climate and astrobiological potential of
icy deposits on Mars.

Abstract deadline: February 14, 2020

AOGS2020 SESSION PS-09: PLANETARY DATA IN THE BIG DATA ERA - ARCHIVES,
TOOLS, AND INTERNATIONAL COLLABORATIONS

Abstract deadline extended to February 4, 2020

Asia Oceania Geosciences Conference 2020

June 28 - July 4, Sono Belle Vivaldi Park, Hongcheon, Korea

Conference website:

http://www.asiaoceania.org/aogs2020/public.asp?page=home.html

Enormous volumes of data are being generated every day in planetary
science researches. Data technologies are playing more and more
important roles in planetary researches, especially in the big data
era. Long-term preservation and unrestricted sharing of all planetary
data have been recognized to be essential for the development of
researches and rapid generations of new knowledge. This session
provides us with a forum to present and discuss new developments
related to planetary science data science, including but not limited
to, archiving standards, archive organizations, data services and
accessibilities, indexing and searching, data mining and manipulation,
and applications of big data technology and artificial intelligence in
data analysis, in order to facilitate effective and efficient planetary
data archiving and sharing around the globe in the future.

Conveners:  Jian-Yang Li (Planetary Science Institute, USA), Sebastien
Besse (ESA), Ludmilla Kolokolova (University of Maryland, USA), Yukio

JPGU-AGU JOINT MEETING 2020 SESSION P-AE22: EXOPLANETS

We call your attention and invite contributed talks for the JpGU-AGU
Joint Meeting 2020 Session P-AE22 on "Exoplanets". Abstract submission
is open until February 18 at 5 PM JST (Early registration: February 4,
11:59 PM JST). The meeting 2020 will be held May 24-28, 2020 in 
Makuhari Messe, Chiba, Japan.

http://www.jpgu.org/meeting_e2020/

Exoplanetary science, which began with the discovery of a hot Jupiter
in 1995, reached a significant turning point by the detection of
countless super-Earths by the Kepler space telescope. Recent
observations have identified a growing number of terrestrial planets in
the so-called habitable zone. While exoplanets have been targeted
mainly for astronomy until recently, it would be fair to say that Earth
and planetary science is finally becoming a research field to make a
central contribution. This session aims at allowing participants to
share their research results and new ideas regarding exoplanets and
also inform the current status of their projects. Exoplanet science is
a growing, interdisciplinary research field. We welcome participants
from various fields.

MICROSYMPOSIUM 61 PLANETS UNDERGROUND: THE NEXT FRONTIER IN PLANETARY 
EXPLORATION

The third dimension of planetary bodies remains largely unexplored, yet
is a frontier for expanding our knowledge of planetary evolution and
habitability. Groundbreaking discoveries of the Moon's low crustal
porosity by the GRAIL mission are transformative and have profound
implications for understanding the subsurface habitability of Mars,
Early Earth and other planets. While the surface of Mars, Europa and
Enceladus are widely considered to be uninhabitable, their subsurfaces
are hypothesized to be the long-lived habitable environments. We are 
learning more and more of the vast world of Life Underground on Earth 
from the diverse, yet largely unexplored biology to the prospects of 
billion-year old groundwater.

Microsymposium 61, Planets Underground, poses many exciting science
questions and the technological challenges to acquire measurements
relevant to these questions. The program will be a mix of invited and
contributed papers and will convene on Saturday, March 14, 2020 (1 PM-6
PM) and Sunday, March 15, 2020 (8:30 AM-12 Noon). The Microsymposium
will emphasize an open discussion format, anchored by invited
overviews, contributed talks and posters. Details for the
Microsymposium, including a registration page:

MEPAG SERVICE ANNOUNCEMENT: DIRECTOR OF THE MARS SAMPLE RETURN CAMPAIGN 
SENIOR EXECUTIVE SERVICE OPPORTUNITY

With the Mars 2020 Rover about to ship to Florida for preparations for
launch this July, NASA HQ has been considering options for organizing
the remaining elements of the Mars Sample Return campaign. Recently,
HQ posted a senior executive service opportunity for a Director of the
Mars Sample Return campaign. The announcement indicates that this
individual will be responsible for implementation of all MSR program
activities and will report to the SMD Associate Administrator.
Applications are expected to have demonstrated skill in the
formulation, development and implementation of spaceflight programs,
particularly programs involving multiple stakeholders, and demonstrated
experience managing spaceflight program financial, schedule, and policy
constraints. The closing date for applications is Feb. 5.

POST-DOC ON ASTEROID/COMET OBSERVATIONS AT THE UNIVERSITY OF EDINBURGH

The Institute for Astronomy at the University of Edinburgh is offering
a post-doc position on asteroid/comet observations, funded as part of
the EU NEOROCKS programme on near-Earth asteroids. This is a one year
position, which will hopefully be extended depending on future
applications for funding to extend the work for other surveys (e.g.
LSST, maybe EUCLID). The main goal will be to develop software that
will be useful for surveys to search for faint comet-like activity.
