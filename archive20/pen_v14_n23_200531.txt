[NASA] RELEASES THE NEW SCIENCE PLAN: SCIENCE 2020-2024: A VISION FOR
SCIENTIFIC EXCELLENCE

Members of the science community are invited to download the Science
Mission Directorate's (SMD's) newest version of its Science Plan,
Science 2020-2024: A Vision for Scientific Excellence, at:

https://science.nasa.gov/about-us/science-strategy

This document was developed through close collaboration with the entire
SMD leadership team and NASA Center Directors and was reviewed by the
NASA Advisory Committee's Science Committee and the Space Studies
Board. It lays out an ambitious program over next five years to build
on current activities and drive change in high-priority areas where SMD
can have the greatest impact. 

SMD encourages all members of the community to read the document to
learn about these priorities and the exciting work being done across
the entire SMD portfolio.

EPSC SESSION TP7: IONOSPHERES OF UNMAGNETIZED OR WEAKLY MAGNETIZED
BODIES 

Virtual meeting
21 September- 9 October 2020

We encourage abstract submissions to our EPSC 2020 session. The
session will focus on the analysis of ionospheres of weakly magnetized
bodies with substantial atmospheres (e.g. Mars, Venus, Titan, Pluto and
comets), and how each body reacts to space weather disturbances.
Understanding how each unmagnetized body reacts to all these factors is
a key in comparative aeronomy because although a priori all of them
have a general similar behavior, they also have scientifically
important differences caused by their different natures. We solicit
abstracts concerning remote and in situ data analysis, modeling
studies, instrumentation and mission concepts. Topics may include, but
are not limited to, day and night side ionospheric variability, sources
and influences of ionization, ion-neutral coupling, current systems,
comparative ionospheric studies, and solar wind-ionosphere interactions
and responses of the ionized and neutral regimes to transient space
weather events. Abstracts on general plasma and escape processes are
also welcome.

https://meetingorganizer.copernicus.org/EPSC2020/session/38507

Deadline: 24 June 2020

Conveners: Beatriz Sanchez-Cano, Matteo Crismani, Niklas Edberg, 
Xiaohua Fang, and Francisco Gonzalez-Galindo

LUNAR AND SMALL BODIES GRADUATE CONFERENCE 2020 ANNOUNCEMENT 

Abstract submission deadline: June 19, 2020

The 10th Annual Lunar and Small Bodies Graduate Conference (LunGradCon
2020) is to be held virtually on Wednesday and Thursday, July 1-2
2020, preceding the NASA Exploration Science Forum (ESF, July 8-10).
With the expanded interests of the Solar System Exploration Research
Virtual Institute (SSERVI), the scope of LunGradCon includes both lunar
and small body science. LunGradCon provides an opportunity for grad
students and early-career postdocs to present their research on lunar
and small body science in a low-stress, friendly environment, being
critiqued only by their peers. In addition to virtual presentations,
the conference will feature Q&A panels with various groups to help grad
students navigate the paths to careers in space science. The deadline
for LunGradCon registration and abstract submission is June 19, 2019,
11:59 PM PDT.

POSTDOCTORAL RESEARCHER IN PLANETARY MAGNETOSPHERIC PHYSICS 

Applications are now being accepted for two postdoctoral scientists to
work with the NASA/Goddard Space Flight Center Planetary Magnetospheres
Laboratory in Greenbelt, MD. The position is funded through the CRESST
II.

Position 1: The postdoctoral researcher will work for either the Juno
project with the primary responsibility of conducting analysis and
publishing the magnetometer results. In addition, the candidate will
assist with the magnetometer data validation and calibration.

Position 2: The data scientist's primary responsibility will be to
develop a data production pipeline for future magnetometer missions.
This involves taking raw magnetometer data, applying the appropriate
transformations and calibrations, and producing the final public data
products. The data scientist is encouraged to pursue their own research
interest.

Candidates for this position should have earned a Ph.D. in physics,
astronomy, planetary science, space physics, geosciences, or related
fields. Successful candidates should also have expertise with one or
more programming languages commonly used in space science and a
demonstrated track record in analyzing spaceflight data, especially
magnetometer data and experience with the NAIF SPICE software package
is highly desired.

Applications received by July 15, 2020 will receive the best
consideration.

POSTDOC POSITION IN PLANETARY SEISMOLOGY

The Geophysical Institute at the University of Alaska Fairbanks has an
immediate opening for a postdoctoral researcher in the field of
planetary seismology. The new hire will engage in a project to
establish bounds on the nature and amount of seismic activity on
Venus, assemble a catalog of Venus-analog events using
records from a variety of traditional and non-traditional seismic
sources, and then use the catalog to evaluate the viability of 
potential instrument designs and analysis algorithms for an eventual 
seismograph on Venus. This is a one-year project, but a strong 
performer could transition into a multi-year position conducting a TBD 
mix of terrestrial and planetary seismology. Candidate is expected to 
be well-versed in earthquake seismology; familiarity with planetary
science is desirable but not required. More information can be found 
here:

Directions on how to apply:

https://careers.alaska.edu/en-us/job/514947/planetary-seismology-postdoctoral-fellow.

Review of applications will begins June 22, but applications will be 
accepted until the position is filled; our desire is to have a person 
in place by late summer.
