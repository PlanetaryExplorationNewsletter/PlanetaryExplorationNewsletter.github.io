ISP STUDY EXPLORATORY WORKSHOP

Interstellar Probe Study Community,

We are almost a month away from the third annual ISP Study Exploratory
Workshop, and we can't wait to see you there! As a reminder, this event
will be held remotely via Zoom.

We have two important announcements for you.

First: Please register to participate! Registration is now open on the
website (link below).

Second: Please submit your abstracts! We're looking for everyone to
share their ideas that further the workshop's goal, namely, gathering
together and discussing the objectives, design, and operations for a
near-term, pragmatic interstellar probe mission. Please follow the
instructions on the event page to submit your abstract (link below).
Abstracts are due by 23 October.

You can both register and submit your abstracts at the event website
here: 

http://interstellarprobe.jhuapl.edu/Resources/Meetings/agenda.php?id=112
 
Help us spread the word about this event! Feel free to forward this
information, and let us know if there are any newsletters or listservs
this should also be forwarded to.
 
Thanks so much!
Interstellar Probe Study Team

MEPAG VM10 2ND INFORMATION CIRCULAR

2nd Information Circular
10th Virtual MEPAG Meeting (VM10)
Tuesday, October 20, 2020
1:00 pm - 4:00 pm EDT
  
I cordially invite you to participate in the next virtual meeting
(VM10) of the Mars Exploration Program Analysis Group (MEPAG). The
meeting will be recorded and the chat box comments captured for those
of you who are unable to attend. Those items will be posted at

https://mepag.jpl.nasa.gov/meetings.cfm?expand=vm10

The agenda is below and includes updates about recent MEPAG, Mars
Exploration Program, and Decadal Survey activities, with an extended
discussion on Planetary Protection (PP) developments. Scott Hubbard
will provide an overview of recent NASEM Reviews (e.g., Assessment of
the Report of NASA's Planetary Protection Independent Review Board) and
Lisa Pratt will discuss the formation of the NASEM Committee on
Planetary Protection (CoPP) and other responses to various external
reviews. Additionally, Curt Niebur will give a presentation about the
New Frontiers 5 AO Status, and Justin Filiberto will discuss a new LPI
initiative: Brines across the Solar System.

WebEx connectivity information is below. This meeting is open to all
members of the Mars science community including our international
colleagues, and I look forward to your participation.
 
Dr. R. Aileen Yingst
MEPAG Chair

UPCOMING JOB ANNOUNCEMENT - NASA MSFC
 
The Heliophysics and Planetary Science Branch at NASA Marshall Space
Flight Center plans to offer multiple positions to conduct research and
applications to solve Planetary Science problems. Outstanding
candidates have the potential to be selected for federal employment.
The candidate will perform research focused on remote sensing geologic
and related investigations of planets, moons, and asteroids, and the
development of instrumentation for planetary science. We are interested
in complementing our existing expertise in geology, geomorphology,
surface processes, volcanology, and geophysics. The candidate is also
expected to bring or build a strong independent scientific research
program through peer-reviewed proposals to NASA programs and/or through
involvement in NASA planetary missions. Additionally, the candidate
will advise science integration in exploration endeavors, including the
Space Launch System and the Artemis program.

All candidates must use the USAJobs.gov website to prepare and submit
applications, and United States citizenship is required. The positions
are expected to be announced soon, autumn 2020, under the category of
Research Space Scientist and at the GS-13 grade level. Candidates are
encouraged to create a USAJobs profile well in advance. Informal
inquiries can be directed to Dr. David McKenzie,
david.e.mckenzie@nasa.gov, 256-961-7896.

WE ARE LOOKING FOR NEW BOOK IDEAS

From: Andreas Keiling (UC Berkeley), Xianzhe Jia (Univ. Michigan), Bea
Gallardo-Lacourt (NASA GSFC), and Valery Nakariakov (Univ. Warwick)

The AGU Books program has a new Editorial Board that is seeking to
commission new books across the Earth and Space Sciences to serve our
community of researchers, students, and educators.

Do you know of some scientific advances that would be well-suited to
being presented in book format? Is there a course you teach that needs
a new textbook? Do you know someone who would be ideal to write or edit
a new book?

Andreas Keiling and Kate Lajtha, the two Editors-in-Chief, are
supported by an exciting and diverse team of 11 Editors to cover all
disciplines, including planetary science. Check them out at:

https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/hub/books-editorial-board

You can contact one of the Editors-in-Chief or one of the specialty
editors covering your field of research to discuss book ideas and the
proposal process.

MACHINE LEARNING FOR SCIENCE (ML4SCI) HACKATHON

A consortium of universities led by the University of Alabama and Brown
University are hosting a virtual hackathon focused on the application
of machine learning to science (ML4SCI). There will be six challenges,
including one focused on planetary science (identification of
cosmic-ray artifacts in images acquired by planetary science missions).
This year's event will run virtually from October 26-30.
Participants are encouraged to self-organize into small teams or
participate on their own to devise unique solutions to the challenges.
Participants will have opportunities to interact with the organizers
and each other via Slack. The Zoom kickoff meeting is on October 26 (5
PM EDT) and accessible via:
