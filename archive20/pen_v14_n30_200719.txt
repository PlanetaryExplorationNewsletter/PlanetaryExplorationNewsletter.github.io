AGU SESSION P002: AQUAPLANETOLOGY - AQUEOUS ENVIRONMENTS AND 
HABTIABILITY IN THE SOLAR SYSTEM

Conveners: Y. Sekine*, G. Tobie, B. L. Ehlmann, M. Cable (* primary)

https://agu.confex.com/agu/fm20/prelim.cgi/Session/102100

We welcome contributions to advance our understanding of the formation
and evolution of aqueous environments on Solar System bodies.

Recent advances in spacecraft explorations have revealed the presence 
of liquid water on multiple Solar System bodies, including Mars, icy 
satellites, and volatile-rich dwarf planets. To further understand the 
formation, evolution, and habitability of these "aquaplanets" in the 
Solar System, knowledge of physico-chemical processes that characterize 
aqueous environments becomes critical. These processes include 
water-rock reactions, hydrological and geochemical cycles, 
photochemistry, and tectonics. These processes generate both oxidants 
and reductants and transport them in hydrospheres, creating 
bioavailable chemical disequilibria. This session covers topics 
relevant to physico-chemical processes on aquaplanets (including Earth, 
Mars, water-altered asteroids, and ocean worlds), e.g., geochemical 
processes on terrestrial planets and icy bodies, planetary hydrology, 
icy tectonics, and planetary organic chemistry. This session also 
welcomes observational studies of geochemical signatures of aqueous 
environments on Solar System bodies using spacecraft, rovers, and 
telescopes.

AGU SESSION P008: COMPARATIVE PLANETOLOGY - LARGE PLANETESIMALS AND
DWARF PLANETS THROUGHOUT THE SOLAR SYSTEM

Observations returned by space missions (e.g., Dawn, New Horizons, 
Cassini) and large Earth-bound telescopic surveys (e.g., NEOWISE, 
Adaptive optics observations) over the past decade offer a broad 
encompassing view of the population of large planetesimals and dwarf 
planets that formed shortly after Solar System formation. Most of these 
bodies have retained information on their accretional environments 
while others have undergone significant internal evolution.

The Psyche and Lucy missions now prepare to continue deciphering the 
Solar System's early history with the exploration of 16 Psyche and 
Jupiter's Trojan asteroids, while instruments on the extremely large 
telescopes available in the next decade will provide observations with 
unprecedented details of many large planetesimals.

This session welcomes abstracts that address new observations and 
models of large planetesimals found across the Solar System, compare 
and contrast the properties of planetesimals found in various small 
body reservoirs, and address their possible genetic relationships.

AGU SESSION P012: ENCELADUS - A HABITABLE WORLD BECKONS

Saturn's small yet active icy moon remains one of the most 
scientifically compelling worlds in the Solar System.

In this long-running special session, now in its 15th year, we seek to 
sustain a highly multidisciplinary and stimulating atmosphere that 
enables a deeper understanding of the nature and causes of Enceladus' 
activity. We encourage submissions that specifically provide insights 
into the moon's interior, biological potential, surface morphology, 
south polar plume, and space environment from diverse disciplines: 
e.g., planetary geology, comparative planetology of relevant icy 
satellites, terrestrial studies, hydrothermal systems, oceanography, 
geodynamics, tectonics, volcanology, space physics, organic chemistry, 
geochemistry, astrobiology, origins of life, microbiology, and 
biosignatures. Field, laboratory, and theoretical studies are all 
welcome.

We also welcome contributions on Cassini data analysis and modeling, as 
well as instrument and mission concept developments that will lay the 
groundwork for a new generation of explorers to Enceladus.

AGU SESSION P021: MACHINE LEARNING FOR PLANETARY SCIENCE

As increasingly large, complex datasets are acquired, autonomy and 
machine intelligence will have a critical role in interpreting data 
from planetary exploration missions. There is a need for frameworks 
that can rapidly and intelligently extract information from these 
datasets in a manner useful for scientific analysis. Such innovations 
will largely be driven by machine learning (ML), which describes 
methods in which computers learn from data rather than explicit 
programming.This session will explore research leveraging ML methods 
to enhance our scientific understanding and increase the scientific 
return from planetary data and missions. Topics may encompass data 
analysis on the ground or onboard spacecraft for existing and future 
missions and instruments. Submissions are welcome for ML applications 
across science and engineering for planetary science, including but not 
limited to: spacecraft operations and mission planning; surface, 
atmosphere, and space environment characterization; object detection; 
and other studies that apply ML to planetary science.

AGU SESSION P022: MARS CLIMATE AND EVEN MORE WATER - LATE-HESPERIAN TO 
AMAZONIAN SURFACE AND GROUND WATER FEATURES ON MARS

Until recently, the era with significant surface and groundwater 
activity on Mars was assumed to end at ~3.0 Ga, before the Amazonian. 
Recent data from in situ and orbital datasets suggest the early 
Amazonian may have been wetter than previously thought, and that more 
recent glacio-fluvial events may have occurred. This evidence includes 
inverted channels, eskers, groundwater seepage depressions, and narrow 
channels on units dating to the Late Hesperian and perhaps younger. 
Furthermore, the Mars rovers, especially Curiosity, have found evidence 
of multiple diagenetic events indicating a variety of groundwater 
chemistries that altered rock units and fossil sand dunes. In Gale 
Crater, these events appear to significantly post-date deposition and 
erosion of presumed Hesperian Gale lake deposits. In this session, we 
welcome abstracts that discuss likely late- or post-Hesperian 
glacio-fluvial features from in situ, orbital, and martian meteorite 
datasets, that aid our understanding of post-Hesperian water and climate 
on Mars.

AGU SESSION P037: SMALL BODIES - PHYSICAL PROPERTIES AND REGOLITH 
BEHAVIORS UNDER MICROGRAVITY

We would like to invite the community to consider submitting an 
abstract to the following session for the AGU Fall Meeting 2020.

Small bodies (asteroids, comets, and many moons) are processed 
leftovers from the formation stage of the Solar System. On these 
bodies, gravity plays a smaller role than many other forces, and thus 
the materials may behave differently from those on terrestrial planets. 
Such behavior is highly dependent on the physical properties of these 
objects, and especially on the granular materials and regolith that 
shape their surfaces and interiors. However, these features are not 
well understood, and there are unsolved issues regarding connections 
between processes happening on these bodies and their physical 
properties. Efforts in characterizing the nature of regolith on small 
bodies and the relevant evolution of the bodies themselves, have been 
made in the areas of modeling, experiments, and remote-sensing 
observations. This session invites papers from these techniques to 
better understand the complex environments of small bodies, as well as 
their physical properties and regolith behavior.

AGU SESSION SH001: INTERSTELLAR PROBE - PUSHING THE BOUNDARIES OF SPACE
EXPLORATION

Abstract Deadline: July 29, 23:59 EDT

https://agu.confex.com/agu/fm20/prelim.cgi/Session/103634

An Interstellar Probe through the heliospheric boundary, into the 
Interstellar Medium, opens a new regime of space physics to understand 
the global nature of our habitable astrosphere and to explore the 
Interstellar Cloud. Kuiper Belt and dust disk observations provide 
unique insights into the evolution of our Solar System. Outside the 
zodiacal cloud, the unobscured infrared sky reveals new information on 
early galaxy formation. The recent interest in an Interstellar Probe 
launching in the 2030's is fueled by the mysteries uncovered by the 
aging Voyager mission, the unexpected IBEX and Cassini discoveries, 
and conventional propulsion improvements that enable delivering a probe 
to the heliospheric boundary in ~10 years. This session seeks 
presentations on the unique science observations that an Interstellar 
Probe enables across the physics of the heliosphere and beyond, and 
also planetary science, and astrophysics. Status of enabling 
technologies in propulsion, communication, power, instrumentation, 
and programmatic aspects are encouraged.

AGU SESSION SM017: MAGNETOSPHERES IN THE OUTER SOLAR SYSTEM

Conveners: Xianzhe Jia (Univ. of Michigan), Chris Paranicas (JHU/APL) 
and George Hospodarsky (Univ. of Iowa)

This session invites submissions covering the structure and dynamics 
of the magnetospheres of the giant planets (Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus 
and Neptune) as well as Ganymede. Papers on magnetospheric and auroral 
processes including magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling, plasma 
transport, tail dynamics, rotational modulations, magnetospheric 
boundaries, and the role of the solar wind are consistent with our 
session themes. We particularly encourage submissions that compare the 
giant planet magnetospheres to one another, or compare them to those 
of terrestrial planets. The session will be an ideal forum for the 
discussion of recent advances in our understanding of all these 
systems enabled by in situ and remote observations as well as 
theoretical and numerical modeling, and relevant to a number of 
ongoing and future planetary missions to the outer Solar System.

51 PEGASUS B FELLOWSHIP IN PLANETARY ASTRONOMY

Planetary astronomy brings together research efforts of two 
fields—planetary science and astronomy - to characterize planetary 
systems. The fellowship supports postdoctoral fellows to advance our 
fundamental understanding of exoplanets, Solar System science, planet 
formation and evolution, planetary atmospheres, protoplanetary disks, 
or other closely related topics. The fellowship recognizes early-career 
investigators of significant potential and provides them with the 
opportunity to conduct independent research. Each recipient will 
receive a three-year grant of up to $375,000 to cover salary, benefits, 
highly-flexible discretionary spending (e.g., travel, family care, 
moving expenses, research equipment, personal computers, etc.), and 
indirect costs. 

The Foundation anticipates awarding six to eight fellowships this year, 
based on the quality of submissions. The Heising-Simons Foundation is 
committed to diversity, equity, and inclusion. Thus, we particularly 
welcome applications from individuals who belong to groups that have 
been historically underrepresented in planetary sciences and astronomy 
such as women, persons with disabilities, racial and ethnic minorities, 
persons of minority sexual orientation or gender identity, and others 
who may contribute to diversification of the field.

The 2020-2021 Fellowship cycle is now open. Applications will be 
accepted until 11:59PM Eastern Time on Friday October 2, 2020. Go to:

WHITE PAPER ON PLASMA AND MAGNETIC INSTRUMENTS IN SMALL BODY MISSIONS

We invite co-signers for our paper, "The Importance of Plasma and 
Magnetic Investigations in Small Body Missions." The paper highlights 
the small body science that can be conducted with this instrumentation 
(internal layering/composition, remanent magnetism, space weathering, 
and outgassing detection) and proposes a ride-along program be created 
which would allow for continuous heliospheric monitoring en route and 
upon arrival at the target body using these missions.
