AOGS 2020 SESSION PS03: TO THE MOON TO STAY - THE ARTEMIS ERA

At the upcoming AOGS 2020 conference in South Korea from June 28 to 
July 4 we will have the opportunity to discuss future activities on the 
Moon by the international community. This series of talks will discuss 
how we can develop a sustained, ongoing human presence on the Moon, 
eventually leading to human missions to Mars. In this session, 
contributed presentations will focus on four major themes: new lunar 
science, human exploration, in-situ resource utilization, and 
sustainability. Such a long-term presence on the Moon will require new 
types of infrastructure and methods for constructing it. These new ways 
to live and work on another planetary body are the cornerstone of 
future exploration of the Solar System. So let's get this discussion 
going.

Presentations covering any aspect in this thematic chain are 
encouraged. Please note that the abstract submission deadline is 
January 21, 2020.

AOGS 2020 SESSION PS09: PLANETARY DATA IN THE BIG DATA ERA - ARCHIVES,
TOOLS, AND INTERNATIONAL COLLABORATIONS

June 28-July 4, Sono Belle Vivaldi Park, Hongcheon, Korea
Abstract deadline: January 21, 2020

Conference website: 

http://www.asiaoceania.org/aogs2020/public.asp?page=home.html

This session is about all aspects of planetary science data science, 
including but not limited to, archiving standards, archive 
organizations, data services and accessibility, indexing and searching, 
data mining and manipulation, and applications of big data technology 
and artificial intelligence in data analysis. Enormous volumes of 
planetary data are being generated every day, playing more and more 
important roles in planetary research. Long-term preservation and 
unrestricted sharing of all planetary data have been recognized to be 
essential. A number of data archiving organizations are currently 
running and providing archiving services for data covering all areas 
of planetary research. This session provides us with a forum to present 
and discuss the new developments in the related activities, 
technologies, and concepts related to planetary science data to 
facilitate effective and efficient planetary data archiving and sharing 
around the globe in the future.

AOGS 2020 SESSION PS12: FROM THE SOLAR SYSTEM ORIGIN TO THE PLANETARY
SYSTEM BODIES

During the last 25 years the ALMA and exoplanets observations and 
missions in the inner and outer Solar System have already brought 
planetary science to a new level. It is now time to fully exploit these 
observational and instrumental efforts, boosting the synergy between 
the solar system and planet formation community. The interpretation of 
the acquired data have raised many questions on the processes involved 
in the formation of planetary bodies and their dynamical evolution. 
This session aims to gather the scientific community interested in 
various aspects of planetary body science together with experts in 
planetary formation system. The main focus will be to discuss the 
state-of-the-art of planet/small bodies and solar system formation 
taking into account the recent information coming from observation, 
laboratory investigations and modelling results.

AOGS 2020 SESSION PS13: POLARIZATION IN THE SOLAR SYSTEM AND BEYOND

Please consider submitting an abstract to session PS13 of the AOGS 17th
Annual Meeting that will be held on June 28 - July 4, 2020 in 
Hongcheon, South Korea. See: 

http://www.asiaoceania.org/aogs2020/

The session considers polarization studies of planetary and 
small-bodies atmospheres and surfaces; magnetic fields in Sun and 
space; detection and characterization of exoplanets, brown dwarfs, star
 and planet forming regions; and search for habitability elsewhere. We

COSPAR 2020 SESSION 20-B4.1: MARS SCIENCE RESULTS

Please consider submitting an abstract to the session on Mars science 
results at the 43rd COSPAR Scientific Assembly on August 15-22 in 
Sydney, Australia. There are expected to be three half-day sessions.

Mars has been extensively studied using spacecraft data, theoretical 
modeling, laboratory studies, and comparative planetology over several 
decades. As of the conference, there are expected to be six operating 
orbiters (ODY, MEx, MRO, MAVEN, MOM, and TGO), one operating rover 
(Curiosity), one operating lander (InSight), and more spacecraft on the 
way. These spacecraft are exploring Mars' atmosphere, surface, and 
subsurface to understand the planet's history and habitability. This 
session will address new science resulting from these missions, as well 
as studies reliant on theory, modeling, laboratory studies, and 
comparative planetology. We are very pleased to feature the following 
solicited speakers: Caroline Freissinet, Justin Deighan, Abigail 
Fraeman, Claire Newman, and Katarina Miljkovic.

Abstract deadline: February 14, 2020

2020 CIDER SUMMER PROGRAM

June 28 - July 24, 2020

Earth's Evolution as an Inhabited World

CIDER announces their annual summer program on behalf of the 
geosciences community. This summer program focuses on the evolution of 
physical and chemical conditions that allowed life to gain a foothold. 
This broad program will cover the details of planetary formation and 
the subsequent evolution of this initial state through the early Earth 
and through the onset of plate tectonics. At each stage, we explore 
the interplay between Earth's surface environment and the evolution of 
the interior. The organizers and program committee can be found at: 

https://deep-earth.org/summer20

The program features a 4 week tutorial and research program for about 
40 advanced graduate students and postdocs. We also welcome scientists 
at assistant professor/researcher level (and higher) to participate in 
any part of the program, with a minimum commitment of 2 weeks.

The summer program will be held on the campus of University of 
California, Santa Barbara. It is supported by the NSF/CSEDI program. 
Applications are invited for both senior and junior participate at:

[NASA] ANNOUNCEMENT FOR PLANETARY SCIENCE ADVISORY COMMITTEE 
NOMINATIONS

The Planetary Science Advisory Committee (PAC) supports the advisory 
needs of the Planetary Science Division (PSD), the Science Mission 
Directorate (SMD) and other mission directorates as required, and the 
NASA Administrator. The advisory scope of the PAC includes all aspects 
of NASA's planetary science program, including scientific research;
considerations of the development of near-term enabling technologies, 
systems, and computing and information management capabilities; and 
developments with the potential to provide long-term improvements in 
future mission operational systems.

Responsibility for biological planetary protection is outside the 
purview of the PAC. NASA's PSD is extending the invitation for 
nominations for service on the PAC. Interested members of the community 
are invited to review the charter and to submit nominations (including 
self-nominations) for consideration to fill vacancies on the Committee.

SUMMER EXPLORATION INTERNSHIP PROGRAM

The Summer Exploration Internship Program is a new initiative of the 
Institute for Earth and Space Exploration at the University of Western 
Ontario, Canada: 

http://space.uwo.ca 

This program will provide undergraduate students with an opportunity 
to perform cutting-edge, hands-on research on a range of topics in an 
interdisciplinary environment. Students will work on a combination of 
interdisciplinary team-based research projects and focused individual 
research projects with faculty mentors, with their time divided 
approximately equally between the two. For more information and to 
apply, visit:

THE SMALL BODIES NODE USERS GROUP (THE SMUG)

The Small Bodies Node of the NASA Planetary Data System is constituting 
a users group to represent the interests of the SBN user community, 
test new products, and provide input for the SBN's future development. 
The user group will replace the SBN Advisory Council as its primary 
deliberative user body, and will be comprised of a small number of 
sitting members who will rotate on for staggered, three-year terms, 
with the intention of maintaining a balance of diversity that crosses 
small body related disciplines and levels of career development. The 
group will meet half-days twice per year on the margins of major 
meetings, such as the AAS-DPS and LPSC meetings. Individuals who are 
interested in joining are encouraged to contact gerbsb@umd.edu.
