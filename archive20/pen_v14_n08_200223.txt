POSTDOCTORAL RESEARCH POSITION AT THE LUNAR AND PLANETARY INSTITUTE IN
PLANETARY RADAR

The Lunar and Planetary Institute (LPI) invites applications for a 
Postdoctoral Fellow in Planetary Radar Studies to work with 
Drs. Patrick A. Taylor and Edgard Rivera-Valentin to conduct detailed 
studies of near-Earth objects and planetary surfaces via radar 
observations, data analysis, and modeling. Additionally, the successful 
candidate is expected to carry out an independent research program and 
contribute to public engagement events at the LPI.

Required expertise includes: a recent Ph.D. in planetary science, 
astronomy, physics, geoscience, electrical engineering, or a related 
field, experience in numerical and statistical techniques, proficiency 
in a common astronomy programming language (e.g., IDL, MATLAB, Python), 
and demonstrated knowledge of planetary radar studies. Direct 
experience with radar observations and techniques is strongly desired, 
but not required. Complementary experience with astronomical or Solar 
System observations (e.g., optical or infrared), small-body geophysics, 
or astronomical instrumentation is preferred, but not required.

Applications must include a cover letter, curriculum vitae, statement 
of research interests, and contact information for at least three 
professional references.

Application deadline: February 24, 2020 or until filled

[NASA] DUAL-ANONYMOUS PEER REVIEW VIRTUAL TOWN HALL - MARCH 3, 2020 
 
On March 3, 2020 at 12:30pm Eastern Time, join leadership and division 
representatives from NASA's Science Mission Directorate for a virtual 
community Town Hall. The Town Hall will discuss a pilot study to 
implement dual-anonymous peer review for four programs in ROSES-2020. 
Under this system, not only are proposers unaware of the identity of 
reviewers, but the reviewers do not have explicit knowledge of the 
proposing teams and institutions during the scientific evaluation of 
the proposal.

The four ROSES-2020 programs that will be evaluated using 
dual-anonymous peer review are:

A.30 Earth Science U.S. Participating Investigator
B.4 Heliophysics Guest Investigators-Open (Step-1 and Step-2 proposals 
will be anonymized)
D.2 Astrophysics Data Analysis (ADAP)
E.4 Habitable Worlds (only Step-2 proposals will be anonymized)

In advance of the SMD Town Hall, questions may be submitted and upvoted 
on at:

https://arc.cnf.io/sessions/qg98/#!/dashboard

The Town Hall will be broadcast live via WebEx. Connection details 
follow:

Meeting password: Smddapr2020!

Audio-only participation is available by calling +1-415-527-5035 and 
providing access code 901 604 462.

[NASA] PDS: MRO SHARAD RDRS FOR RELEASES 36-47

MRO SHARAD derived data from the ASI (Italian Space Agency) SHARAD 
Ground Operations Center have been released covering the period 
May 17, 2015 to April 20, 2018. These time periods correspond to 
previous MRO releases 36-47. The SHARAD team is recovering data from 
deliveries that were missed due to a hiatus in ground operations 
between June 2012 and March 2013. For details, see the file ERRATA.TXT 
on the archive volume at:

https://pds-geosciences.wustl.edu/mro/mro-m-sharad-4-rdr-v1/mrosh_1004

[NASA] PDS: MERCURY MESSENGER DERIVED GRAVITY MODEL

A new Mercury gravity model derived from MESSENGER radio science data 
has been released to PDS by the JPL Gravity Science Team. The data 
product contains the covariance matrix and related data for the JPL 
Mercury gravity field MESS160A, a 160th degree and order spherical 
harmonic model. It is the first archived JPL gravity field that 
includes MESSENGER tracking data. Two versions are provided, one with 
the full covariance matrix and one with the covariance matrix truncated 
to degree 50.

The data are available from:

2020 ASTROBIOLOGY GRADUATE CONFERENCE

On September 14-18, 2020, the NASA Astrobiology Graduate Conference 
(AbGradCon) will be hosted at ELSI (Earth-Life Science Institute) in 
Tokyo, Japan. AbGradCon is an annual conference specifically for 
graduate students and early-career postdocs, organized and executed by 
graduate students and early-career postdocs, who study the diverse 
topics encompassing the field of astrobiology. 

The application deadline is March 15, 2020 and we also expect to 
secure some travel funds for young researchers around the world. If 
you are interested, the website and application can be found at: 

http://abgradcon.org

This year is the first time AbGradCo will be held in Asia, and the 
conference's main theme will be international collaboration. We hope 
to have representation from all regions of the world, but especially 
from Asia and Oceania We plan to have career development events such as 
a science communication workshop, a career panel, keynote speakers by 
leaders in the field, and field excursions to various related research 
centers around the Tokyo area.

STARS AND PLANETS IN THE ULTRAVIOLET: A CROSS-COMMUNITY SYMPOSIUM

Symposium Rationale:

Ultraviolet (UV) photons are diagnostic of many stellar and planetary 
processes, including system formation, planet atmospheres, 
habitability, stellar activity, and star-planet interactions. With 
very limited access to UV observations of exoplanetary systems, it is 
time to bring the exoplanet, stellar and solar-system communities 
together to discuss the state of knowledge, identify the missing 
information, and plan the instrumentation needed for future space-based 
UV observatories. 

Symposium Dates: May 4-6, 2020 
Location: Arizona State University, Tempe, Arizona
Registration and Abstract Deadline: March 10, 2020

MER DATA CATALOG SURVEY

The goal of the Mars Exploration Rovers (MER) Data Catalog Project is 
to make it easy and simple for researchers who were not members of the 
MER team (as well as the general public) to discover and use Spirit and
Opportunity data. We are conducting a survey to find out what features
potential users would like to see in the catalog. We would appreciate
it if you would take the survey, which should take ~5-10 minutes, by
going to:

http://www.merdatacatalog.com/survey

In addition to completing the survey yourself, please pass the link on
to anyone who might want to use MER data. We're hoping to hear from
Mars-focused and non-Mars-focused planetary scientists, Earth
scientists, high school teachers, undergraduates, engineers, museum
workers, and anyone at all who might be interested in working with MER
data.

Conducting a survey constitutes experimenting on humans, so we have
sought and received approval for the survey from Cornell University's
Institutional Review Board (IRB) Office. The survey does not collect
any identifying information, and all data will be presented in
aggregate. It will be open through April 2020; we will present interim
results collected by February 29th 2020 at LPSC.

ISIS REQUEST FOR COMMENT 5 POSTED

Request for Comment 5 (RFC5) concerning the removal of outdated 
LOLAGRAIL SPK kernels from the ISIS data area has been posted at: 

http://bit.ly/isisrfc5 

Users working with lunar data in ISIS are likely impacted by the 
proposed change. Please see the linked RFC and associated GitHub post 
to participate in the discussion and learn about the potential impact.
