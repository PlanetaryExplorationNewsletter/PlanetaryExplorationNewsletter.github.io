THE 6TH INTERNATIONAL PLANETARY DUNES WORKSHOP GOES VIRTUAL

In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the 6th International Planetary
Dunes Workshop is going virtual. The revised dates are: May 12-13,
2020. The focus will be white papers and white paper concepts. Day 1
will be contributed science talks with a focus on the Decadal and day 2
will be a series of white paper presentations with extended
discussions. Registration is open and free but you must register to get
the virtual meeting pass code. More information can be found at:

https://www.hou.usra.edu/meetings/dunes2020/

INSTRUMENT SCIENTIST AT NASA GSFC
 
The Planetary Environments Lab (PEL) at NASA's Goddard Space Flight
Center, is seeking an instrument scientist, with an emphasis on mass
spectrometry, for a civil servant position opening. The candidate must
have expertise in a variety of mass spectrometry techniques, with
experience in the development, testing, and implementation of current
and next generation mass spectrometer techniques. The PEL has developed
mass spectrometers and sampling systems for a variety of planetary
missions, including: Sample Analysis at Mars (SAM) on the Curiosity
rover, MOMA on the ExoMars rover, MAVEN NGIMS, Cassini-Huygens GCMS,
Cassini INMS, LADEE NMS, and is presently developing mass spectrometers
for lunar missions and the mass spectrometer on the Dragonfly mission
to Titan.

Application Process

A full vacancy announcement, which contains further information
including qualification requirements and application instructions, will
be posted on May 18 to:

https://www.usajobs.gov/

and remain open for five days. The short period that the announcement
is open is due to the type of hiring authority, and is not a reflection
of the openness of the position.

Questions may be directed to the Chief of the Planetary Environments
Lab: Charles Malespin, charles.a.malespin@nasa.gov.

UPDATE FOR ASTROBIOLOGY2020

Registration for Astrobiology2020 and the Early Earth workshop remains
closed until July 1 to allow more time for monitoring of the
coronavirus pandemic. The organizing committee thus remains cautiously
optimistic that we can beat the pandemic and hold a successful
conference in November. Please revisit the Registration site on July 1
for an update on whether this meeting will go ahead as planned.

WRITING WHITE PAPERS FOR THE DECADAL SURVEY ON PLANETARY SCIENCE AND
ASTROBIOLOGY: WEBINAR FOR EARLY CAREER PROFESSIONALS

The National Academies' Decadal Survey on Planetary Science and
Astrobiology:

https://www.nationalacademies.org/our-work/planetary-science-and-astrobiology-decadal-survey-2023-2032

will assess key scientific questions in planetary science
and astrobiology, identify priority medium- and large-class missions
and other initiatives, and present a comprehensive research strategy
for the 2023-2032 timeframe. Community participation is critical for
the success of the survey, and we invite early career professionals to
join us for a webinar on how to write and submit white papers to the
decadal survey:

https://www.eventbrite.com/e/writing-white-papers-for-the-decadal-survey-on-planetary-science-and-astrobiology-registration-103339629614

on May 7, 2020 from 1:30-3:00pm ET (10:30am-12:00pm PT).

The webinar will feature a keynote presentation from Dr. Phil
Christensen of Arizona State University, a panel session with invited
speakers, and a Q&A session with the audience. Speakers will discuss
their experiences with writing and submitting white papers for past
decadal surveys, and how white papers are reviewed during panel
deliberations. While this event is designed for early career
professionals, everyone who wants to learn more about the white paper
submission process is welcome to attend. If you have further questions
about the event, please contact Mia Brown at mbrown@nas.edu.

NASA PLANETARY DATA SYSTEM (PDS) ANNUAL CUSTOMER SATISFACTION SURVEY
2020 EXTENDED DUE TO PANDEMIC

NASA's PDS customer satisfaction survey of the Planetary Data System
(PDS) remains open to ensure the widest response possible. This survey
will be used to set priorities for the PDS and identify areas for
improvement. In particular, the survey includes specific questions to
determine user experience with search tools and web services that will
be invaluable to the PDS discipline nodes for improving their services.

The survey is available at the following link:

https://feedback.app.cfigroup.com/l/r/NASAPDSGen 

This survey link may also be posted to any website.

Your support in helping to improve the PDS is greatly appreciated.
Please contact the PDS at pds-operator@jpl.nasa.gov with questions on
the survey.

4TH COSPAR MEETING ON REFINING PLANETARY PROTECTION REQUIREMENTS FOR
HUMAN MISSIONS TO MARS

19-20 May 2020

This meeting series is to address knowledge gaps in planetary
protection in the timeframe between now and the first crewed flight to
the Martian surface. The meeting output will feed into subsequent
COSPAR reporting on this topic. The 2020 meeting is on "Technology and
operations for contamination control" and will be in two parts: a
virtual meeting on 19-20 May (~4hr programs on each day, starting at
9:00am EDT) followed by an in-person meeting on TBD date. Day one of
the virtual meeting, to be held via WEBEX, will present updates in
planetary protection and spaceflight programs, and an overview of
workshop findings to date. Day two will focus on spacecraft hardware
and operations technologies, particularly emphasizing the interface
between hardware performance and contamination control/planetary
protection issues.
