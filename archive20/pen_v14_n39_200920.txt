[NASA] PDS: LUNAR RECONNAISSANCE ORBITER DATA RELEASE 43

The NASA Planetary Data System announces Release 43 of data from the 
Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter mission. This release contains raw and 
calibrated data products covering the nominal time period from 
March 15, 2020, through June 14, 2020.

Some instrument teams are delivering more recent data. The data are 
archived at various PDS nodes:

CRaTER at the PPI Node
Diviner at the Geosciences Node
LAMP at the Cartography and Imaging Sciences Node
LEND at the Geosciences Node
LOLA at the Geosciences Node
LROC at the LROC Data Node
Mini-RF at the Geosciences Node
Radio Science at the Geosciences Node
SPICE at the NAIF Node

LROC RDRs will be available soon, though its EDRs and CDRs are ready.

To access the above data by dataset, please visit:

https://pds.nasa.gov/datasearch/subscription-service/SS-20200915.shtml

All data for LRO may be accessed from:

https://pds-geosciences.wustl.edu/missions/lro/

LRO releases occur every three months. The next release is scheduled 
for December 15, 2020.

MACHINE LEARNING FOR PLANETARY SPACE PHYSICS (ML4PSP) SERIES

We want to extend an invitation to participate in a new seminar series 
and community building effort in machine learning for planetary science 
and space physics (ML4PSP). Our inaugural seminar will be on September 
22, 2020 at 9 AM PST / 12 PM EST where we will have introductions to 
the series by the seminar organizers (Abby Azari & Caitriona Jackman) 
before hearing from Dr. Matthew James on a machine learning generated 
3D model of Mercury's magnetosphere using the MESSENGER FIPS proton 
moments.

ML4PSP will meet monthly with two speakers per seminar. Topics will 
primarily focus on intersections in machine learning, planetary 
science, and space physics. We welcome presentations in adjacent 
topics including Earth applied methods, data science education, and 
basic machine learning research.

our listserv and community at:

[NASA] SMALL INNOVATIVE MISSIONS FOR PLANETARY EXPLORATION (SIMPLEX) 
OPPORTUNITY DELAYED

The next Small Innovative Missions for Planetary Exploration (SIMPLEx) 
Opportunity is delayed with no new release date available at this time. 

PSD remains committed to the goals of the SIMPLEx program, but several 
factors require this delay. First, we have important existing 
commitments that are of high priority based on the Decadal Survey that 
we are working under. The inefficiencies related to COVID-19 only 
enhance the pressure on our budget. Second, we are still learning from 
this current round of selected SIMPLEx missions. Consistent with our 
previous comments on these issues, we want to incorporate lessons from 
these missions, including solicited feedback from the community, into 
our approaches before starting the process for the next AO. In 
particular, SMD needs to take stock of the procedures for selecting, 
managing, and matching rideshare missions to primary missions so that 
we maximize the opportunity for rideshare mission success. This delay 
will allow NASA to communicate with various stakeholders to ensure 
alignment going forward.

PSD has asked the Decadal Survey for guidance on the future of the 
SIMPLEx Program balanced with other priorities.

Sincerely,

Lori S. Glaze, Ph.D.
Director, Planetary Science Division 
NASA

THE DPS INVITES APPLICATIONS TO NEW FUND FOR UNDERREPRESENTED MINORITY 
COMMUNITIES IN PLANETARY SCIENCE

The DPS is offering funds to encourage and support participation of 
students, scientists, and other space professionals who are members of 
underrepresented racial and ethnic groups. In partnership with the 
National Society of Black Physicists (NSBP), awards are available for 
members of Black/African American, Indigenous, and/or Latinx 
communities to support attendance at the annual DPS meeting and/or the 
annual NSBP meeting. The fund is intended to support some travel (when 
meetings are in person and not virtual) and meeting registration fees, 
and applicants may also request coverage for society membership fees.

Please see this link to apply; the application deadline is October 13, 
2020:

THE LUNAR SURFACE INNOVATION CONSORTIUM - VIRTUAL FALL MEETING

The Lunar Surface Innovation Consortium (LSIC) Fall Meeting will be 
held virtually on October 14-15, 2020. It will feature keynote 
addresses, working sessions, and technical poster presentations. A 
preliminary agenda is posted at: 

http://lsic.jhuapl.edu/Events/102.php?id=102 

It will be updated as additional detail are finalized. The event will 
center on the interrelationships between the six LSIC focus areas, 
especially in the context of surface power. The six LSIC technical 
focus areas are:

 Dust Mitigation
 Excavation & Construction
 Extreme Access
 Extreme Environments
 In Situ Resource Utilization
 Surface Power

Other topics of interest include defining the parameters and 
constraints of the architecture required to support a sustained 
presence on the lunar surface, as well as economic and policy 
considerations. Early registration closes at 11:59PM EDT on 
September 19, 2020 and will help the registration committee 
determine which discussion groups participants get placed into.
