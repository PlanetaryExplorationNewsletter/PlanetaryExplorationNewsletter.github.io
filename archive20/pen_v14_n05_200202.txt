COSPAR SESSION B0.4: TECHNOLOGIES FOR PLANETARY RESEARCH

43rd COSPAR Scientific Assembly 
Sydney, Australia 
August 15-23, 2020

To accomplish the goals of Planetary research in the next decade more 
complex missions, instruments, and space vehicles are being envisioned. 
In addition, the advent of disruptive technologies such as Autonomy and 
CubeSats/SmallSats brings new opportunities to achieve scientific 
discoveries previously considered out of reach. This session explores 
diverse technologies that can enable new instruments and missions that 
survive and operate in extreme environments from the Moon to the inner 
and outer reaches of the Solar System, enable swarms of spacecraft to 
collect scientific data throughout our Solar System, drill through ice, 
determine if life is present on planetary bodies, increase data rates 
from distant bodies and much more.

Abstract deadline: February 14, 2020

BEYOND

Please consider submitting an abstract to the Ocean Worlds Session at 
the 43rd COSPAR Scientific Assembly on August 15-22 in Sydney, 
Australia.

Solar System exploration stands on a precipice, offering the 
opportunity to search for signs of life in one or more of the ocean 
worlds of the Outer Solar System in the coming decades. This event 
welcomes papers describing one or more of the confirmed or potential 
ocean worlds that harbor subsurface oceans of liquid water and/or, for 
Saturn's moon Titan, surface reservoirs of liquid hydrocarbon and 
solid organics. These bodies represent targets for future standalone 
and cooperative missions led by the major space agencies in the quest 
to understand the potential for life in the Solar System. Submissions 
that describe new observations of ocean properties, stimulate/describe 
future observations, or review our current state of knowledge are 
encouraged. We also welcome laboratory investigations and future 
mission plans that could extend our understanding of the habitability 
of the outer Solar System. Presentations will include a mix of 
solicited and contributed papers.

GOLDSCHMIDT SESSION 14G: WEATHERING - LONG-TERM TERRESTRIAL CLIMATE
CHANGE, MODERN QUANTIFICATION, AND IMPLICATIONS FOR EXTRATERRESTRIAL
ENVIRONMENTS

Please consider submitting an abstract to our session at the 
Goldschmidt 2020 conference to be held on June 21-26 in Honolulu.

Abstracts are due by midnight February 14 (Hawaii Standard Time).

We seek contributions from three main areas: (1) Quantification and 
understanding of modern weathering regimes, with connections to 
terrestrial soil and marine sediment formation, the impact of local 
lithology (e.g., basaltic volcanic arcs vs. siliciclastic river deltas) 
on weathering rates and chemistry, and changes as a result of 
anthropogenic activities. (2) Connections between silicate weathering, 
Severse weathering, and climate change on various timescales, e.g., 
glacial-interglacial cycles of the late Pleistocene, long-term changes 
over the Cenozoic, or early Earth/Archean, and how these changes are 
being constrained from geologic records (i.e., isotopic tracers of 
weathering). (3) Understanding weathering, fluid/rock interaction, 
and/or soil formation regimes in extraterrestrial environments (e.g., 
Mars and Titan), and how these processes may be related to climate and 
hydrology, habitability, and respective evolution through time.

For more information, and to submit an abstract, please go to:

GOLDSCHMIDT SESSION 1B: FROM ABIOTIC TO BIOTIC - EXPLORING THE POSSIBLE 
(BIO)GEOCHEMISTRY OF A HABITABLE MARS

Abstract deadline is February 14:

https://goldschmidt.info/2020

Geochemical evidence from meteorites and spacecraft have revealed that 
from its earliest history, Mars has hosted potentially habitable 
environments and a diverse organic chemical inventory. These 
observations have enabled a paradigm shift in our understanding of 
Martian carbon geochemistry and how that might relate to the emergence 
and persistence of life of Mars. With a potential Mars sample return on 
the horizon, renewed global effort is warranted to integrate current 
and emerging knowledge on the evolution of Mars, its capacity to 
support life, the conditions required for life's emergence, and 
advanced geochemical approaches to yield accurate records of planetary 
conditions including the potential role of abiotic reactions and 
possibly biology in elemental cycles. By understanding these cycles and 
setting an abiotic background, robust hypotheses can be developed to 
test for evidence of Martian life if it ever existed. We invite 
submissions that address mission, laboratory, analog, and experimental 
efforts to inform hypotheses on abiotic or biotic influences on Mars 
and their impact on geochemical cycling of biogenic elements, 
especially carbon.

impact on the binary's moon, has been approved by ESA Member States in 
November 2019 in the new Space Safety Program for launch in 2024.

The main objective of the workshop is to present and discuss current 
status of the ongoing activities in support and preparation to the Hera 
mission. It also offers the small body community the possibility to 
discuss possible contributions to the different working groups that 
have been defined to support the mission development and data 
interpretation.

The venue is the Hotel Saint-Paul in Nice and a block of bedrooms has 
been kept for participants. A form can be downloaded on the workshop 
website to book a bedroom at preferential rate (deadline on 
February 16, 2020).

See:  

https://www.cosmos.esa.int/web/hera-community-workshop

MER DATA CATALOG SURVEY

The goal of the Mars Exploration Rovers (MER) Data Catalog Project is 
to make it easy and simple for researchers who were not members of the 
MER team (as well as the general public) to discover and use Spirit and
Opportunity data. We are conducting a survey to find out what features
potential users would like to see in the catalog. We would appreciate
it if you would take the survey, which should take ~5-10 minutes, by
going to:

http://www.merdatacatalog.com/survey

In addition to completing the survey yourself, please pass the link on
to anyone who might want to use MER data. We're hoping to hear from
Mars-focused and non-Mars-focused planetary scientists, Earth
scientists, high school teachers, undergraduates, engineers, museum
workers, and anyone at all who might be interested in working with MER
data.

Conducting a survey constitutes experimenting on humans, so we have
sought and received approval for the survey from Cornell University's
Institutional Review Board (IRB) Office. The survey does not collect
any identifying information, and all data will be presented in
aggregate. It will be open through April 2020; we will present interim
results collected by February 29th 2020 at LPSC.

NASA PLANETARY DATA SYSTEM (PDS) DATA RELEASE CALENDAR 2020 NOW POSTED

The Planetary Data System (PDS) has posted its Data Release Calendar 
for 2020 at:

https://pds.nasa.gov/datasearch/subscription-service
/data-release-calendar.shtml

The PDS Data Release Calendar is a searchable and sortable table of 
important dates associated with all PDS data releases in the current 
calendar year. The calendar includes anticipated release dates for 
mission data, actual release dates updated as they occur, and links 
to pages for more information and to download the data. Users can use 
the calendar to determine which data are acceptable for use in NASA 
ROSES proposals. However, the final authority on data acceptability for 
any ROSES opportunity rests with the designated Program Officer for 
that opportunity as identified in the ROSES call.

WORKSHOP: OBSERVATORY FOR THE OUTER HELIOSPHERE, HELIOSHEATH, AND 
INTERSTELLAR SPACE

Thursday, Friday, May 21-22, 2020
LASP-SPSC, University of Colorado, Boulder

With both Voyager spacecraft in interstellar space, the IBEX and the 
upcoming IMAP missions imaging the outer boundaries of the heliosphere, 
and New Horizons in the outer heliosphere, it is an ideal time to 
combine resources from these missions and modeling efforts. This 
workshop seeks input aimed at developing plans to maximize the use of 
these observations and their comparison to models, plus plan any 
operational changes that can maximize the return from these missions.

BOOK: ASTRONOMY

Senior Contributing Authors
Andrew Fraknoi, Foothill College
David Morrison, NASA Ames Research Center
Sidney C. Wolff, National Optical Astronomy Observatory

Astronomy is designed to meet the scope and sequence requirements of 
one- or two-semester introductory astronomy courses. The book begins 
with relevant scientific fundamentals and progresses through an 
exploration of the Solar System, stars, galaxies, and cosmology. The 
Astronomy textbook builds student understanding through the use of 
relevant analogies, clear and non-technical explanations, and rich 
illustrations. Mathematics is included in a flexible manner to meet 
the needs of individual instructors.

This is published by the non-profit OpenStax project at Rice 
University (part of a national program to reduce college costs), has 
now had over 300,000 readers, and has been adopted in more than 700 
institutions. A new library of 1,100 multiple-choice questions is now 
available to adopters, and a free open-resource hub has over 30 helpful 
ancillary materials. A new app makes free downloading on phones and 
tablets easier. Paper copies of the book are available for $58.
