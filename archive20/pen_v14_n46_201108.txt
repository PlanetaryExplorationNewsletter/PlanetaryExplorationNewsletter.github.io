FIRST MERCURY SCIENCE AND EXPLORATION NEWSLETTER RELEASED

The Mercury Exploration Assessment Group (MExAG) is circulating the
first issue of "The Mercury Newsletter." This new quarterly community
newsletter can be accessed online at:

https://www.lpi.usra.edu/mexag/newsletter/

In this newsletter, we introduce MExAG and its Steering Committee and
highlight Mercury science news and upcoming meetings.

Please send your Mercury community announcements and calendar items for
inclusion in the newsletter to the MExAG Steering Committee at

[NASA] ROSES-20: PAYLOADS AND RESEARCH INVESTIGATIONS ON THE SURFACE OF
THE MOON (PRISM)

The Payloads and Research Investigations on the Surface of the Moon
(PRISM) program element solicits proposals for investigations that
include development and flight of science-driven suites of instruments
and technology demonstration payloads that will be delivered to the
lunar surface on Commercial Lunar Payload Services (CLPS). This PRISM
solicitation calls for science investigations that will be delivered to
the lunar surface in late Calendar Year (CY) 2023 and early CY2024 to
predetermined lunar landing sites. These deliveries will go to Reiner
Gamma (a lunar swirl) in Quarter 4 2023, and a Schroedinger Basin
impact melt (lunar far side) in Quarter 2 2024. Proposals must identify
one of these lunar landing sites and propose an investigation uniquely
achieved at that location. No other landing sites shall be proposed.
Some technology development and maturation within the proposed project
is allowed, but the primary review criteria for selection are the merit
of the proposed science investigation and ability to deliver on
schedule.

Mandatory Step-1 Proposals: December 11, 2020
Step-2 proposals: January 19, 2021

[NASA] ADVANCE NOTICE REGARDING NEW FRONTIERS 5 (NF5) ANNOUNCEMENT OF
OPPORTUNITY
 
NASA has recently released a community announcement sharing some draft
policies under consideration for the New Frontiers 5 AO. These draft
policies are being shared in order to provide the opportunity for the
community to give feedback to NASA. This feedback will be considered by
NASA as part of the ongoing AO preparation process to revise these and
other policies. The announcement is available at

https://newfrontiers.larc.nasa.gov/NF5/

Questions and feedback on the draft policies in the notice are due by
February 19, 2021, and may be addressed to Dr. Curt Niebur, New
Frontiers Program Lead Scientist, Planetary Science Division, Science
Mission Directorate, NASA, Washington, DC 20546; Tel.: (202) 358-0390;
Email: curt.niebur@nasa.gov.

[NASA] FUNDAMENTAL PHYSICS PROGRAM VIRTUAL TOWNHALL

The Fundamental Physics program of NASA's Biological and Physical
Sciences (BPS) Division will be conducting a virtual townhall on
December 3, 2020, to discuss research foci and potential mission
candidates in preparation for consideration in the upcoming BPS Decadal
Survey, which will establish research priorities and help determine the
future BPS (and Fundamental Physics) scope and funding for the decade
starting in 2023. In order to achieve a high priority for Fundamental
Physics research and ensure its future healthy growth, it is important
that the fundamental physics community, researchers, theorists,
technologists, as well as industrial partners, participate in a strong
and meaningful way in this activity.

Specific topical areas currently expected to be discussed in the
townhall are:
 
* Cold Atom Physics
* Quantum Entanglement
* Optical Clock-Based Experiments
* Direct Detection of Dark Energy
* Dusty Plasma Physics Experiments on the Moon
* Complex/Dusty Plasma Physics on the International Space Station
* Other Space Fundamental Physics Research
 
We welcome and strongly encourage interested scientists, researchers,
and industrial partners to participate in the townhall and the decadal
survey activities.
