[NASA] COVID SALARY FLEXIBILITY EXTENSION FOR NASA SMD GRANTS

Until recently, government-wide rules (e.g., in OMB memo M-20-26)
allowed recipients of grants and cooperative agreements the flexibility
to pay salaries and benefits of participants who could not work because
of COVID-19 (e.g., because they could not get into a necessary facility
closed due to COVID-19). Because the government-wide flexibility in OMB
memo M-20-26 ended on 9/30/20, NASA has issued Grant Notice 20-02
allowing us, on a case-by-case basis, to extend this flexibility so
grantees may continue to pay salaries. NASA's Science Mission
Directorate has created a web page to host Grant Notice 20-02, provide
information about COVID and grants and, at the bottom of that page, an
easy way for grantees to request an extension of the now expired
flexibility so PIs may (with approval from their organization) continue
to pay salaries of participants who cannot work because of COVID-19.

GRAM SUITE VERSION 1.1 RELEASED

The Global Reference Atmospheric Model (GRAM) Suite is an
engineering-oriented atmospheric model that estimates mean values and
statistical variations of atmospheric properties for planetary
destinations. GRAM outputs include atmospheric density, temperature,
pressure, winds, and chemical composition along a user-defined path. 
The GRAMs have been rearchitected from Fortran to a common
object-oriented C++ framework. This new architecture creates a common
GRAM library of data models and utilities. Version 1.1 of the GRAM
Suite contains the rearchitected Neptune-GRAM and Titan-GRAM. GRAM
Suite Version 1.1 is now available upon request through the NASA
Software Catalog at: 

https://software.nasa.gov/software/MFS-33888-1

NEW PORTALS FOR BENNU AND RYUGU

NASA's Solar System Treks Project

https://trek.nasa.gov

is pleased to announce the release of two additions to its family of 
online planetary data visualization and analysis portals.

Bennu Trek

https://trek.nasa.gov/bennu

provides visualization and dissemination of mission data from the
near-Earth asteroid Bennu. This initial release features the PolyCam
5cm Global Mosaic as basemap and uses the PolyCam DEM for representing
elevation data. Additional data products include rock abundance and
slope maps. In addition to standard global, polar, and 3D projection
views, Bennu Trek features a 3D Model view providing optimized
visualization of features exhibiting topological overhangs. Two guided
tours provide detailed views and descriptions of areas of special
interest.

Ryugu Trek

https://trek.nasa.gov/ryugu

provides visualization and dissemination of data from the Hayabusa2
mission. The initial release features the Optical Navigation Camera
Telescopic Camera (ONC-T) Global Mosaic as basemap and utilizes the
ONC-T DEM for elevation data. Users can access, visualize, analyze, and
download numerous individual I/F (or radiance factor) ONC-T frames
taken during the 2018-08-01 orbit, during which Hayabusa2 was about 5
km above the surface of Ryugu.

MARS: HRSC DTM AND ORTHOIMAGES OF THE SYRTIS MAJOR QUADRANGLE

The Global Topography and Mosaics Group of the ESA Mars Express HRSC
(High- Resolution Stereo Camera) science team has generated the HRSC
Mars Chart (HMC-30) products for the MC-13E quadrangle of Mars (Syrtis
Major, East). This includes a Digital Terrain Model (DTM, 50 m grid)
and ortho-rectified image mosaics (up to 12.5 m/pixel) from
bundle-block adjusted HRSC images. The products provide regional
context and basemaps for the Mars2020 Perseverance landing site. They
are adjusted to the global MOLA dataset and therefore can also be
applied as reference data for co-registering other high-resolution
datasets. HMC products for other Mars quadrangles are currently
available for MC-11E, MC-11W (Oxia Palus), and MC-20E (Sinus Sabaeus).

The products are available to the scientific community and the Mars
2020 team to support scientific investigations. Release of the data
products through PSA is currently in preparation. The products have
been generated by the DLR Institute of Planetary Research, Freie
Universitat Berlin, and Leibniz Universitat Hannover and can be
visualized using a mapserver:

https://maps.planet.fu-berlin.de

Downloads are possible through this mapserver or directly from the
HMC-30 website at DLR:

The registration deadline Oct 12, 2020, at 11:59 PM EDT. For the poster
session, we are taking a two-fold approach: providing posters for
asynchronous viewing and comments through our website, and then during
the meeting, hosting a virtual poster session through the Gather Town
software. Gather runs in a browser, and allows regional mingling, much
like a real meeting would. To try to mitigate member stress, we will
offer demo sessions and a user guide in advance of the meeting.
