TOE3 CONFERENCE: FROM SOLAR SYSTEM TO EXOPLANETS, POSTPONED

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic and its global impact, we sadly decided to
postpone the conference "TOE3: From Solar System to Exoplanets"
originally scheduled for June 1-5 2020 in Lamego, Portugal.

Due to the high number of conferences that have been and will be
postponed, we have not decided on the new date yet. We will inform you
as soon as possible.

Best wishes & stay safe,
The LOC of the TOE3 conference.

COMMITTEE OPPORTUNITY AVAILABLE: MARS SAMPLE RETURN SCIENCE PLANNING
GROUP PHASE 2

Dear MEPAG Community,

NASA and ESA invite individuals to apply for membership in a new Mars

and managing large-scale collaborative scientific activities,
involvement in one or more sample return planning and/or flight
activities, and experience with sample-related scientific issues
associated with sample containment and analyses. Application for
membership in this committee will be in the form of a Letter of
Application (2 pages), accompanied by a current CV. For more
information please see the Announcement of Opportunity:

[NASA] ROSES-20: INTERDISCIPLINARY SCIENCE FOR ECLIPSE NOT SOLICITED
 
The intention of the Interdisciplinary Science for Eclipse program
element was to support research applied to the total solar eclipse
visible on from the southern hemisphere and partial eclipse visible
from some regions in southern South America, south-west Africa, and
Antarctica.

However, the successful implementation of this program would require
extensive logistics (aircraft to host experiments, site visits,
international agreements) be in place soon, in face of the ongoing
COVID-19 pandemic. Out of concern for the health and safety of the
international science community, we are cancelling the
Interdisciplinary Science for Eclipse ROSES-2020 element. NASA intends
to support research on eclipses in the future.

Opportunities in Space and Earth Sciences (ROSES) 2020" (NNH20ZDA001N)

[NASA] ROSES-20: C.16 DUE DATES DELAYED FOR LABORATORY ANALYSIS OF
RETURNED SAMPLES
 
The goal of the Laboratory Analysis of Returned Samples (LARS) program
is to maximize the science derived from planetary sample-return
missions. Activities supported by LARS fall into two categories: (1)
development of laboratory instrumentation and/or advanced techniques
required for the analysis of returned samples; (2) direct analysis of
samples already returned to Earth. Proposals may fall into either
category or contain tasks that do both.

ROSES-2020 Amendment 14 delays the due dates for LARS. Step-1 proposals
are now due May 15, 2020, and Step-2 proposals are now due July 14,
2020.

This Amendment to the NASA Research Announcement "Research
Opportunities in Space and Earth Sciences (ROSES) 2020" (NNH20ZDA001N)

POSTDOCTORAL FELLOW POSITION AT THE JET PROPULSION LABORATORY
 
The Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) invites applications for a
Postdoctoral Fellow to work with Dr. Catherine Elder to study lunar
surface processes using a combination of thermal modeling and
observations by the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) Diviner Lunar
Radiometer Experiment (Diviner). Diviner observations can constrain the
material properties of the lunar surface and shallow subsurface which
leads to a better understanding of the geologic history of the Moon.
Topics of particular interest include volcanism, regolith formation and
evolution, and impact processes.

Candidates should have a recent Ph.D. in planetary science, physics,
geology, or a related field. Candidates should have experience with
numerical modeling and a strong background in physics. Experience using
remote sensing data is preferred but not required. Candidates who have
received their Ph.D. within the past five years since the date of their
application are eligible.

CALL FOR PAPERS: LANDED LUNAR MISSION CONCEPTS AND HIGH-PRIORITY
LANDING SITES

Announcing a call for papers to a Focus Issue in the Planetary Science
Journal dedicated to papers highlighting Landed Lunar Mission Concepts
and High-Priority Landing Sites.
 
Submission Deadline: August 1, 2020.
 
This special issue is dedicated to papers highlighting lunar mission
concepts, data analysis, and high-priority landing sites. A successful
paper should bring together elements of lunar data analysis (e.g.
geology, site selection, new analyses), along with a lunar mission or
instrument/payload concept (science, instrumentation, mission design,
etc). Surface mission concepts should contain a science justification
for a robotic (or human-assisted) mission, and a detailed analysis of
one or more candidate landing sites to show the existence of a safe and
interesting potential site for the mission. Orbital mission concepts
should include new or updated lunar data analysis or interpretation
that supports the mission concept along with its science justification.
Mission concepts need not be highly mature, but should clearly describe
the science case. 
 
Please direct questions to the Special Issue Coordinators: Barbara
Cohen (Barbara.A.Cohen@nasa.gov) and Maria Banks
(maria.e.banks@nasa.gov).

Planetary Science Journal submission site: 

https://journals.aas.org/planetary-science-journal

When submitting, please indicate the special issue: "Lunar Mission
Concepts and High-Priority Landing Sites" in the comments section.

IMPORTANT ANNOUNCEMENTS FOR THE MEPAG 38 MEETING
 
In preparation for MEPAG Meeting 38 (April 15-17, 2020), please read
the following, test your system, and let us know ASAP if you run into
difficulties:

https://mepag.jpl.nasa.gov/meetings.cfm?expand=m38

1) Due to concerns about random disruptors of virtual meetings and
updated NASA policy regarding allowable virtual meeting platforms, we
plan to conduct this meeting on Adobe Connect (AC), supported by
SSERVI.

* While you can run Adobe Connect through a web browser and do not need
  to install the Adobe Connect add-in/Platform to attend a meeting, we
  have learned that blocked ports and other security settings may 
  prevent connection via browser. We strongly encourage all Mars 
  community attendees to (1) test their system (see website) and 
  (2) access the meeting early.

* If you try the diagnostic check/some trouble-shooting and still can't
  connect, please let us know by 11am PDT Monday, April 13:
  
  https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfSZjL2SeqNxIQkWAddUwnYgpnY_F5xK3ew57oK8fliDs-zVg/viewform
  
  so we can consider mitigation strategies such as updates to the
  posted instructions.

2) Updated meeting website has:

* Brief .pdfs describing planned community-based white paper topics.

* The agenda is ~final.

2020 NASA PLANETARY SCIENCE SUMMER SCHOOL (PSSS) APPLICATIONS CLOSING

Applications are due April 13 for NASA's 32nd Annual PSSS, offered by
the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California. This 3-month
early career development experience teaches the development of a
hypothesis-driven robotic space mission in a concurrent engineering
environment.

Science and engineering doctoral candidates, recent Ph.D.s, postdocs,
and junior faculty, who are U.S. Citizens or legal permanent residents
(and a very limited number of Foreign Nationals from non-designated
counties), are eligible.
 
Session 1: May 18-Jul 24
Session 2: May 18-Aug 7

Roughly equivalent in workload to a rigorous 3-hour graduate-level
course, participants spend the first 10 weeks in preparatory webinars
as a "science mission team", and spend the final culminating week at
JPL being mentored by JPL's Advance Project Design Team, or "Team X" to
refine their planetary science mission concept design, and present it
to a mock expert review board.

Note: As conditions evolve regarding the Covid-19 outbreak, we are
monitoring official recommendations and practices, along with JPL
policy, and developing plans to accommodate potential conditions that
may be present during the week of travel to JPL for each session.
