[NASA] SEEKING VOLUNTEER REVIEWERS IN EARTH AND SPACE SCIENCE

NASA's Science Mission Directorate is seeking subject matter experts to
serve as external and/or (virtual) panel reviewers of proposals to
ROSES. Start at the landing page at:

https://science.nasa.gov/researchers/volunteer-review-panels 

If your skills match our needs for that review and there are not too
many organizational conflicts of interest, we will contact you.

The following new volunteer reviewer forms have been (re)posted
recently:

Astrophysics Research and Analysis (ROSES program element D.3)
Carbon Monitoring System (ROSES A.6) and
Carbon Cycle Science - Terrestrial (ROSES A.5)
Future Investigators in NASA Earth Science and Technology (FINESST
Earth)
Future Investigators in Space Science and Technology (FINESST Space)
Habitable Worlds (ROSES E.4)
Heliophysics Living With a Star Science (ROSES B.6)
Lunar Data Analysis (ROSES C.8)
Solar System Workings (ROSES C.3)

In addition to these previously posted volunteer forms that are still
available:

Astrophysics Data Analysis Program (Appendix D.2 of the annual ROSES
NRA)
Discovery Data Analysis (ROSES C.11)
Heliophysics Supporting Research (ROSES B.2)
Mars Data Analysis Program (ROSES C.9)
Physical Oceanography Program (PO)
Planetary Instrument Concepts for the Advancement of Solar System
Observations (PICASSO)

[NASA] PAYLOADS AND RESEARCH INVESTIGATIONS ON THE SURFACE OF THE MOON
(PRISM) STEP-2 DUE DATE DELAY

The Payloads and Research Investigations on the Surface of the Moon
(PRISM) program element solicits proposals for investigations that
include development and flight of science-driven suites of instruments
and technology demonstration payloads that will be delivered to the
lunar surface on Commercial Lunar Payload Services (CLPS). This PRISM
solicitation calls for science investigations that will be delivered to
the lunar surface in late Calendar Year (CY) 2023 and early CY2024 to
predetermined lunar landing sites: Reiner Gamma in Quarter 4 2023, and
a Schrodinger Basin impact melt in Q2 2024. Proposals must identify one
of these lunar landing sites and propose an investigation uniquely
achieved at that location.

This amendment delays the Step-2 due date for E.11 Payloads and
Research Investigations on the Surface of the Moon (PRISM). The Step-2
proposal due date for PRISM is now February 3, 2021.

This Amendment will be posted at: 

http://solicitation.nasaprs.com/ROSES2020 

and will appear on SARA's ROSES blog at:

https://science.nasa.gov/researchers/sara/grant-solicitations/roses-2020/

HIRISE DIGITAL TERRAIN MODELS BY REQUEST AND AT NO-COST FOR FUNDED MARS
DATA ANALYSIS PROGRAM AWARDS 

To support the needs of the Mars science community, the USGS
Astrogeology Science Center is providing HiRISE DTMs by request and at
no charge for funded ROSES 2020 Mars Data Analysis Program proposals.
Investigators are responsible for identification and selection of
appropriate HiRISE stereopairs, and must coordinate with USGS personnel
before proposal submission to obtain a Confirmation of Technical
Specification Letter. DTMs will only be generated for funded proposals.
Technical requirements can be found at the USGS Astrogeology Planetary
Photogrammetry site:

EXOPLANET SOLAR SYSTEM SYNERGIES TUTORIAL TALKS

The ExoPAG Science Interest Group 3 on Exoplanet Solar System Synergies
is organizing Tutorial Talks aimed at introducing field newcomers to
important topics planetary and exoplanetary science. The talks include
a 30-minute tutorial from an expert to introduce the topic, followed by
a 30-minute group discussion of a recent paper in which the
topic/method features. They are held by Zoom the 2nd Thursday of each
month 11 AM PST/ 2 PM EST. All talks are recorded and posted at: 

https://nexss.info/community/exoss-synergy

We have hosted four talks so far:

- "Solutions and Solubilities" by Laura Schaeffer
- "How to leverage NASA's Planetary Data System Atmospheres Node for
  exoplanet science" by Nancy Chanover
- "The advantages and challenges of M dwarfs as planet hosts" by
  Elisabeth Newton
- "Spectra of Solar System Planets for Exoplanet Scientists" by Mark
  Marley (NASA Ames) and Victoria Meadows

All are welcome, so feel free to share this announcement and the link
to the recording of the first tutorial. Also feel free to suggest
topics you'd like to hear on future tutorials to: Vikki Meadows 
(meadows@uw.edu), Mark Marley (mark.s.marley@nasa.gov), and Laura 
Schaefer (lkschaef@stanford.edu).

BRIDGE TO FACULTY PROGRAM AT THE UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT CHICAGO

The B2F program is a University-level initiative to increase the
pipeline toward faculty diversity at UIC by attracting and retaining
promising scholars from different backgrounds, with an emphasis on
individuals from groups who are underrepresented in their discipline.
Outstanding candidates will be mentored and supported to further their
research and scholarship during their postdoctoral appointments with
the goal that they will transition to a research-active, tenure-track
faculty position in the Department of Earth and Environmental Sciences.
The position is open to all disciplines in the Geosciences.
