IN MEMORIAM: KOICHIO TSURUDA (1937-2020)

Professor Koichiro Tsuruda passed away on the morning of December 3, 
2020, at the age of 83. After conducting VLF observations and research, 
Dr. Tsuruda created a new method of electric field measurement and 
installed it on the S-520-9 sounding rocket, the Akebono satellite, and 
the Geotail satellite, which was a major break-through in Solar System 
plasma science research. He also served as the Director of the 
Institute of Space and Astronautical Science (ISAS) from 2003 to 2005 
and guided the Institute through the difficult period just after it was 
integrated into the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency. Dr. Tsuruda had 
both a gentle personality and a strong resilience in his spirit, and 
many people loved him. He suffered from Parkinson's disease in his 
later years, but he passed away peacefully at home with his family 
watching over him.

[NASA] A REMEMBERANCE OF KOICHIO TSURUDA BY NASA CHIEF SCIENTIST 
JAMES GREEN

As a young NASA researcher who was the deputy Project Scientist on the 
Global Geospace Science set of satellites I had the pleasure of 
traveling to ISAS and working with the Geotail scientists where I met 
Dr. Tsuruda. I was already very familiar with his seminal Akebono wave 
papers. He was an outstanding scientist who took time to explain a 
number of key plasma wave concepts to me that I will never forget. We 
again met when he headed ISAS guiding that nations robotic space 
program with extensive knowledge and skill and forming long lasting 
relationships with NASA. He is one of our original space pioneers and 
will be missed.

EDITOR NOTE: NEW PROCEDURE FOR OBTAINING EMAIL ADDRESSES AND OTHER 
CONTACT INFORMATION FOR NASA PERSONNEL

NASA has permanently disabled its very useful public directory after
more than a decade: 

https://people.nasa.gov

There is no replacement. If you need contact information for a NASA 
employee, the following procedure is recommended:

(1) Call NASA Headquarters (202-358-0000).
(2) Request the contact information desired (e.g., phone number,
    email). This might require obtaining contact information for a 
    NASA Center.
(3) Write it down on a paper tablet using a #2 pencil.
(4) Repeat as needed.

Please note that the people answering the number above are very helpful 
and friendly. Be nice.

VEGU2021 SESSION PS3.4: MARS SCIENCE AND EXPLORATION

Due to the pandemic, EGU will be hosting vEGU21: Gather Online 
(#vEGU21), a fully virtual meeting and it will take place April 19-30, 
2021.

Please consider submitting an abstract to the EGU2021 Session PS3.4: 
Mars Science and Exploration. Go to:

https://meetingorganizer.copernicus.org/EGU21/session/39970

Abstract submissions will be accepted until January 13, 2021 at 13:00 
CET.

The Mars Science and Exploration Session will address the latest 
results from past/current missions as well as results obtained from 
ground-based measurements, terrestrial analog studies, laboratory 
experiments and modelling as well as future exploration and prospects.
In this session, we welcome contributions on scientific investigations 
as well as theoretical models concerning the deep interior and 
subsurface structure and composition; the surface morphology and 
composition; the atmospheric composition, dynamics and climate; 
the ionospheric environment and its interaction with the solar wind; 
astrobiology and habitability of Mars. We invite also contributions 
on martian meteorites. All petrological, geochemical and isotopic 
studies unraveling composition and structure of martian crust, igneous 
processes and fluid/rock interaction record are welcome.

With best regards,

The conveners,

Arianna Piccialli, Benjamin Bultel, Jessica Flahaut, Agata Krzesinska,

MSR SAMPLE CACHING STRATEGY WORKSHOP

Full text of this announcement can be viewed at: 

https://mepag.jpl.nasa.gov/announcements/CachingStratWorkshopAnnouncement.pdf

We are inviting you to an open virtual science community workshop to 
consider the strategy for caching samples on Mars as a key element in 
planning their return to Earth by means of the NASA and ESA Mars Sample 
Return missions.

We solicit your participation in a four-hour workshop on January 21, 
2021 (8am-12pm PST) to consider the strategy for establishing the caches 
on Mars. Key discussion points will include:

    What are the minimum attributes of a cache that warrants sample 
    return? 
    What should be the strategy for duplicate sampling? 
    What approach(es) will offer the best balance between minimizing 
    risk and maximizing the scientific value of the samples to be 
    returned?

The workshop will present a review of relevant material, and a forum 
for community discussion on possible viable scenarios for a sample 
caching strategy.

More detailed information will be forthcoming. Please let us know of 
your interest so we can properly scope the meeting by filling out the 
Indication of Interest form at:

PLANETARY DATA ECOSYSTEM INDEPENDENT REVIEW BOARD

The NASA Planetary Science Division (PSD) has established an 
Independent Review Board (IRB) for the Planetary Data Ecosystem (PDE), 
defined as the ad hoc connected framework of activities and products 
that are built upon and support the data collected by planetary space 
missions and research programs which are primarily NASA funded. Many 
familiar tools and archives are part of the PDE, including (but not 
limited to): ADS, DAPs, JMars, JPL Horizons, MAPSIT, and PDS.

The IRB will conduct a review of the PDE with the goal of defining the 
full environment, identifying missing or overly redundant elements, 
and providing findings and prioritized, actionable recommendations for 
PSD's long-term planning in support of the PDE.

The PDE IRB will hold an open meeting on December 17, 2020 from 
11am-2pm EST. The community is invited to attend as observers (but not 
as participants). The meeting may be joined by using this link or 
dial-in number:

https://meet.google.com/fir-ribb-xmm

(US) +1 641-569-8600 (PIN: 777029345)

Additional dates and times for future meetings will be announced as 
they become available.

Questions or comments may be directed to PDEIRB.Input@nress.org
