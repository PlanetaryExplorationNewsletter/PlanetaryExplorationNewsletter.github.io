COMMUNITY FEEDBACK ON DRAFT MEPAG GOALS DOCUMENT WELCOMED VIA TELECON

The MEPAG Goals Committee is committed to enabling community feedback
on the draft 2020 MEPAG Goals Document:

https://mepag.jpl.nasa.gov/reports.cfm?expand=science

Both positive and negative feedback can now be submitted via two 
venues.

Written feedback (through February 14):

https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfNrO3P-
1jli7pXSOx3KCJbJwP1tgjJcPzY88R4v5rbgT28xw/viewform

Verbal feedback:

Telecon on Monday, February 10, from 8:30 AM-10AM Pacific
(11:30AM-1:00PM Eastern). This telecon is not intended to be a session
for the MEPAG Goals Committee to explain their choices in the draft to
date (as it may change!), but instead to allow the community further
opportunity to voice their ideas and thoughts. WebEx connection
information is below and will be added to the MEPAG website. And please
note that this telecon will be recorded, but only for the use of the
MEPAG Goals Committee in capturing your input for consideration for
revising the draft Goals Document.

We look forward to hearing from you,
Don Banfield (MEPAG Goals Chair) and the MEPAG Goals Committee

PH.D. POSITION ON MODELING AND OBSERVATION OF ROCK-RICH PLANETARY 
SURFACES

The Institute of Planetology at the University of Muenster, Germany, is
seeking a researcher to carry out a 3 year Ph.D. in planetary science,
starting April 15, 2020 at the earliest, and funded at 75% (E13 TV-L)
level.

The Ph.D. candidate will be part of a junior research group dedicated
to the understanding of regolith evolution and to the analysis of
images returned by spacecraft from the Moon, asteroids, and Mars.
Understanding the nature, origin and evolution of regolith is paramount
for a wide range of research fields and will serve engineering purposes
for rovers and landers mission. The activities of the Ph.D. student
will be (1) the development of a numerical model to describe the
process of small impact (<1m) bombardment and the evolution of
boulder-rich surfaces and (2) use of the model developed to analyze
remote sensing images of planetary surfaces. The requirements are (1)
proven and in-depth expertise in programming (e.g. Matlab), (2)
experience with remote sensing data or software, (3) master's degree in
geophysics, geo-informatics, or equivalent.

Interested candidates are welcome to contact Dr. Ottaviano Ruesch at
the address below for further information on the application.

OSE objectives and provide academic institutions the ability to enhance
graduate-level learning and development. The program details and
requirements are outlined in the solicitation document.

To be eligible to submit a proposal, candidates must be U.S. citizens
or a national who hold a bachelor's degree in a STEM field earned
before Aug. 31, 2020. Candidates must be enrolled in a Master's or
Doctoral degree program no later than Sept. 1, 2020, and intend to
pursue a research-based Master's or Ph.D. program in a NASA-relevant

[NASA] ANNOUNCEMENT FOR PLANETARY SCIENCE ADVISORY COMMITTEE 
NOMINATIONS

The Planetary Science Advisory Committee (PAC) supports the advisory
needs of the Planetary Science Division (PSD), the Science Mission
Directorate (SMD) and other mission directorates as required, and the
NASA Administrator. The advisory scope of the PAC includes all aspects
of NASA's planetary science program, including scientific research;
considerations of the development of near-term enabling technologies,
systems, and computing and information management capabilities; and
developments with the potential to provide long-term improvements in
future mission operational systems.

Responsibility for biological planetary protection is outside the
purview of the PAC. NASA's PSD is extending the invitation for
nominations for service on the PAC. Interested members of the community
are invited to review the charter and to submit nominations (including
self-nominations) for consideration to fill vacancies on the Committee.

For details, go to:

THIRD ANNOUNCEMENT - TOWARDS OTHER EARTH III: FROM SOLAR SYSTEM TO
EXOPLANETS

CONFERENCE- Towards Other Earth III: from Solar System to Exoplanets

1-5 June 2020
Lamego, Douro Valley, Portugal
Theater Ribeiro Conceicao, Lamego, Portugal

Atmosphere, Interior, formation and evolution of planets and
planetary systems. The Solar System Planets and Exoplanets communities
aim at answering similar questions, but seldom interact due to the
different datasets they have access to.

We aim to discuss how the detailed and in situ datasets from Solar
System planets can inform the often under constrained exoplanetary
models. We will try to uncover how the diversity and large sample
offered by exoplanets can put in context and inform our understanding
of Solar System planets, focusing on each of these categories:

Super-Earths, Mercury, Venus, Mars and Earth
Ice giants, Uranus and Neptune
Gas giants, Jupiter and Saturn
Planetary System architecture
