LPSC 51 CANCELLED

We regret to inform you that LPSC 51 is cancelled due to concerns
about COVID-19. Please note the following additional information:

- We will reimburse all registration fees, minus a 10% processing fee
  to cover our costs. We only have a small staff to manage refunds to
  over 1,600 registrants, so we ask for your patience.
- We plan to broadcast some of the key NASA and NRC peripheral
  meetings over the next few weeks; please stay tuned to the LPI & LPSC
  websites and social media (Twitter: @LPItoday and Facebook: 
  @LunarandPlanetaryInstitute) for more information about scheduling.
- We do not see any feasible way at this time to broadcast individual
  talks or posters; LPSC is simply too large, and we do not have the
  staff to support these types of activities.
- If you have any further questions, please e-mail us at
  MeetingInfo@hou.usra.edu. We will respond as soon as we are able, but
  please be patient.

MEPAG VIRTUAL MEETING #8 PRESENTATIONS ARE NOW ONLINE

MEPAGers,

The presentations from the February 28th MEPAG Virtual Meeting #8 (VM8)
are now online:

https://mepag.jpl.nasa.gov/meetings.cfm?expand=m38

We apologize to those who had difficulties connecting when calling in
to the meeting. When the 1st Information Circular was created for VM8,
the correct URL for the WebEx meeting connection was included but an
old (VM7) meeting number was retained. This disconnect was propagated
through all VM8 advertisements and was not discovered until the meeting
(VM8) had started; as it occurred on a JPL RDO we were unable to send
out a correction at that time. We hope that no one was completely
prevented from attending VM8, but in light of the issue, we have
striven to expeditiously post the presentations from VM8.

DECISION ABOUT APRIL MEPAG MEETING PLANS TO BE MADE BY MARCH 13

In light of the cancellation of the 2020 LPSC meeting and general
concerns about exposure to the coronavirus, MEPAG continues to monitor
the situation for the April 15-17 MEPAG face-to-face meeting in
Arlington, VA. We will make a decision on or before March 13 on whether
to keep the in-person meeting (with remote attendance options) or to
convert to a fully virtual meeting. We suggest waiting to make or
change travel arrangements until this announcement. Depending on how
the situation and institutional travel policies develop during the next
week, a decision may be made sooner.

If you wish to discuss a white paper topic (whether in-person or
remotely), it is important that you provide the information requested
in the 2nd information circular by March 19.

Additionally, please note that the Early Career travel grant deadline
remains March 6, although this opportunity will obviously be cancelled
if there is no travel.

Suggestions for methods of improving virtual attendance at the MEPAG
meeting (whether it is in-person or moved to fully virtual) are welcome
and can be sent to mepagmeetingqs@jpl.nasa.gov.

SBAG EARLY CAREER OPPORTUNITIES

The next SBAG meeting will be June 1-2 in Laurel, MD. We have two 
opportunities at specifically aimed at the early-career small body
community:

Early-career travel support: With funding from NASA, we are planning to
offer limited U.S. travel support for early career scientists to
participate in the SBAG 23 meeting. Interested undergraduate students,
graduate students, postdocs, and other early career scientists (within
5 years of PhD/MS/BS) should submit a letter and a CV to SBAG
early-career secretary Terik Daly (terik.daly@jhuapl.edu) by COB (5 pm
Eastern time) April 3, 2020. Further application information can be
found on the SBAG website:

https://www.lpi.usra.edu/sbag/

Lightning Talks: We are providing time on the agenda for early-career
scientists and engineers present at the meeting to introduce themselves
and their research to the community. The talks will be 3 minutes each.
If you are interested in giving a lightning talk, please contact the
Terik Daly (terik.daly@jhuapl.edu) two weeks before the meeting.

LABORATORY ASTROPHYSICS DIVISION MEETING ABSTRACT DEADLINE

We are working on enhancing the exchange and collaboration between DPS
and LAD and we invite you to submit abstracts to the LAD meeting in
Madison, WI. Deadline is March 10, 2020. Abstracts related to any area
of planetary science (observational, modeling, laboratory) and
astrophysics that need, utilize, or provide laboratory data are
welcome.

Laboratory Astrophysics Division (LAD) is one of the divisions of the
AAS, just like DPS. LAD focuses on facilitating collaboration among
laboratory astrophysicists and planetary scientists and their
observational/modeling counterparts. Our goal is to bring LAD and DPS
communities together.

This year's LAD meeting has several invited talks that cover both
astrophysics and planetary science research areas. Plenty of room has
been left in the schedule for several contributed talks and posters!
Please plan to attend and present your latest results at what will be
one of top meetings for Laboratory Astrophysics in 2020!

We invite you to submit abstracts (deadline March 10, 2020).

NOMINATE YOUR COLLEAGUES FOR DPS PRIZES

The community relies on YOU to submit nominations - please don't expect
that others will take care of this important task. While nominators
must be DPS members, we encourage members from all career stages and
areas of expertise to nominate colleagues. We would like to have a
large, diverse pool of nominees for each prize!

The updated DPS Prize descriptions include the prize requirements that
will be used by the DPS prize subcommittee and DPS committee to award
the prizes. When preparing nomination letters, you are strongly
encouraged to provide examples and evidence to support your statements
for the nominee.

The eligibility windows may have shifted for some individuals. Please
email the DPS Prize subcommittee at dpsprize@aas.org if there are any
mitigating circumstances concerning eligibility for a given prize, and
they will be taken into consideration as part of the transition to the
new prize requirements this year. Also, any active prize nomination
package can be updated if needed in light of the new requirements.

Detailed information can be found at:
