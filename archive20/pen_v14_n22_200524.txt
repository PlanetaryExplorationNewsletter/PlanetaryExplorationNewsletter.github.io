NEXSS NPMP OPPORTUNITY

The NExSS (Nexus for Exoplanet Systems Science) has a new opportunity
for a NASA Postdoctoral Management fellowship. NExSS is an
interdisciplinary research network including experts in Earth Science,
Planetary Science, Heliophysics, and Astrophysics:

http://nexss.info

The main goal of NExSS is to apply a "systems science" perspective to
the study of exoplanets, so we can study their diversity, histories,
and habitability. Teams extrapolate our knowledge of Earth as a planet
and the examples provided by the Sun and planets in our Solar System to
better understand exoplanets, and vice versa. As a coordinated network,
NExSS fosters interdisciplinary, collaborative work and facilitates
access to diverse skill sets and a broad knowledge base.

This position will be split equally between research and
policy/management work. The research will be composed of an independent
research project led by the postdoctoral fellow, that leverages the
NExSS science community. The management work involves interfacing with
the NExSS science community in the pursuit of strengthening and
expanding that community. Efforts in this area could include:
facilitating collaborations; coordinating webinars, workshops, and
other virtual meetings; leading or organizing the writing of white
papers; improving communication both within and beyond the network, and
contributing to the strategies for pursuing the above goals.

Deadline: July 1, 2020.

[NASA] ROSES: CHANGES TO C.18 EARLY CAREER FELLOWSHIP START-UP PROGRAM

ROSES-2020 Amendment 22 changes ROSES program element C.18, Early
Career Fellowship Start-Up Program for Named Fellows in a number of
ways. First, previously named Early Career Fellows who intend to submit
to this program element, must email the new point of contact,
melissa.a.morris@nasa.gov, by September 1, 2020 to discuss their
eligibility. It is anticipated that this is the last year that this
program element will be solicited. Proposals are due on the date given
in Section 4 and in Tables 2 and 3 of this ROSES NRA.

Coordinator and the NASA HQ Program Officer overseeing the mapping
program.

The abstract submission form is now available online. Abstracts are
limited to one page, 250 words, and one figure, and are due June 18,
2020 by 5:00 pm Central Daylight Time.

Registration is free and available online. The deadline to register is

[NASA] ROSES-2020 CLARIFICATION REGARDING ACRONYMS
 
The ROSES-2020 Summary of Solicitation has been clarified to set this
default rule for all ROSES-2020 proposals regarding the use of
acronyms: If an acronym used in the page limited
Scientific/Technical/Management (S/T/M) section needs to be defined, it
must be defined within the S/T/M section at least the first time it is
used. That is, proposers may not define acronyms solely in a list
outside of the page-limited S/T/M section. If and only if acronyms are
defined within the S/T/M section, may an acronym list also be provided
outside of the S/T/M section.

Questions regarding this clarification to ROSES-2020 may be directed to
SARA@nasa.gov.
