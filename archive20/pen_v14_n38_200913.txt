[NASA] ROSES-20: RELEASE OF FINAL TEXT OF CITIZEN SCIENCE SEED FUNDING 
PROGRAM

The Citizen Science Seed Funding Program (CSSFP) element of ROSES aims
to support scientists and other experts to develop citizen science
projects relevant to NASA's Astrophysics, Heliophysics and Planetary
Science Research Programs. Proposals relevant to Biological and
Physical Sciences will also be considered on a case by case basis. The
CSSFP aims to advance the use of citizen science by incubating citizen
science projects as they are being conceived or during critical
transitions. CSSFP awards require relatively short proposals to 
encourage new proposers to experiment with citizen science techniques; 
the Science/Technical/Management section has a limit of 6 pages.

Notices of Intent to propose are due October 13, 2020 and 6-page 
proposals are due December 11, 2020. A FAQ document will be posted on 
the NSPIRES page for this program element under "Other Documents".

This Amendment to ROSES 2020 (NNH20ZDA001N) will be posted at:

http://solicitation.nasaprs.com/ROSES2020

and will appear on SARA's ROSES blog at: 

https://science.nasa.gov/researchers/sara/grant-solicitations/roses-2020/

Questions concerning Citizen Science Seed Funding Program may be
directed to Marc Kuchner at marc.kuchner@nasa.gov

[NASA] PLANETARY WEBINAR: DUAL-ANONYMOUS PEER REVIEW FOR HABITABLE
WORLDS UNDER ROSES-2020

Wednesday, October 7th, 3-4 PM ET

NASA's Science Mission Directorate will host a webinar to discuss the
implementation of dual-anonymous peer review for the Habitable Worlds
Program (E.4 of ROSES-2020). In dual-anonymous peer review, not only
are proposers unaware of the identity of reviewers, but the reviewers
do not have explicit knowledge of the proposing teams and institutions
during the scientific evaluation of the proposal. The webinar will: (1)
discuss the motivation for switching to dual-anonymous peer review, (2)
describe important changes to proposal writing to be compliant with
dual-anonymous peer review, and (3) explain how dual-anonymous peer
reviews work in Habitable Worlds.

In advance of the webinar, questions may be submitted and upvoted at:

https://arc.cnf.io/sessions/zazz/#!/dashboard

The webinar will be broadcast live via WebEx:

https://www.mymeetings.com/nc/join.php?i=PWXW1658125&p=5255996&t=c

Audio is available by calling 1-415-228-3920 or toll-free at
1-888-469-3088; use access code 525 5996.

There is a tremendous demonstrated value in Extended Missions. They
produce excellent science at low incremental cost. Additionally, these
missions provide early-career scientists opportunities for active
mission involvement and experience in leadership roles, thus increasing
diversity at all levels. However, despite NASA's best intentions, there
are aspects of their handling of Extended Missions that have
detrimental effects to the success of those missions. We recommend
several specific actions to be taken to ensure the financial stability
of EMs, for the benefit to science, and to our community of scientists.

This will be an update to the 2016 National Academies report on
"Extending Science: NASA's Space Science Mission Extensions and the
Senior Review Process". We plan to evaluate the recommendations of that
study, provide a reminder of those recommendations which have not yet
been addressed, and add new recommendations.

Contact Ingrid Daubar (ingrid_daubar@brown.edu) and/or Ross Beyer
(rbeyer@seti.org) with any questions or comments.

addresses, working sessions, and technical poster presentations (a
preliminary agenda is posted at:

http://lsic.jhuapl.edu/Events/102.php?id=102 

It will be updated as additional detail are finalized. The event will
center on the interrelationships between the six LSIC focus areas,
especially in the context of surface power. We invite abstracts
describing technical capabilities within the six LSIC focus areas, as
well as those that identify lunar surface technology needs and assess
the readiness of relative systems and components. The six LSIC
technical focus areas are:

Dust Mitigation
Excavation & Construction
Extreme Access
Extreme Environments
In Situ Resource Utilization
Surface Power

Other topics of interest include defining the parameters and
constraints of the architecture required to support a sustained
presence on the lunar surface, as well as economic and policy
considerations. Early registration closes at 11:59PM EDT on September
19th, 2020 and will help the registration committee determine which
discussion groups participants get placed into.
