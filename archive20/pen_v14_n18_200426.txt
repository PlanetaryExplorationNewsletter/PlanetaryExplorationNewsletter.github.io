WORLD VIEW NASA EARTH VENTURE MISSION 3 ANNOUNCEMENT

Stratollites are high-altitude solar-powered platforms that can support 
several of the focus areas of NASA's Earth Venture Mission (EVM) 3 
program via payload TRL raising for risk reduction and/or by providing 
measurements with adjunct calibration or science measurements to 
augment EVM-3 satellites. Stratollites use lift, ballast, and winds 
at different altitudes to control trajectory and to loiter in areas of 
interest. Stratollites can carry up to 100 kg and 300 W of payload. In
addition to TRL-raising, Stratollite applications for EMV-3 support 
could include in situ and remote sensing measurements of atmospheric 
composition, weather, carbon cycle, water and energy cycle, and climate 
variability and change. For more information, contact Alan Stern
(astern@worldview.space) or see:

EXOPLANETS: THE NEXUS OF ASTRONOMY AND GEOSCIENCE

This is a call for papers to a special section of JGR-Planets entitled, 
"Exoplanets: The Nexus of Astronomy and Geoscience."

AGU Guest Editors: Cayman Unterborn (Arizona State University), Laura 
Schaefer (Stanford University), Eliza Kempton (University of Maryland), 
Seth Jacobson (Michigan State University)

In recent years, our knowledge about exoplanets has expanded 
tremendously. From super-Earths to water worlds, Hot Jupiters to 
mini-Neptunes, exoplanets represent a diversity of worlds well beyond 
that of our Solar System. The field of exoplanets is moving from an 
era of discovering exoplanets to understanding their populations and 
characterizing individual exoplanets in detail. To do this, however, 
requires a monumental interdisciplinary effort, bringing together 
astronomers, geoscientists, and planetary scientists including 
observers, theorists, and experimentalists. In this special section of 
JGR Planets, we wish to bring together authors from across each of 
these disciplines to present results of interest to the wider exoplanet 
field and cross these traditional disciplinary boundaries.

As part of the special section, all papers will be published with Gold 
open-access at no extra charge.

Submissions are being accepted on a rolling basis until September 30,
2020.

Manuscripts are to be submitted through the AGU website:

THE 2020 PLANETARY SCIENCE WORKFORCE SURVEY

The AIP is conducting a Survey of the Planetary Science Community. The 
survey is being sponsored by the AAS Division for Planetary Science 
(DPS) and is also serving as the DPS membership survey and the followup 
to the 2011 Planetary Workforce Survey: 

http://lasp.colorado.edu/home/mop/resources/planetary-science-workforce-survey

The 2020 survey is being sent to everyone who is either a member of 
DPS, GSA (planetary division), and/or on the LPSC email list serve. The 
message requesting your response is from DPS Chair Amanda Hendrix 
(using email address stats@aip-info.org).

Our hope is that the results of this survey will be useful to the 
community, particularly as input into the Planetary Decadal Survey 
since it now includes "Workforce issues". Please fill this survey out 
to have your voice heard.

If you believe you should have received this email, but haven't, please 
check your junk and spam folders as several people have reported 
finding the survey there.

Questions/comments can be directed to stats@aip-info.org or 
Amanda Hendrix (arh@psi.edu).
