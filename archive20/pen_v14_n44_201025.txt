NEW DISCOVERY ABOUT THE MOON ANNOUNCEMENT

NASA will announce an exciting new discovery about the Moon from the
Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy (SOFIA) at a media
teleconference at 12 p.m. EDT Monday, Oct. 26.

This new discovery contributes to NASA's efforts to learn about the
Moon in support of deep space exploration.

SOFIA is a modified 747 that flies high in the atmosphere to provide
its nearly 9-foot telescope a view above 99% of the atmosphere's
obscuring water vapor. SOFIA observes in infrared wavelengths and can
pick up phenomenon impossible to see with visible light.

[NASA] RELEASE OF FINAL TEXT OF E.7 OPEN SOURCE TOOLS, LIBRARIES, AND 
FRAMEWORKS

SMD seeks proposals for the improvement and sustainment of high-value,
open source tools, frameworks, and libraries that have made significant
impacts to the SMD science community, were developed following
open and collaborative practices, and are aligned with the scientific
and data strategic plans.

Proposals should look to improve the sustainability and utility of
these packages through improvements to documentation or infrastructure,
by adding extensions, and improving maintenance of the existing
software.
 
This program seeks to support projects under active development and
usage. It does not support updating of legacy software that is no
longer supported, which can be supported under other calls. We are not
soliciting the development of new open source tools, frameworks, or
libraries with this call.

[NASA] HABITABLE WORLDS CHANGE IN SCOPE

The goal of the Habitable Worlds program is to use knowledge of the
history of the Earth and the life upon it as a guide for determining
the processes and conditions that create and maintain habitable
environments and to search for ancient and contemporary habitable
environments and explore the possibility of extant life beyond the
Earth.

The scope of this program element has been updated to include transient
environments. Please refer to the bullet list of target bodies in
Section 1. The main point of contact has also changed, see below. The
proposal due dates remain unchanged: Step-1 proposals are due
11/17/2020 and Step-2 proposals are due 01/15/2021.

This Amendment will be posted on the NASA research opportunity homepage
at: 

http://solicitation.nasaprs.com/ROSES2020 

and will appear on SARA's ROSES blog at: 

https://science.nasa.gov/researchers/sara/grant-solicitations/roses-2020/

Questions concerning Habitable Worlds may be directed to Lindsay Hays

[NASA] RELEASE OF FINAL TEXT AND DUE DATES FOR C.17 PLANETARY MAJOR 
EQUIPMENT AND FACILITIES: STAND-ALONE PROPOSALS

The Planetary Major Equipment and Facilities (PMEF) program element
allows proposals for the purchase or development of new or upgraded
non-flight analytical, computational, telescopic, and other
instrumentation to be used in investigations in Planetary Science
Division (PSD) research programs.

This Amendment pertains specifically to Stand-Alone PMEF requests,
which are self-contained, full proposals submitted to enable future
PSD-funded research or enhance PSD-funded research in one or more of
the Target Programs. Both Investigator Instruments and Facility
Instruments may be requested in Stand-Alone PMEF proposals.

Amendment 62 releases final text and due dates for C.17 Planetary Major
Equipment and Facilities: Stand-alone proposals. The changes are not
tracked, the text is replaced in its entirety. The expected annual
program budget for new awards has been increased to ~$1.5M. C.24 YORPD
is not eligible for stand-alone PMEF proposals.

Step-1 proposals are due by December 4, 2020. Step-2 proposals are due
February 5, 2021.

[NASA] COMING SOON: PI LAUNCHPAD 2021 

NASA's Science Mission Directorate, in partnership with the
Heising-Simons Foundation, will host a virtual workshop planned for
early Summer 2021 to explore the fundamentals of how to turn a science
question into a mission concept.

The workshop is targeted towards researchers who have previously
submitted proposals to any organization and are thinking about
developing their first flight mission proposal within the next few
years. Participants will go step-by-step through the process to develop
a science case, define requirements, build a team, and gain support.
There is no cost to attend the workshop.

A call will be posted on NSPIRES in early 2021 with an opportunity to
apply to Launchpad 2021. 

https://science.nasa.gov/researchers/pi-launchpad

The format of the application will consist of no more than 5 questions, 
focused on: 

- What science question would you like to develop into a mission 
  concept?
- Views on Leadership.
- Role of Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Accessibility (DEIA) in 
  teams.
- Group and power dynamics in teams.
- Management for effective teams.
 
If you have questions, please contact Prof. Erika Hamden
(hamden@arizona.edu)

LATE-BREAKING AGU SESSION ON VENUS

Session title: "Phosphine in the Venusian Atmosphere: Observations and 
Implications"

The recent observations suggesting the possible presence of phosphine
on Venus, previously considered as a potential biosignature for
exoplanetary atmospheres, presents a challenge for existing models of
atmospheric chemistry and possibly supports the case for an aerial
ecosystem in an otherwise hyperacidic, oxidizing atmosphere. In this
session, we invite presentations regarding current and past
observations and interpretations of phosphine in the Venusian
atmosphere; surface-atmosphere interactions and chemistry relevant to
the phosphine cycle; design considerations for upcoming spacecraft and
instruments; and other work inspired by these recent events.

Abstract submission deadline: November 11, 2020 (11:59 ET)
