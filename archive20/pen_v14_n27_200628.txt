TITAN DECADAL SURVEY WHITEPAPERS OPEN FOR ENDORSERS

The Titan community has written three whitepapers for the upcoming 
Decacal Survey for which we would like to solicit endorsers among the 
scientific community. The three whitepapers discuss (1) the outstanding 
science questions to be explored at Titan after Cassini, (2) how those 
questions might be addressed with a New-Frontiers-class Titan orbiter, 
and (3) how those questions might be addressed with a Flagship-class 
Titan orbiter carrying a sea probe. Drafts for the whitepapers, along 
with space to add the names of endorsers, can be found at the links 
below. We would welcome your input and support,

Jason W. Barnes, Conor A. Nixon, Shannon M. MacKenzie

WHITE PAPER ON URANIAN MOONS/MAG/RINGS NEW FRONTIERS MISSION CONCEPT

A draft of a White Paper for the NASA Planetary Science and 
Astrobiology Decadal Survey 2023-2032 titled "A New Frontiers Class 
Mission for the Uranian System that Focuses on Moon, Magnetosphere, and 
Ring Science" is now available at:

https://drive.google.com/file/d/1YL_-_y5lSgkeUJusVo5KH0-GpXiZrp7k/view?usp=sharing

The white paper will be submitted to the National Academies on July 
15th. Until then, we welcome additional endorsements. Please reach out 
to Erin Leonard (Erin.J.Leonard@jpl.nasa.gov) with your name and 
affiliation if you would like to endorse this white paper.

DPS EDUCATION AND OUTREACH GRANTS

The DPS Committee is offering small grants (average amounts of $200 to 
$500) to support DPS members to engage in local and virtual education 
and public engagement activities. These grants are intended to support 
DPS member efforts to engage other members, students, teachers, and the 
public and can be used for materials, consumables, equipment but not 
for salary or travel to DPS meetings. Proposals are being accepted for 
programs that will occur by June 1, 2021. We encourage creative 
solutions for engagement efforts that also conform to social-distancing 
requirements. Questions about acceptable costs should be addressed to 
buxner@psi.edu. Proposals should be emailed to buxner@psi.edu and you 
will receive an email confirmation.

Applications will be accepted in two review cycles - the first deadline 
is July 1 (11:59pm in proposers' local time), and awardees will be 
contacted by July 15. The second deadline will be August 1, and 
awardees will be contacted by August 15. All proposals will be 
reviewed by members of the DPS education committee and the executive 
committee.

Complete directions, including a scoring rubric, can be found at: 

https://dps.aas.org/education/education-outreach-grants/application

Please address any questions to buxner@psi.edu.

POSTDOCTORAL RESEARCHER IN PLANETARY MAGNETOSPHERIC PHYSICS

Applications are now being accepted for two postdoctoral scientists to
work with the NASA/Goddard Space Flight Center Planetary Magnetospheres
Laboratory in Greenbelt, MD. The position is funded through the CRESST
II.

Position 1: The postdoctoral researcher will work for either the Juno
project with the primary responsibility of conducting analysis and
publishing magnetometer results. In addition, the candidate will
assist with magnetometer data validation and calibration. 

Position 2: The data scientist's primary responsibility will be to 
develop a data production pipeline for future magnetometer missions. 
This involves taking raw magnetometer data, applying the appropriate
transformations and calibrations, and producing the final public data
products. The data scientist is encouraged to pursue their own research
interest.

Candidates for these positions should have Ph.D. in physics, astronomy, 
planetary science, space physics, geosciences, or related fields. 
Successful candidates should also have expertise with one or more 
programming languages commonly used in space science and a demonstrated 
track record in analyzing spaceflight data, especially magnetometer 
data and experience with the NAIF SPICE software package is highly 
desired.

Applications received by July 15, 2020 will receive the best
consideration. Link to full job posting:

[NASA] PLANETARY SCIENCE REMINDER REGARDING LETTER OF RESOURCE SUPPORT
FOR FACILITIES

Program elements in Planetary Science have been clarified regarding 
letters of resource support for facilities: Proposers are reminded 
that, per the directions in Section 3.17 of the NASA Guidebook for 
Proposers and Table 1 of the ROSES Summary of Solicitation, any 
facility or resource not under the direct control of the PI or a Co-I 
requires a letter of resource support acknowledging that it is 
available for the proposed use during the proposed period. 

Due dates remain unchanged.

[NASA] 2020 GUIDEBOOK FOR PROPOSERS APPLIES TO ROSES AFTER 
SEPTEMBER 25, 2020

The 2020 Guidebook for Proposers Responding to a NASA Notice of Funding 
Opportunity has been posted with an effective date of June 23, 2020,
at:

https://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/procurement/nraguidebook/ 

It is not anticipated that this version of the Guidebook will change 
the content of proposals to ROSES but, just to give everyone time to 
review it, the ROSES-2020 Summary of Solicitation has been updated to 
indicate that the 2020 Guidebook will only apply to ROSES proposals 
with due dates after September 25, 2020.

Questions regarding this clarification may be directed to 
sara@nasa.gov.

[NASA] ROSES: DART PARTICIPATING SCIENTIST PROGRAM FINAL TEXT RELEASED

The objective of the Double Asteroid Redirection Test (DART) 
Participating Scientist Program (PSP) is to enhance the scientific 
return of the DART mission through new investigations, conducted during 
the primary flight and post-flight phases (mission Phases E and F), 
that broaden and/or complement DART's primary investigation.

The DART-PSP solicits proposals for science investigations to be 
carried out during the primary flight and post-flight phases that 
significantly enhance the scientific return of the DART mission and 
that address outstanding questions related to Planetary Defense. 
Proposed investigations shall have science objectives directed toward 
understanding the Didymos system in particular, and (optionally) 
near-Earth asteroids in general. Proposed activities may include any or 
all of:(a) analysis of raw and/or calibrated spacecraft data, 
(b) acquisition and/or analysis of ground-based data, (c) model 
development and/or fitting, (d) data interpretation, (e) correlative 
studies,(f) laboratory experiments, and (g) fundamental theory.

This program requires a Notice of Intent (NOI). Proposals that are not 
preceded by the mandatory NOI may be returned without review. Mandatory 
NOIs are due August 10, 2020, and proposals are due September 24, 2020.

[NASA] ROSES: CLARIFICATION OF E.4 HABITABLE WORLDS

Dual-Anonymous Peer Review (DAPR) ROSES Program elements (including 
E.4 Habitable Worlds) have been clarified to remove an ambiguity 
regarding the budget: both the (redacted) budget numbers and 
justification are expected as part of the anonymized proposal. The 
DAPR instructions have likewise been clarified. New text is in bold.

The due dates remain unchanged. In addition, Q&A #8 about tables of 
contents will be added to the FAQ at the bottom of the DAPR web page
