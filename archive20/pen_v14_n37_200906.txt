EXOPLANET-SOLAR SYSTEM SYNERGY TUTORIAL TALK
 
The next ExoPAG SIG3 Exoplanet-Solar System Synergy Tutorial Talk will
be given by Prof. Nancy Chanover, who will provide an introduction to
the Planetary Data System Atmospheres Node for those who might be
considering using the PDS for exoplanet science.

These tutorial talks are aimed at introducing field newcomers to
important topics or methods in planetary and exoplanetary science. 
They typically include a 30 minute tutorial from an expert to introduce
the topic, followed by a 30 minute group discussion of a recent paper
in which the topic/method features. 

Date/Time: Sep 10 at 11am PDT / 2pm EDT

Node
MCS data at the Atmospheres Node
SPICE data at the NAIF Node

The data may be accessed at

https://pds-geosciences.wustl.edu/missions/mro/

MRO data releases occur every three months. The next release is
scheduled for December 1, 2020.

WHITE PAPERS ON DEIA TOPICS FOR THE 2013-2022 PLANETARY SCIENCE DECADAL
SURVEY

Diversity, Equity, Inclusion and Accessibility (DEIA) efforts within
the Planetary Science community have become a focus point of several
NASA Assessment/Analysis Groups (AGs). The EDI Working Group (WG) was
formed by the AGs and its steering committee consists of members of
each AG steering committee and several affinity groups. The WG has
helped gather community input in the form of a series of Professional
White Papers (WPs) in preparation for the Planetary Science Decadal
Survey (Planetary2023). These WPs will be submitted by their individual
authors in support of the Planetary2023's Statement of Task Part 9:

"The state of the profession including issues of diversity, inclusion,
equity, and accessibility, the creation of safe workspaces, and
recommended policies and practices to improve the state of the
profession. Where possible, provide specific, actionable, and practical
recommendations to the agencies and community to address these areas."

DATA ANALYSIS PROGRAM AWARDS 
 
To support the needs of the Mars science community, the USGS
Astrogeology Science Center is providing HiRISE DTMs by request and at
no charge for funded ROSES 2020 Mars Data Analysis Program proposals.
Investigators are responsible for identification and selection of
appropriate HiRISE stereopairs, and must coordinate with USGS personnel
before proposal submission to obtain a Confirmation of Technical
Specification Letter. DTMs will only be generated for funded proposals.
Technical requirements can be found at the USGS Astrogeology Planetary
Photogrammetry site:

JOB ANNOUNCEMENT: UNIVERSITY OF OKLAHOMA, POSTDOCTORAL RESEARCHER

The School of Geosciences at the University of Oklahoma is seeking a
Postdoctoral Researcher to work with a diverse team of planetary
scientists, geoscientists, geoengineers, and social scientists on a
2-year project aimed at identifying, empowering, and rewarding
diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) champions within the geosciences
by aligning hiring, promotion, award, and other evaluation systems with
institutional and community goals to promote diversity and inclusion
within the Geosciences, including Planetary Science. The postdoc will
work with the proposal team to survey programs nationally and interview
faculty in focus departments to establish how faculty are currently
evaluated in geoscience departments, then determine how DEI efforts fit
within evaluation, tenure, promotion, and award frameworks. This
postdoc is funded 75% by an NSF grant, with additional funding provided
by endowed funds. We expect the postdoc to spend 0.75 FTE working on
this project, with the remaining 0.25 FTE available to pursue other
research interests. We are open to flexible work arrangements,
including a possible remote postdoc. For more information and
application instructions, please visit our website:

THE LUNAR SURFACE INNOVATION CONSORTIUM - VIRTUAL FALL MEETING
 
The Lunar Surface Innovation Consortium (LSIC) Fall Meeting will be
held virtually on October 14-15 2020. It will feature keynote
addresses, working sessions, and technical poster presentations. The
event will center on the interrelationships between the six LSIC focus
areas, especially in the context of surface power. We invite abstracts
describing technical capabilities within the six LSIC focus areas, as
well as those that identify lunar surface technology needs and assess
the readiness of relative systems and components. The six LSIC
technical focus areas are:

Dust Mitigation
Excavation & Construction
Extreme Access
Extreme Environments
In Situ Resource Utilization
Surface Power

Other topics of interest include defining the parameters and
constraints of the architecture required to support a sustained
presence on the lunar surface, as well as economic and policy
considerations. All abstracts are due by 11:59PM EDT on September 11,
2020. Contributed abstracts will be presented as posters or as short
lightning talks. They can be submitted at:
