[NASA] EXPRESSION OF INTEREST (EOI): SMD CALL FOR AUGMENTATIONS AND 
FUNDED EXTENSIONS

SMD announced that it would be accepting requests for funded extensions
and augmentations to existing awards to help make up for increased
costs directly attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic. SMD's priorities
for funding extensions and augmentations are in an SMD policy document,
"Augmentations and Funded Extensions in Response to COVID-19."

In order to estimate the size of this new program, SMD asks currently
funded researchers who may request an extension or augmentation to
submit an "Expression of Interest" (EOI) by August 21, 2020 as a Notice
of Intent (NOI) in response to NNH20ZDA010L via NSPIRES. Full text of
the EOI and response instructions:

https://nspires.nasaprs.com/external/solicitations/summary.do?solId=%7B2F320E44-5D23-176F-C195-597F32FBBC9D%7D&path=&method=init

A new program element, Solicitation NNH20ZDA001N, is expected to be
entitled "SMD Post-COVID Recovery" with requests for augmentations and
funded grant extensions due to be submitted after October 1, 2020.

Questions concerning general ROSES-2020 policies and procedures,
including this Expression of Interest, should be emailed to
sara@nasa.gov and use as the subject line "SMD call for Augmentations
and Funded Extensions, Solicitation: NNH20ZDA010L".

[NASA] PDS: MARS RECONNAISSANCE ORBITER CRISM MTRDR AND TER RELEASE 14

PDS announces Release 14 of Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter CRISM Targeted
Empirical Data Record (TER) and Map-projected Targeted Reduced Data
Record (MTRDR) products, at:

https://pds-geosciences.wustl.edu/missions/mro/crism.htm

This release fills in data from January 18, 2008 through August 8,
2008. TER products are image cubes derived from CRISM hyperspectral 
targeted observations, post-processed to standardize the illumination 
and observation geometry and remove atmospheric gas absorptions and
instrument artifacts. MTRDRs are the same products map-projected using
terrain models of the Martian surface.

MARS 2020 JEZERO CRATER LANDING SITE PRODUCTS 

The USGS Astrogeology Science Center has generated Context Camera (CTX)
and High-Resolution Imaging Science Experiment (HiRISE) Digital Terrain
Models (DTM) and orthoimage mosaics in support of Mars 2020 Terrain
Relative Navigation (TRN). TRN allows small-scale hazards to be present
in the landing ellipse, providing greater flexibility in the final
landing location. In support of TRN, the USGS has generated DTM and
orthoimage mosaics derived from three CTX stereo pairs. The 6 m/pixel
CTX orthoimage mosaic will be onboard the spacecraft and will be the
"truth" dataset that TRN will use to orient itself relative to the
surface during EDL. In addition, the USGS has generated HiRISE DTM and
orthoimage mosaics based on six HiRISE stereo pairs. This 25 cm/pixel
HiRISE mosaic is the basemap onto which landing hazards identified by
the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (e.g., rock fields and regions of high
slope) were mapped. This hazard map will be onboard the spacecraft and
used to determine the safest landing location. These maps are available
to the scientific community and the Mars 2020 team to support mission
operations and scientific investigations.

PLANETARY SCIENCE EDUCATION SESSION AT GSA THIS FALL

If you are interested in planetary science and education, please
consider submitting an abstract to the following session for this
fall's GSA:

T. 124 To Boldly Go: Thoughts, Approaches, and Examples for Teaching
Planetary Science and Integrating Students into the Research Process.

The goal of this session is to start a conversation about pedagogical
approaches folks use when teaching about planetary science at all
levels (K through grad school). Because the content we teach is
constantly changing/being updated, what are the core ideas we want to
make sure our students walk away with in planetary courses and what are
the best ways to do that? Similarly, what approaches do faculty take
when trying to teach planetary-related research methods to their
students?

To submit an abstract or to find out more about all the great planetary
sessions offered at GSA this year, please visit: 

https://community.geosociety.org/gsa2020/home

Abstract submission deadline is August 4.

INVITATION TO FREE INTERSTELLAR PROBE WEBINAR

Please join the Interstellar Probe Study Team for another installment
of the Interstellar Probe Study Webinar series on Thursday (August 6)
at noon EDT via Zoom.

Title: Possibilities for Planetary Science and Astrophysics

Panelists:

Pontus Brandt: Project Scientist, Interstellar Probe Study, JHUAPL
Kirby Runyon: Planetary Science Lead, Interstellar Probe Study, JHUAPL
Abi Rymer: Exoplanet Science Lead, Interstellar Probe Study, JHUAPL
Casey Lisse: Astrophysics Lead, Interstellar Probe Study, JHUAPL
 
The panelists will discuss the science opportunities in planetary
science and astrophysics of an Interstellar Probe mission. This
includes the possibilities to view Kuiper Belt objects and dwarf
planets, the chance to view our Solar System as an exoplanetary
analogue, and astrophysical opportunities to measure the extragalactic
background light and study the circum-solar dust disk to further our
understanding of planetary system formation.

Following the presentations there will be a question and answer
session.

CRAFTING LIFE DETECTION SCIENCE: NFOLD WEBINAR SERIES AND VIRTUAL 
WORKSHOP 

Join the Center for Life Detection and NfoLD as we take the next step
toward a community-sourced framework for life detection beyond Earth.
The Life Detection Forum project is an effort to foster the
community-level dialog needed for development of such a framework and,
on that basis, build an online platform to centralize and promote the
exchange of information, ideas, and dialog relating to life detection
science and technology.

To participate in this foundational effort to craft the framework for
future life detection science, please view the introductory webinar by
CLD Lead Tori Hoehler, archived at:

https://www.nfold.org/webinars

Fill out this survey indicating your interest in participating in the 
workshop:

POSTDOCTORAL RESEARCH POSITION AT THE UNIVERSITY OF OSLO, NORWAY

A two-year position as Postdoctoral Research Fellow is available in the
"Comparative Planetology" Team of the Centre for Earth Evolution and
Dynamics at the University of Oslo, Norway. The position concerns
modeling the interior dynamics and evolution of terrestrial and icy
planetary bodies and how these link to surface expressions. The
research is integrated in the "PLATONICS" project led by Dr. Tobias
Rolf. Depending on the candidate's background, one can choose between 
two potential research topics:

1) The role of rheological damage in the generation and diversity of
planetary surface tectonics, and
2) Deformation of the outer shells of icy satellites and material
transport across them.
