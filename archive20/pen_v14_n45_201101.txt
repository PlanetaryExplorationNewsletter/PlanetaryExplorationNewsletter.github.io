JPL RESEARCH SCIENTIST II, PLANETARY AND EXOPLANETARY ATMOSPHERES

Location: Pasadena, CA

The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology, 
invites applications for a staff Scientist position in observational 
studies of the atmospheres of the Gas and Ice Giant planets from 
ground-based and airborne facilities. It is expected that the 
successful candidate will develop an independently funded research 
program and will pursue new lines of research focusing on the dynamics 
and chemistry of the giant planets of the Solar System.

The position requires a Ph.D. in planetary science, planetary physics, 
astronomy, or related scientific discipline, along with demonstrated 
experience in conducting observations with large ground-based or 
airborne telescopes, with a successful track record and strong interest 
in applying those efforts to problems related to planetary science. The 
successful candidate will have a demonstrated professional reputation 
as a productive researcher with a track record of publications in 
peer-reviewed journals.

IAU PROCEEDINGS VOLUME DEDICATED TO LABORATORY ASTROPHYSICS

We are happy to announce the publication of "Laboratory Astrophysics: 
from Observations to Interpretation", the proceedings of the first 
topical symposium on Laboratory Astrophysics sponsored by the 
International Astronomical Union. This volume of Proceedings devoted 
to Laboratory Astrophysics and Astrochemistry is a collection of over 
500 pages of science articles with contributions from leading 
scientists in the field describing the current state-of-the-art in 
this multidisciplinary discipline (see links below for more details). 
This volume constitutes an invaluable reference for the community at 
large and will, hopefully, be a first in a long series of IAU 
Proceedings devoted to Laboratory Astrophysics. 

Sincerely, 

Farid Salama & Harold Linnartz

ISGS ISIS NEWS

ISIS 4.3.0 release is scheduled for end of October. For instructions on 
installing or upgrading, see:

http://bit.ly/isisinstall 

A new Request for Comment (RFC) has been posted concerning the ISIS 
programming API around BLOB data types. The proposed changes are not 
anticipated to impact users, but may impact API consumers. For 
additional information, please see:

REQUEST FOR FEEDBACK ON ISIS RELEASE PROCESS AND LONG TERM SUPPORT

The Technical Committee for the USGS-Astrogeology ISIS software is 
requesting feedback on its release process.

Overview: For a few months, we are actively soliciting input from the 
community of ISIS users to help determine the pace and requirements of 
ISIS releases. This request will be used, by members of the ISIS TC, 
to develop a plan for the ISIS release cadence and to determine if and 
how a long-term support (LTS) model may be implemented by the ISIS 
project.

We are soliciting user feedback on the ISIS release cycle in order to 
better define release requirements. Specifically we want to know how 
you interact with ISIS releases, the life-cycle or update cadence that 
you use with ISIS, and your expectations for release stability through 
one or more user stories. In the context of this request, user stories 
are at most five sentences summarizing generally who you are 
(a persona), what release requirements would fulfill your needs, and 
why this story fulfills your needs.

Please provide feedback at:

PLANETARY DATA ECOSYSTEM REQUEST FOR INFORMATION

The NASA Planetary Science Division is conducting an independent review 
of the Planetary Data Ecosystem (PDE), defined as the ad hoc connected 
framework of activities and products that are built upon and support 
the data collected by planetary space missions and research programs 
which are primarily NASA funded. Many familiar tools and databases are 
part of the PDE, including (but not limited to): ADS, AstroMat, DAPs, 
data policies & standards, JMars, JPL Horizons, MAPSIT, NASA Github, 
PDS, Planetary Geologic Mapping, Planetary Photojournal, Quickmap, 
RPIFs, and USGS Astrogeology ISIS3. The PDE Independent Review Board 
will review the current state of the PDE and provide findings and 
prioritized, actionable recommendations that will be used to develop 
an optimal PDE long-term strategy. To this end, NASA is seeking 
information and gathering community feedback on the PDE via a Request 
for Information (RFI), with responses due November 9, 2020. We 
encourage the planetary sciences community to provide input via this 
RFI. The full text of the RFI and response instructions can be found

Earth's radiation belt and ionospheric phenomena, 
(3) analysis of Parker Solar Probe data to study near-Sun solar wind 
plasma and field phenomena, and 
(4) Mars data analysis with key interest in the Langmuir Probe and 
Waves (LPW) data from the MAVEN mission.

The candidates must hold Ph.D. in physics or similar discipline. The 
candidate should indicate their research interests, and how they could 
enhance the research projects above. Depending on the science topic, 
demonstration of their skills in data analysis, MHD/PIC simulation, or 
machine learning is highly desirable.

[NASA] ROSES-20 AMENDMENT: COLDTECH - AUTONOMY, COMMUNICATIONS, AND 
RADIATION-HARD DEVICES

The goal of the Concepts for Ocean worlds Life Detection Technology 
(COLDTech) Program is to develop and advance the maturity of 
spacecraft technologies required for exploration of ocean worlds such 
as Europa and Enceladus. For this particular program element, C.26 
COLDTech: Autonomy, Communications, and Radiation-Hard Devices, the 
specific technologies sought are 1) autonomy for landed operations, 
2) technology to enable communication through many kilometers of ice 
thickness; and 3) radiation-hard digital devices. Proposals are 
expected to consider the practicality of incorporating the technical 
advances into flight missions, i.e., mass, volume, power, 
computational resources, and data rates will be constrained on typical 
planetary science missions so proposed technologies should aim to 
minimize their use.

Proposals to this program will be taken by a two-step process in which 
the Notice of Intent is replaced by a required Step-1 proposal 
submitted by an organization Authorized Organizational Representative. 
Only proposers who submit a Step-1 proposal are eligible to submit a 
Step-2 (full) proposal. See Section 3 for details. Step-1 proposals are 
due December 1, 2020 and Step-2 proposals are due February 19, 2021.
