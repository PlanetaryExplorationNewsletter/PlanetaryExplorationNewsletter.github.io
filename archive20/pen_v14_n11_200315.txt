ASTEROIDS, COMETS, METEORS CONFERENCE - CANCELLED

After much thought and consideration, we have made the decision to 
cancel and reschedule the Asteroids, Comets, Meteors Conference that 
0as to be held June 14-19, 2020, in Flagstaff, Arizona, due to the 
rapid spread of and uncertainty surrounding the coronavirus. The 
welfare and safety of our community and staff is very important to us.
 
Watch for updates on rescheduled dates. All participants should cancel 
their current hotel reservations and travel arrangements for 
June 14-19, 2020.

FROM SOLAR SYSTEM TO EXOPLANETS (TOEIII) - EARLY REGISTRATION + 
COVID-19

We would like to announce the change of the deadline for the early 
registration for the conference that we are organizing in Portugal 
(June 1-5, 2020).

Early registration deadline is now set for 31 March.

Regarding COVID-19, As of today, there is no restriction coming from 
the Portuguese government. Therefore, the organization of the 
conference continues as planned from the 1st to the 5th of June. 
However, it is difficult to predict how the situation will evolve. We 
are thus keeping a close eye on restrictions regarding international 
travels and meetings. 

If the conference has to be canceled, the registration fees will be 
100% refunded. Consequently, we encourage you to submit abstracts and 
register, but we advise that you delay your bookings [travel and 
hotels] as much as possible.

Towards Other Earth III: from Solar System to Exoplanets
When: 1-5 June 2020
Where: Lamego, Douro Valley, Portugal
Venue: Theater Ribeiro Conceicao, Lamego, Portugal
What: Atmosphere, Interior, formation and evolution of planets and 
planetary systems. The Solar System Planets and Exoplanets communities 
aim at answering similar questions, but seldom interact due to the 
different datasets they have access to.

EPSC 2020 SESSION: ENVIRONMENTS OF OUTER-PLANET MOONS - PARTICLES, 
PLASMA, FIELDS AND DUST

EPSC dates: September 27 - October 2, 2020
Location: Granada

This session focuses on outstanding questions on the environments of 
the moons of outer planets: including the neutral particles (e.g. 
torii, atmospheres, exospheres, and plumes), electromagnetic fields, 
dust and plasma, and the interaction of the moons with their 
environments. Abstracts on all outer planet moons are welcome, 
including those of Jupiter and Saturn (e.g. Europa, Ganymede, 
Enceladus, Rhea, and Titan) and the not-well explored moons of 
Neptune and Uranus.

Prior developments in this field have lead to significant 
discoveries (e.g. subsurface oceans) and have given rise to new open 
questions (e.g. active plumes on Europa). Considering the 
unprecedented opportunity to study these subjects with the upcoming 
ESA's JUICE and NASA's Europa Clipper missions it is essential to 
bring together the space community on this topic. This session is 
important to maximize the scientific output of past and current 
missions, in support of the future missions.

Convenors: Hans Huybrighs, Shahab Fatemi, Mika Holmberg, 
Christina Plainaki and Audrey Vorburger

POSTDOCTORAL SCHOLAR POSITION AT NORTHERN ARIZONA UNIVERSITY

The Habitability, Atmospheres, and Biosignatures Laboratory 
(http://www.hablab.net) in the Department of Astronomy and Planetary 
Science at Northern Arizona University seeks a postdoctoral scholar to 
join the research group. The HABLab works primarily on understanding 
techniques for characterizing exoplanetary atmospheres for signs of 
habitability and life. These investigations are carried out using 
spacecraft data as well as a variety of tools for modeling planetary 
climate and radiation. We seek candidates that will explore 
applications of retrieval analyses to simulated direct imaging 
observations of Earth-like exoplanets to constrain surface properties 
and habitability. The successful candidate will carry out research 
related to the qualifications listed. The successful candidate is 
expected to publish scientific papers and may choose to mentor 
undergraduate and/or graduate students (though this is not required).

Applications are due by March 30, 2020. For additional information,

RESEARCH ASSOCIATE IN DATA SCIENCE AND SCIENTIFIC PROGRAMMING

Deadline: March 24, 2020

The department of Geophysics of GFZ German Research Centre for 
Geosciences invites applications for 1 position of Research Associate 
in Data Science and Scientific Programming in the group "Magnetospheric 
Physics".

Candidates should have a Ph.D. in space physics, plasma physics, or 
related field. Experience in programming (in particular in code 
development), as well as a strong knowledge of programming languages 
and operating systems is also required. Experience in machine 
learning, data mining, and data assimilation is a plus.

For more details please see: 

https://tinyurl.com/PDGFZ-2020

The work will be performed in the context of the EU Horizon 
2020-funded consortium PAGER led by GFZ Potsdam. The primary aim of 
PAGER is to provide space weather predictions initiated from 
observations on the Sun and to predict radiation in space and its 
effects on satellite infrastructure. The PAGER team will combine 
state-of-the-art models covering all the way from the Solar surface to 
the Earth's inner magnetosphere. We will also run ensembles of 
physics-based and machine-learning models to make probabilistic 
predictions of the space weather conditions 1-2 days in advance.
