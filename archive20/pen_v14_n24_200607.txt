EPSC2020 SESSION EXO3: FROM PROTOPLANETARY DISKS TO SMALL BODIES, 
PLANETS AND THEIR ATMOSPHERES

How and when planets did formed in the Solar System and in extra-solar 
systems? Are protoplanetary disks massive enough to form the planets' 
cores? And what chemical composition do planets and primitive Solar 
System bodies inherit from their natal environment? Is the chemical 
composition passed unaltered from the earliest stages of the formation 
of a star to its disk and then to the bodies which assemble in the 
disk? Or does it reflect chemical processes occurring in the disk 
and/or during the planet formation process? 

The aim of this session is to review the latest results on 
protoplanetary disks; to foster a comparison with the recent outcomes 
of small bodies space missions (e.g. Rosetta, Dawn, Hayabusa 2, 
OSIRIS-REX) and ground-based observations; and to discuss how these 
will affect the current models of planet formation and can guide us to 
investigate the origin of planets and small bodies and of their 
chemical composition.

EPSC2020 SESSION EXO4: EXOPLANET OBSERVATIONS, MODELLING AND 
EXPERIMENTS, CHARACTERIZATION OF THEIR ATMOSPHERES

The field of extrasolar planets is one of the most rapidly changing 
areas of astrophysics and planetary science. Ground-based surveys and 
dedicated space missions have already discovered more than 4000 
planets with many more detections expected in the near future. A key 
challenge is now the characterisation of their atmospheres in order to 
answer to the questions: what are these worlds actually like and what 
processes govern their formation and evolution?

To answer these questions, a broad range of skills and expertise are 
required, stretching from Solar System science to statistical 
astrophysics, from ground-based observations to spacecraft 
measurements, and atmospheric/interior/orbital modelling. The numerous 
studies conducted in the past twenty years have unveiled a large 
diversity of atmospheres. The next generation of space and ground 
based facilities (e.g. E-ELT, JWST, and ARIEL) will characterise this 
multifarious population in stunning detail and challenge our current 
understanding. Both theoretical works and experimental measurements 
are required to prepare for such a change of scale.

EPSC2020 SESSION OPS4: ICY OCEAN WORLDS - PAST AND FUTURE EXPLORATIONS

Conveners: Gabriel Tobie, Carly Howett, Alice Lucchetti, 
Frank Postberg, Federico Tosi

The exploration of the outer Solar System by Galileo at Jupiter, 
Cassini-Huygens at Saturn, and New Horizons at Pluto-Charon, has 
revealed that several icy worlds harbor a subsurface salty ocean 
underneath their cold icy surface. By flying through the icy-vapor 
plume erupting from Enceladus' south pole, Cassini proceeded for the 
first time to the analysis of fresh materials coming from an 
extraterrestrial ocean, revealing its astrobiological potentials. Even
if there is no direct evidence yet, similar oceanic habitats might also
be present within Europa, Ganymede and Titan, which will be
characterized by future missions currently under development for the
exploration of icy Galilean moons (JUICE, Europa Clipper) and of
Saturn's moon Titan (Dragonfly).

Understanding these ocean worlds requires input from a variety of
scientific disciplines: planetary geology and geophysics, atmospheric
physics, life sciences, magnetospheric environment, space weathering, 
as well as supporting laboratory studies, numerical simulations,
preparatory studies for future missions and technology developments in
instrumentation and engineering. We welcome abstracts that span this
full breadth of disciplines.

EPSC2020 SESSION OPS5: ENVIRONMENTS OF OUTER-PLANET MOONS - PARTICLES,
PLASMA, FIELDS AND DUST

Dates: September 21, 2020 - October 9, 2020

Abstracts are due June 24, 2020, 13:00 CEST

https://meetingorganizer.copernicus.org/EPSC2020/session/38528

This session focuses on outstanding questions on the environments of 
the moons of outer planets: including the neutral particles (e.g.,
torii, atmospheres, exospheres, and plumes), electromagnetic fields, 
dust and plasma, and the interaction of the moons with their 
environments. Abstracts on all outer planet moons are welcome, 
including those of Jupiter and Saturn and the not-well explored moons 
of Neptune and Uranus.

The different topics include (but are not limited to): active 
processes (e.g., plumes and volcanoes), moon-magnetosphere 
interaction, induced fields by subsurface oceans, surface weathering 
of the moons, neutral exosphere and ionosphere, dust environment, 
preparatory studies for future missions, supporting laboratory 
studies, simulation studies and observations 
(ground-based/remote/in-situ). Missions of particular relevance 
include Galileo, Voyager, Cassini-Huygens, Hisaki, Juno, JUICE and 
Europa Clipper.

Please help us spread the word about this session by forwarding this 
message to your colleagues and in particular to any early career 
researcher in your network that is working on a relevant topic.

POSTDOC POSITION IN PLANETARY SEISMOLOGY

The Geophysical Institute at the University of Alaska Fairbanks has an 
immediate opening for a postdoctoral researcher in the field of 
planetary seismology. The new hire will engage in a project to 
establish likely bounds on the nature and amount of seismic activity 
on Venus, assemble a catalog of potential Venus-analog events using 
records from a variety of traditional and non-traditional seismic 
sources recorded in Alaska and elsewhere, and then use the catalog to 
evaluate the viability of potential instrument designs and analysis 
algorithms for an eventual seismograph on Venus. This is a one-year 
project, but the expectation is that a strong performer could 
transition into a multi-year position conducting a TBD mix of 
terrestrial and planetary seismology. Candidate is expected to be 
well-versed in earthquake seismology; familiarity with planetary 
science is desirable but not required. More information about the 
position can be found here:

Directions on how to apply: 

https://careers.alaska.edu/en-us/job/514947/planetary-seismology-postdoctoral-fellow  

Review of applications will begin June 22, but applications will be 
accepted until the position is filled; our desire is to have a person 
in place by late summer.

leadership role in other activities where community input on topics of 
interest is needed. Appointments are for either two or three year 
terms, such that roll-off is staggered. LEAG seeks to have an Executive 
Committee that is as diverse as the community, in terms of factors such 
as career stage, demographics, type of employer, and area of expertise. 
In particular, we are currently seeking members who can help lead in the 
following areas:

Lunar Science
Technology
Human Exploration 
Commercial
Early Career Secretary

If you are interested in serving on the LEAG Executive Committee, 
please email Brett Denevi (Brett.Denevi@jhuapl.edu) by 19 June 2020.

POSTDOCTORAL RESEARCHER IN PLANETARY MAGNETOSPHERIC PHYSICS 

Applications are now being accepted for two postdoctoral scientists to
work with the NASA/Goddard Space Flight Center Planetary Magnetospheres
Laboratory in Greenbelt, MD. The position is funded through the CRESST
II.

Position 1: The postdoctoral researcher will work for either the Juno
project with the primary responsibility of conducting analysis and
publishing the magnetometer results. In addition, the candidate will
assist with the magnetometer data validation and calibration.

Position 2: The data scientist's primary responsibility will be to
develop a data production pipeline for future magnetometer missions.
This involves taking raw magnetometer data, applying the appropriate
transformations and calibrations, and producing the final public data
products. The data scientist is encouraged to pursue their own research
interest.

Candidates for this position should have earned a Ph.D. in physics,
astronomy, planetary science, space physics, geosciences, or related
fields. Successful candidates should also have expertise with one or
more programming languages commonly used in space science and a
demonstrated track record in analyzing spaceflight data, especially
magnetometer data and experience with the NAIF SPICE software package
is highly desired.

Applications received by July 15, 2020 will receive the best
consideration.
