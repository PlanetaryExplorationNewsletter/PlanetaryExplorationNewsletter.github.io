IN MEMORIAM: H. J. MELOSH (1947-2020)

One of the giants of planetary science, H. J. Melosh, died unexpectedly
on 11 September 2020 at age 73. Through his students, postdocs and
collaborators, he brought a high level of physical rigor to the growing
field of planetary geology.

NASA MARS ARCHITECTURE STRATEGY WORKING GROUP FINAL REPORT
 
The final report from NASA's Mars Architecture Strategy Working Group
(MASWG) has been released by NASA. MASWG was charged by NASA's
Planetary Science Division with determining what could and should be
done in the scientific exploration of Mars beyond (i.e., in addition to
or after) the Mars Sample Return campaign. It recommended a
reinvigorated Mars Exploration Program that would address fundamental
science objectives on habitability and possible life, climate
evolution, and planetary evolution; relevant to Mars, the other
terrestrial planets, exoplanets, and planning for human exploration;
and utilizing the full range of spacecraft size classes from small
spacecraft up through New Frontiers-class.
 
The MASWG final report is available via the MEPAG web site, at:

MARS RECONNAISSANCE ORBITER CRISM MTRDR AND TER RELEASE 15

PDS announces Release 15 of Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter CRISM Targeted
Empirical Data Record (TER) and Map-projected Targeted Reduced Data
Record (MTRDR) products, at:

https://pds-geosciences.wustl.edu/missions/mro/crism.htm

This release fills in data from August 9 through November 8, 2008. 

TER products are image cubes derived from CRISM hyperspectral targeted
observations, post-processed to standardize the illumination and
observation geometry and remove atmospheric gas absorptions and
instrument artifacts. MTRDRs are the same products map-projected using
terrain models of the Martian surface.

EGU SESSION PS3.6: VOLCANISM AND TECTONISM ACCROSS THE SOLAR SYSTEM

In 2021, EGU will be hosting vEGU21: Gather Online (#vEGU21), a fully 
virtual meeting that will be held in place of the General Assembly in 
Vienna. The dates of vEGU21 will be 19-30 April 2021.

PS3.6 Volcanism and tectonism across the Solar System Session
Description: Volcanism and tectonism are two of the most ubiquitous
processes at work in the Solar System, shaping substantially the
surfaces of worlds as diverse as the terrestrial and dwarf planets,
main-belt asteroids, and icy satellites. This session will host
observational, analytical, theoretical, and analogue fieldwork research
into any aspect of planetary volcanic and tectonic activity. We welcome
submissions that compare landforms and processes on multiple bodies,
geochemical and chronological data from planetary material, results
obtained from analogue and numerical models, and how lessons from
specific studies can be applied to understanding volcanism and
tectonism across the Solar System.

You are invited to submit an abstract at:

https://meetingorganizer.copernicus.org/EGU21/abstractsubmission/40044

The deadline for abstract submission is 13 Jan 2021, 13:00 CET. Please
note that EGU has a One-Abstract Rule.

Conveners: Petr Broz, Sylvain Breton, Ernst Hauber

AGU TOWN HALL
 
Session Title: The Present and Future of NASA's Citizen Science Program
Time: Friday, December 4, 2020 10-11 a.m. EST (7-8 a.m. PST)
 
From conducting projects designed to study our planet's biodiversity to
studying the Sun and finding planets outside our Solar System,
NASA-funded citizen science projects harness the collective strength of
the public to analyze data and conduct scientific research. NASA-funded
citizen science projects have engaged roughly 1.5 million volunteers
and resulted in numerous scientific discoveries. This AGU town hall
provides an opportunity for researchers to learn about NASA resources
available to help launch successful citizen science projects.
NASA-funded researchers will also share the latest and greatest
information regarding popular NASA supported citizen science projects.

Presenters: J. Green, V. Chirayath, M. Kuchner, E. MacDonald, and M.
Santos
