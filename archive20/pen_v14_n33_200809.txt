MARS EXPLORATION SCIENCE MONTHLY NEWSLETTER FOR AUGUST 2020

On behalf of R. Aileen Yingst (MEPAG Chair), Rich Zurek, Brandi 
Carrier, and Dave Beaty of the Mars Program Science Office, the August 
2020 edition of the Mars Exploration Science Monthly Newsletter can be 
found attached and on the web at: 

http://mepag.jpl.nasa.gov 

In this newsletter, we continue to update the upcoming conference 
schedule with postponements, cancellations, and conversions to virtual 
meetings.

We hope everyone remains safe and healthy within these stressful, 
rapidly evolving, social-isolating times.

Please send your Mars community announcements and calendar items for 
inclusion in the newsletter to Barbara at:

DECADAL SURVEY WHITE PAPER ON THE SATURN RING SKIMMER MISSION CONCEPT

You are invited to support a white paper describing the Saturn Ring 
Skimmer mission concept, the next step to explore Saturn's rings, 
atmosphere, interior, and inner magnetosphere.  

In addition to addressing fundamental questions about Saturn and its 
rings, as well as giant planets and astrophysical disk systems in 
general, the Saturn Ring Skimmer would reveal how the rings, 
magnetosphere, atmosphere, and interior of the planet operate as an 
inter-connected system. We advocate that this mission concept be 
studied in depth as a potential option for the New Frontiers program.

The paper is available at: 

https://www.seti.org/RingSkimmerWP20

A form to register your support is available at: 

https://www.seti.org/RingSkimmerWP20_support

The paper will be submitted on August 15 to the Planetary Science and 
Astrobiology Decadal Survey.

[NASA] FAQS FOR SMD'S AUGMENTATIONS AND FUNDED EXTENSIONS - EXPRESSION 
OF INTEREST

Solicitation Number: NNH20ZDA010L

To stimulate response from all types of currently funded Science 
Mission Directorate awards, e.g., grants, contracts, cooperative 
agreements, inter-agency transfers, whether inside or outside NASA, SMD 
has added Frequently Asked Questions and Answers (FAQS) for "Expression 
of Interest" (EOI) SMD call for Augmentations and Funded Extensions on 
the NASA Solicitation and Proposal Integrated Review and Evaluation 
System (NSPIRES). 

EOIs are due by 11:59 p.m. Eastern on August 21, 2020 as a Notice of 
Intent (NOI) in response to NNH20ZDA010L via NSPIRES. Download the full 
text of the EOI, its FAQs and response instructions at:

https://nspires.nasaprs.com/external/solicitations/summary.do?solId=%7B2F320E44-5D23-176F-C195-597F32FBBC9D%7D&path=&method=init

SMD will not provide any feedback on a submitted Expression of 
Interest. NASA SMD will keep EOI contents confidential and will use 
responses to improve management of the augmentation and extension 
processes.

If after reviewing the FAQs, additional questions regarding the 
Expression of Interest remain, please email sara@nasa.gov and use as 
the subject line "SMD call for Augmentations and Funded Extensions: 
NNH20ZDA010L".

CALL FOR PAPERS TO A FOCUS ISSUE IN THE PLANETARY SCIENCE JOURNAL 
DEDICATED TO PAPERS HIGHLIGHTING LANDED LUNAR MISSION CONCEPTS AND 
HIGH-PRIORITY LANDING SITES

New Extended Submission Deadline: 11/1/2020

Please direct questions to the Special Issue Coordinators: Barbara 
Cohen (Barbara.A.Cohen@nasa.gov) and Maria Banks 
(maria.e.banks@nasa.gov).

Planetary Science Journal submission site: 

https://journals.aas.org/planetary-science-journal

When submitting, please indicate the special issue: "Lunar Mission 
Concepts and High-Priority Landing Sites‚Äù in the comments section.

Description of focus for special issue:

This special issue is dedicated to papers highlighting lunar mission 
concepts, data analysis, and high-priority landing sites. A successful 
paper should bring together elements of lunar data analysis (e.g. 
geology, site selection, new analyses), along with a lunar mission or 
instrument/payload concept (science, instrumentation, mission design, 
etc). Surface mission concepts should contain a science justification 
for a robotic (or human-assisted) mission, and a detailed analysis of 
one or more candidate landing sites to show the existence of a safe and 
interesting potential site for the mission. Orbital mission concepts 
should include new or updated lunar data analysis or interpretation 
that supports the mission concept along with its science justification. 
Mission concepts need not be highly mature, but should clearly describe 
the science case.

ATTEND THE DPS MEETING THIS YEAR

Please join us at the virtual DPS meeting this year, Oct 26-30! It's a 
great opportunity to attend DPS, perhaps for the first time.

Meeting abstracts are due August 12. You do not need to submit an 
abstract to attend the meeting.

Registration rates for this year's virtual meeting are lower than for 
in-person meetings. Some financial support for meeting attendance is 
available: 

https://dps.aas.org/news/hartmann-grant-dps-52

DPS offers affiliate memberships to members of numerous partner 
organizations including NSBP, NSHP, and SACNAS. 

DPS is the American Astronomical Society's (AAS) Division for 
Planetary Sciences. The DPS is the world's largest professional society 
of planetary scientists. The DPS represents the interests of planetary 
scientists at all stages of their careers. It promotes the advancement 
of planetary science to stakeholders including NASA and other government 
agencies, the public, and federal, state, and local legislatures. As a 
professional society, the DPS advocates on issues that affect the 
quality of work and educational environments, as well as the specific 
conditions that planetary scientists need to do their work.
