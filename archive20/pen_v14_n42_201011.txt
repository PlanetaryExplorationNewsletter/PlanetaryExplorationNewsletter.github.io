MEPAG STEERING COMMITTEE OPENING FOR EDIA REPRESENTATIVE

MEPAG is soliciting an Equity, Diversity, Inclusion and Accessibility 
(EDIA) representative to serve on the MEPAG Steering Committee. This is 
a full Steering Committee position.

Roles and responsibilities include providing expertise and input to the 
Committee on its activities; working with the rest of the MEPAG 
Steering Committee to determine measurable actions the Mars community 
will take to increase its equity, diversity, inclusion and 
accessibility; tracking progress on EDIA initiatives; and serving as 
one of two MEPAG representatives on the EDIA Working Group Steering 
Committee. This member would fully support the purposes and initiatives 
of MEPAG on the MEPAG website.

Like all MEPAG positions, this is a volunteer role. It is expected the 
time commitment will be ~5 hours per month and the term is expected to 
last at least 3 years.

Interested applicants should send a 1-page CV and a short statement 
describing commitment to, and experience with, both Mars exploration 
and EDIA issues, and how you would work towards inclusion and equity 
within the Mars community to mepag_edia@jpl.nasa.gov by October 14, 
2020.

Sincerely,

R. Aileen Yingst

PLANETARY SCIENCE JOURNAL FOCUS ISSUE: OCEAN WORLDS - MOTIVATIONS FOR A 
MULTI-DECADAL EXPLORATION PROGRAM

This Focus Issue aims to demonstrate the need for a coordinated 
exploration of the Ocean Worlds, augmenting the content of white papers 
submitted for the 2023-2032 Decadal Survey with focused discussion and 
community contributions. We welcome submissions reviewing the current 
state of knowledge for particular bodies, outstanding science questions 
to be addressed at or within the Ocean Worlds, as well recent 
advancements in instrumentation, technologies, and techniques for Ocean 
Worlds exploration. 

We ask authors to consider how their contributed work may fit into or 
motivate the coordinated exploration of Ocean Worlds through a 
formalized program. This may be through sustained research, development, 
and analysis funding, enhanced flight opportunities, or the 
establishment of fixed, long-term priorities. Potential topics include 
but are not limited to the following:

- Science motivation by target or subdiscipline
- Mission concepts or programmatic strategies
- Instrumentation, technologies, and/or techniques
- Technology gaps or needs
- Analog testing sites, technologies, and objectives

Deadline for submission: February 10, 2021

LOOKING FOR DPS MEMBERS TO CONNECT VIRTUALLY WITH CLASSROOMS AND OTHER 
GROUPS IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE DPS MEETING THIS OCTOBER

In conjunction with the American Astronomical Society Division for 
Planetary Science (DPS) meeting in October, we are looking for 
scientists to give virtual presentations to classrooms and other 
community groups between October 19 and October 30. These virtual 
sessions, lasting 30 minutes to an hour, are intended to connect 
classrooms and clubs directly with scientists so you can share more 
about your science and science careers and give students a direct 
connection to a scientist. You can sign up for one or more sessions 
here:

OPENINGS ON OUTER PLANETS ANALYSIS GROUP (OPAG) STEERING COMMITTEE

Several openings are available on the OPAG steering committee to 
replace members who will be rolling off. All interested candidates are 
encouraged to apply, particularly those with expertise in Giant Planet 
Interiors, Ocean Worlds & Cryospheres (field and experimental), 
Astrobiology, and those able to represent Science Mission Directorate 
Cross-Divisional interests.

Nominations will be accepted starting on October 9, 2020 and will be 
due by November 9, 2020. New members will start their service in time

WEISS POSTDOCTORAL RESEARCH FELLOWSHIP POSITION AT RICE UNIVERSITY

The Department of Earth, Environmental and Planetary Sciences at Rice 
University invites applications for the Weiss Postdoctoral Research 
Fellowship. We are seeking candidates with independent research 
interests that intersect with one or more faculty within our 
department. Applicants are requested to develop a proposal of research 
to be undertaken during the fellowship period. The principal selection 
criteria are scientific excellence, a clearly expressed research plan 
to address questions at the forefront of their field of study, 
independent research ideas and new directions beyond the applicant's 
Ph.D. work, and research synergies with at least one faculty. 
Preference will be given to applicants whose proposals demonstrate 
independence and originality.

A Ph.D. is required at the time of appointment, but candidates must 
have received their Ph.D. no more than 3 years before their start date 
at Rice. Domestic and international applicants are welcome. The 
research fellowships will be supported for two years, pending
