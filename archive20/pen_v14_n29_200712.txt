[NASA] ROSES-20: PLANETARY SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY THROUGH
ANALOG RESEARCH (PSTAR) NOT SOLICITED THIS YEAR

Planetary Science and Technology Through Analog Research (PSTAR)
solicits proposals for investigations focused on exploring the relevant
environments on Earth in order to develop a sound technical and
scientific basis to conduct planetary research on other Solar System
bodies. The PSTAR program is a science-driven exploration program that
is expected to result in new science and operational/technological
capabilities to enable the next generation of planetary exploration.

PSTAR is converting to a biennial program and will not be solicited as
part of ROSES-20. It will be solicited in ROSES-21 and every other year
thereafter.

This Amendment will be posted on the NASA research opportunity homepage
at:

http://solicitation.nasaprs.com/ROSES2020

and will appear on SARA's ROSES blog at:

[NASA] ROSES-20: HABITABLE WORLDS NOT SOLICITED IN ROSES-2021

The goal of the Habitable Worlds program is to use knowledge of the
history of the Earth and the life upon it as a guide for determining
the processes and conditions that create and maintain habitable
environments and to search for ancient and contemporary habitable
environments and explore the possibility of extant life beyond the
Earth.

The Planetary Science Division plans that Habitable Worlds will not be
solicited next year in ROSES-2021. It is still solicited this year and
it is anticipated that it will be solicited every year after 2021. The
due dates for this year remain unchanged: Step-1 proposals are due
11/17/2020 and Step-2 proposals are due 01/15/2021.

AGU SESSION P006: CARBON ACROSS THE SOLAR SYSTEM ON THE EVE OF 
RETURNING ASTEROID SAMPLES

Studies of the existence and state of carbonaceous material on Solar
System bodies is at the forefront of planetary research. Samples of
low-albedo asteroid 162173 Ryugu are en route to the Earth on the
Hayabusa2 probe, and a rehearsal of the initial sample analysis is
planned. At this time, the OSIRIS-REx space probe sampling of
low-albedo asteroid 101955 Bennu has been rehearsed. As a framework for
these studies, telescopic, laboratory and theoretical studies of carbon
in all its forms have recently snowballed. The 2018 SSERVI Carbon in
the Solar System workshop launched a series of presentations and
discussions at various planetary science venues, enabling an
information exchange around the weathering of carbonaceous compounds in
response to thermal processes and irradiation, and what implications
these compositions have for understanding material processing in the
Solar System. We will generate and share ideas to support research and
the imminent arrival of new samples.

We invite abstracts to be submitted through July 29:

AGU SESSION P023: MERCURY - FROM MESSENGER TO BEPICOLOMBO

We are pleased to announce a session on Mercury at the 2020 AGU Fall
Meeting, December 7-11, 2020.

NASA's MESSENGER mission revolutionized our understanding of Mercury's
surface, interior, exosphere, magnetosphere, and heliospheric
environment. With the launch to Mercury of the ESA-JAXA BepiColombo
dual spacecraft mission to Mercury in October 2018, that understanding
is poised to soon take another major step forward. In this session, we
welcome contributions on data analysis, laboratory measurements,
ground-based observations, and theoretical developments that build on
the current state of knowledge of Mercury. We particularly welcome
papers on how questions raised by MESSENGER findings can be addressed
by future observations expected from BepiColombo, as well as how
measurements by BepiColombo during flybys of Earth and Venus in 2020
can be used to support investigations at Mercury.

Please consider submitting an abstract for this session. For more
information, visit:

AGU SESSION P024: MICRO TO MACRO INFRARED SPECTROSCOPY - LABORATORY, 
FIELD, AND REMOTE OBSERVATIONS

Infrared spectroscopy has transformed our view of the Solar System and
enabled discoveries including phyllosilicates on Mars, water on the
Moon, and salts on Europa. Nearly all planetary surface materials have
characteristic infrared vibrations and/or electronic transitions,
making this wavelength range optimal for determining surface or sample
composition using reflectance, emission, and transmission measurements.

Recent laboratory-curated infrared spectral libraries of
planetary-relevant materials and field analog studies have facilitated
a deeper understanding of remote sensing observations, fundamental
planetary processes, and surface composition and physical properties.
Technological advances resulting in higher spectral and spatial
resolution measurements, miniaturization of imaging spectrometers, and
improved atmospheric correction and data analysis techniques have
enabled novel measurements and discoveries throughout the Solar System.

This session brings together studies utilizing infrared datasets,
terrestrial analogs, and remote sensing observations which further
planetary surface research. We also invite abstracts on planetary
instrumentation development and data analysis algorithms. The abstract
deadline is July 29.

AGU SESSION P027: NEXT GENERATION PLANETARY GEODESY

Geodesy - the study of a planet's shape, orientation, and gravity field
- is one of the most powerful methods for investigating the formation,
evolution, structure, and active processes of Solar System bodies.
Geodetic measurements from robotic spacecraft missions have detected
Earth's hydrological cycle, revealed oceans of liquid water within icy
moons, probed the atmospheric dynamics of gas giants, and characterized
the deep structure of terrestrial planets. These missions have proven
that geodesy is not only an outstanding geophysical tool, but one that
can unlock advances in geology, climate change, hydrology,
geochemistry, and more.  

In this session, we welcome submissions that highlight new scientific
and technological developments in planetary geodesy, with an emphasis
on high priority questions in planetary science. Examples of relevant
topics include quantifying volatile reservoirs at Mars, atmospheric
dynamics at Venus, habitability of ocean worlds, and more. We aim to
capture the scientific diversity of geodetic investigations across the
Solar System.

Thank you,
Anton Ermakov (session chair)

AGU SESSION P032: PREPARING FOR THE NEXT VENUS MISSIONS

Several mature Venus mission concepts are under review within the US
and around the world that address the most fundamental questions about
the evolution of Earth-sized planets in our Solar System and beyond.
What science is needed to prepare for these missions? What fundamental
or applied analyses will help us maximize a new mission's science
return? We solicit papers that detail new science that supports
anticipated exploration of Venus using spectroscopy, radar and in situ
assets within the atmosphere and on the ground. This includes, but is
not limited to, laboratory and theoretical investigations of Venus
analogue materials, observations of Earth phenomena with specific
relevance to Venus, modeling of Venus environments, landing site
characterization, and Venus-relevant exoplanet observations.

The conveners invite abstracts to be submitted through July 29:

AGU SESSION P040: THE FUTURE OF PLANETARY ATMOSPHERIC, SURFACE, AND 
INTERIOR SCIENCE USING RADIO AND LASER LINKS

Radio science has been used to study Solar System phenomena and
fundamental physics for over five decades. The scope of this session
includes radio and optical science techniques to study ocean worlds,
planetary and small body interiors, the dynamics, composition, and
thermal structure of planetary atmospheres, to characterize the
scattering, electrical, and other properties of planetary surfaces, to
study Solar System dynamics, and to conduct tests in fundamental
physics. Of particular interest are presentations on radio science
investigations motivated by U.S. Planetary Science Decadal Survey white
papers. Relevant technology topics include but are not limited to the
design of small spacecraft networks and constellations, advances in
flight and ground instrumentation, advances in space clock
technologies, novel communications architectures including optical
links, advances in radio and laser technologies, and new techniques and
instrumentation for entry probe radio science.

AGU SESSION P042: THE NEW MARS UNDERGROUND (AND BEYOND) 3.0

Characterizing the Martian subsurface is of enormous interest to
geophysics, astrobiology, climatology, and human space exploration.
Recent scientific and technological advances have made this frontier a
fast growing scientific discipline and finally accessible. This session
covers the frontiers of Mars subsurface science and exploration,
including, but not limited to, studies of the potential for subsurface
life, evolution of planetary volatiles and crusts, characterization of
subsurface resources to support human missions, and the technologies
and mission concepts that finally enable Mars subsurface exploration.
We encourage contributions that explore the technological and
scientific synergies for subsurface science and exploration between
Mars and other planetary bodies: from synergies with lunar subsurface
science and in situ resource utilization through Artemis, icy worlds
where similar processes might occur and comparable technologies will
permit subsurface access, and the terrestrial subsurface (from deep
life to mining).

Please consider submitting an abstract to this session and forward the
session details to anyone interested.

AGU SESSION P048: UNRAVELING MYSTERIES ABOUT BODIES IN OUR SOLAR SYSTEM
AND BEYOND THROUGH LABORATORY EXPERIMENTS

Session ID: 105147 

Observations of Solar System bodies and exoplanets discover new
mysteries at an unprecedented pace that need solving. Spacecraft
missions have made stunning discoveries about planetary bodies, from
Mercury to Pluto and the planets and small bodies in between. However,
in many cases, theory cannot fully explain the observations due to a
dearth in relevant experimental information. This lack of the
appropriate laboratory measurements of material properties under the
appropriate conditions is slowly, and deliberately, being addressed,
adding new insights into fundamental processes responsible for shaping
our Solar System and beyond. New experimental results continue to come
from laboratories, yet many more experiments are needed to understand
many recent discoveries. This session solicits abstracts on results
from new laboratory experiments and concepts for needed laboratory
experiments, including new laboratory capabilities to help resolve
those mysteries around the nature of bodies that have arisen from
observations already made and from those planned.

Abstract deadline July 29:

AGU SESSION SM022: MOON-PLASMA INTERACTIONS THROUGHOUT THE SOLAR SYSTEM

This session focuses on observational and theoretical studies of the
interaction between the moons of our Solar System and the magnetized
plasmas incident upon them. This includes plasma interactions with the
solid surfaces, atmospheres, dust environments, and intrinsic/induced
magnetic fields of the moons, both inside and outside of their parent
planets' magnetospheres. Of special interest are results related to
in-situ field and particle measurements near Earth's Moon and from
Cassini's flybys of Saturn's icy satellites Enceladus, Rhea and Dione.
Studies deepening our understanding of the interconnection between
Titan's ionosphere and its highly dynamic magnetospheric environment
are also very welcome. The interaction of Jupiter's moons with the
ambient magnetospheric plasma will be addressed with a view to provide
support to the ongoing Juno Mission and the planning of synergistic
measurements for the upcoming JUICE and Europa Clipper missions.
Comparative studies of the various moon-plasma interaction scenarios
are particularly welcome.

This session is Co-Organized with Planetary Sciences.

POSTDOCTORAL RESEARCHER IN PLANETARY MAGNETOSPHERIC PHYSICS

Applications are now being accepted for two postdoctoral scientists to
work with the NASA/Goddard Space Flight Center Planetary Magnetospheres
Laboratory in Greenbelt, MD. The position is funded through the CRESST
II.

Position 1: The postdoctoral researcher will work for either the Juno
project with the primary responsibility of conducting analysis and
publishing the magnetometer results. In addition, the candidate will
assist with the magnetometer data validation and calibration.

Position 2: The data scientist's primary responsibility will be to
develop a data production pipeline for future magnetometer missions.

NEW COMICS ABOUT SEISMOLOGY

New educational tool explaining the propagation of seismic waves
through our planet is out. The Institute of Geophysics of the Czech
Academy of Sciences prepared an English version of the comics
accompanied with a board game which are aiming to be used as handy
materials by science communicators and teachers to explain the basic
about the seismology and seismic wave propagation to adolescents. Both
the comics and the board game is released under Creative Commons
license allowing to be freely used for all possible purposes. Materials 
both for home printing as well as for professional printing can be 
downloaded from:
