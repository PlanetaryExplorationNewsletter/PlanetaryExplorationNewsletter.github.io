on teaching the audience key points to communicating science through
successful proposal writing. As a result of this session, participants
will be able to understand the proposal writing, reviewing, and
selection process for federally funded research. How to understand
one's values and maintain those throughout this process will also be
focused on during this workshop.
 
The workshop will be held at:

The 51st Lunar and Planetary Science Conference
Sunday March 15, 2020
The Woodlands Waterway Marriott Hotel and Convention Center
Indian Spring Room

[NASA] ROSES-20 AMENDMENT 3: C.2 EMERGING WORLDS AND C.3 SOLAR SYSTEM
WORKINGS CHANGE IN SCOPE REGARDING LUNAR MATERIALS

Since the inception of SSW and EW there has been a grey area and some
confusion about where to submit some lunar proposals and how to justify
relevance to the program. In response to inquiries by the lunar
community regarding certain lunar proposals, SSW and EW are both being
amended to allow proposals using lunar samples, if they otherwise fall
within scope of the program and successfully make the case for
relevance.

ROSES-2020 Amendment 3 changes the text of both C.2 Emerging Worlds and
C.3 Solar System Workings to indicate that studies of lunar materials
need not be restricted to active, ongoing processes to be in scope of
SSW. For studies of the Moon, sample-based and experimental studies of
the chemical, petrological, and isotopic properties of lunar materials
might be relevant to Solar Systems Workings or Emerging Worlds,
depending on what is proposed. Please refer to Sections 2.2 and 3.1.7
of C.2 Emerging Worlds and Sections 1 and 2.1 of C.3 Solar System
Workings to understand the scopes of these two programs. New text is in
bold and deleted text is struck through. The due dates remain
unchanged. Step-1 proposals for C.2 Emerging Worlds are due April 3,
2020.

POST-DOCTORAL POSITION IN SPACE PHYSICS

Applications are invited for a post-doctoral position studying on the
plasma environment around Venus. The studies are based on data analysis
using observations made by the Venus Express spacecraft.

The ion mass spectrometer on-board measured ions in the energy range 10
eV-36 keV and distinguished between ions with different masses, such a
H+, He2+, He+ and O+/O2+. The focus of the 2 year position is to
investigate the ion velocity distributions and their implications.

Knowledge of the form of the ion velocity distributions functions is
essential to understand microphysical processes such as heating,
acceleration and wave-particle interaction.

[NASA] DUAL-ANONYMOUS PEER REVIEW VIRTUAL TOWN HALL 

On March 3, 2020 at 12:30pm ET, join leadership and division
representatives from NASA's Science Mission Directorate for a virtual
community Town Hall to discuss a pilot study to implement
dual-anonymous peer review for four programs in ROSES-2020. Under this
system, not only are proposers unaware of the identity of reviewers,
but the reviewers do not have explicit knowledge of the proposing teams
and institutions during the scientific evaluation of the proposal.

The four ROSES-2020 programs are:
 
* A.30 Earth Science U.S. Participating Investigator
* B.4 Heliophysics Guest Investigators-Open (Step-1 and Step-2
  proposals will be anonymized)
* D.2 Astrophysics Data Analysis (ADAP)
* E.4 Habitable Worlds (only Step-2 proposals will be anonymized)
 
The Town Hall will: (1) discuss the motivation for switching to
dual-anonymous peer review, (2) describe how to write proposals that
are compatible with dual-anonymous peer review, and (3) explain how
dual-anonymous peer reviews work.

MICROSYMPOSIUM 61 PLANETS UNDERGROUND: NEW DATE/SCHEDULE

Saturday, March 14, 8:30 am - 6:30 pm
 
Planets Underground: The next frontier in planetary exploration
Jack Mustard (Brown) and Vlada Stamenkovic (JPL) co-organizers

The third dimension of planetary bodies remains largely unexplored, yet
is a frontier for expanding our knowledge of planetary evolution and
habitability. Groundbreaking discoveries of the Moon's low crustal
porosity by the GRAIL mission are transformative and have profound
implications for understanding the subsurface habitability of Mars,
Early Earth and other planets. While the surface of Mars, Europa and
Enceladus are widely considered to be uninhabitable, their subsurfaces
are hypothesized to be the long-lived habitable environments. And we
are learning more and more of the vast world of Life Underground on
Earth from the diverse yet largely unexplored biology to the prospects
of billion-year old groundwater.

Microsymposium 61, Planets Underground, poses many exciting science
questions and the technological challenges to acquire measurements
relevant to these questions. The program will be a mix of invited and
contributed papers and will convene on Saturday, March 14, 2030 (8:30
PM-6 PM). The Microsymposium will emphasize an open discussion format,
anchored by invited overviews, contributed talks and posters. Details

[NASA] PDS: RESTORED APOLLO 17 SEP BUNDLE RELEASE

This bundle contains two comma-delimited ASCII files of calibrated
lunar surface electromagnetic field and navigation (range) data from
the Surface Electrical Properties (SEP) Experiment at the Apollo 17
landing site for the time span of 11-13 December 1972. One file
contains straightened science and navigation (range) data; the other
file contains only unstraightened science data. These data were
extracted from binary files held on magnetic tape at the NASA Space
Science Data Coordinated Archive as data set PSPG-00559, then
reformatted to ASCII. This bundle also contains a high-resolution
digital reproduction of the SEP final technical report that contains
plots of the complete set of processed lunar field data, as decibal
values versus range, and explanations the data processing and
calibration techniques implemented by the SEP instrument team.

Data are available here:
