IN MEMORIAM: WILLIAM CASSIDY

Emeritus Professor William A. Cassidy of the Department of Geology and
Environmental Science (formerly the Geology and Planetary Science
Department) at the University of Pittsburgh passed away of a heart
attack on March 22, 2020. Bill is best known for creating the ANSMET
(Antarctic Search for Meteorites) program in 1976, serving as its PI
for nearly 20 years. The ANSMET program has recovered more than 22,000
samples its start, and Bill's efforts helped to triple the world's
inventory of meteorites.

Because of those efforts, the Cassidy Glacier in Antarctica was named
for him, as well as the mineral Cassidyite, and the asteroid 3382
Cassidy. In 1979, he was awarded the Antarctica Service Medal. His
efforts in Antarctica were documented in his memoir, "Meteorites, Ice,
and Antarctica: A Personal Account" published by Cambridge University
Press in 2003.

Bill had a marvelous sense of humor that rivaled his sense of
adventure, which took him to impact craters in Canada, South America,
Africa, and Australia. He will be missed by his colleagues and friends.

[NASA] COVID-19 COMMUNITY UPDATE FROM DR. THOMAS ZURBUCHEN

Last Friday, I hosted a public town hall and wanted to reiterate some
of the key messages from that discussion:

 - Our priority is everyone's safety and protecting hardware and
   integrity of data for operating missions
 - We are working with each mission and project in detail based on
   where they are in the development process
 - Missions in I&T will continue with the smallest teams possible
 - We are anticipating impacts to solicitations and evaluations and
   will work with the research community to mitigate them
 - We encourage all to continue to pay graduate students, post-docs,
   and lab staff

Audio and charts from the town hall are available for download at

https://science.nasa.gov/researchers/virtual-townhall-2020

We will also continue to provide updates to the community.

As we work through this unprecedented situation, please keep yourselves
and your families safe. The government has established a new
informational website, coronavirus.gov, which has useful information,
and watch for continued communications from agency leaders about NASA's
status and steps you may need to take.

Be safe!

Sincerely,
Thomas H. Zurbuchen, PhD
Associate Administrator, NASA Science Mission Directorate

CANCELING THE PLANETARY SCIENCE INFORMATICS AND DATA ANALYTICS
CONFERENCE (PSIDA)

On March 24th 2020, after careful consideration and comprehensive
evaluation of currently available information related to the COVID-19
outbreak, the PSIDA Programme Organizing Committee made the difficult
for safe decision to cancel the Planetary Science Informatics and Data
Analytics Conference, originally scheduled for June 22-24 at ESAC in
Madrid, Spain.

We continue to closely monitor the developments surrounding COVID-19,
and we wish to inform you, that we are planning to take the opportunity
to keep some PSIDA activities later this year using EuroPlanet Science
Congress 2020, that will be held in Granada, Spain, between September
27 and October 2 2020, and possibly at the AGU, if the circumstances 
allow. In agreement with the session conveners, we are thinking of 
using the EPSC 2020 MITM9 session "Tools and Databases for Solar and 
Planetary Sciences at the Big Data Era", to include PSIDA themes.

EPSC SESSION: INTERSTELLAR PROBE - PUSHING THE BOUNDARIES OF SPACE
SCIENCE

An Interstellar Probe through the boundaries of the heliosphere, in to
the Local Interstellar Medium (LISM) would be the first dedicated
mission to venture into this largely unexplored frontier of space.
Relatively modest contributions from the Planetary Sciences and
Astrophysics would offer historic science returns, including a flyby of
one or two Kuiper Belt dwarf planets or planetesimals, first insights
in to the structure of the circum-solar dust disk, and the first
measurements of the Extra-galactic Background Light beyond the
obscuring Zodiacal cloud. This EPSC session welcomes discussions on the
current state of understanding and outstanding science questions that
could be addressed by missions passing through the Kuiper Belt to the
LISM, and reports on realistic design concepts, enabling technologies,
lessons-learned from prior missions, and programmatic challenges.

Conveners: Michel Blanc (main organizer), Olivier Witasse (Deputy
organizer)

Pontus Brandt, Pascale Ehrenfreund, Kathleen Mandt, Merav Opher, Bob

MUAN WORKSHOP2020: UPPER ATMOSPHERES AND IONOSPHERES IN THE INNER SOLAR 
SYSTEM

9-11 September 2020 - New York, USA

The Mars Upper Atmosphere Network (MUAN) organises this three-day
workshop that will bring together scientists interested in the general
dynamics of, and coupling between, ionised and neutral atmospheric
constituents of three key inner Solar System planets: Mars, Earth, and
Venus. Other bodies, such as comets and moons are also welcome. The
objective is to embrace comparative studies between different planetary
bodies in addition to the usual Mars aeronomy and plasma physics
discussions, as this will lead to a better understanding of the role of
upper atmospheres on planetary evolution and habitability at Mars and
in the Solar System.

The main topics to discuss are:
 - Planetary aeronomy - past, present and future. 
 - Thermosphere-ionosphere-magnetosphere-exosphere (TIME) coupling.
 - Lower-upper atmosphere connections.

A significant part of the workshop will be devoted to brainstorming and
opportunities to discuss different science aspects, and to help
establish fruitful collaborations. There will be opportunities to
present posters or talks. The workshop will be limited to 100
attendees, so please indicate your interest to aid us in planning in 
here:
