MERCURY 2020 MEETING CHANGED TO MERCURY 2021 MEETING

Because of the ongoing coronavirus crisis, we have to postpone the 
Mercury 2020 conference that was scheduled for June 2-4, 2020, in 
Orleans, France. This conference will now be held next year, from 
Tuesday June 8, until Friday June 11, 2021, also in Orleans. Note that 
an additional day has been included (4 days in total) to allow for more 
oral presentations.

The conference web site is being updated and shows the new dates:

https://mercury2020.ias.u-psud.fr

A new registration page will also be available at this website as the 
website is updated.

[NASA] ROSES-2019: DELAY OF STEP-2 PROPOSAL DUE DATE FOR C.23
INTERDISCIPLINARY CONSORTIA FOR ASTROBIOLOGY RESEARCH (ICAR)

ROSES-2019 program element C.23 Interdisciplinary Consortia for 
Astrobiology Research (ICAR) solicits proposals that would take an 
interdisciplinary approach to addressing a compelling question in 
astrobiology. Team size and resources requested should be appropriate 
to the scale of the proposed research. There is no ideal size of an 
ICAR Team. Because this is an opportunity for larger teams and for 
five years of support, the scope of the research, and subsequently the 
resources needed, should exceed those typically considered in a 
Research Opportunities in Space and Earth Sciences (ROSES) program 
element.

This amendment delays the Step-2 proposal due date for this 2019 
program element to May 15, 2020. This program uses a two-step proposal 
submission process; only proposers that had previously submitted a 
compliant Step-1 proposal may submit a Step-2 on May 15, 2020. Go to:

http://solicitation.nasaprs.com/ROSES2019 

Questions concerning ICAR may be directed to Mary Voytek at 
Mary.A.Voytek@nasa.gov.

MARS EXPLORATION SCIENCE MONTHLY NEWSLETTER FOR APRIL 2020

On behalf of R. Aileen Yingst (MEPAG Chair), Rich Zurek, Serina 
Diniega, and Dave Beaty of the Mars Program Science Office, the April 
2020 edition of the Mars Exploration Science Monthly Newsletter can be 
found on the web at: 

http://mepag.jpl.nasa.gov 

In this newsletter, we continue to update the upcoming conference 
schedule with postponements, cancellations, and conversions to virtual 
meetings. Additionally, we highlight (1) recently scheduled virtual 
presentations by NASA Science Division to the Space Studies Board on 
March 31, (2) the current draft agenda for the upcoming virtual MEPAG 
Meeting 38 (to be held April 15-17) including presentations on 
community-based white paper topics (April 16), and (3) recent updates 
to the NASEM website for the Decadal Survey on Planetary Science and 
Astrobiology including a new website for white paper submissions 
(due July 4). We hope everyone remains safe and healthy within these 
stressful, rapidly evolving, social-isolating times.

Please send your Mars community announcements and calendar items for 
inclusion in the newsletter to Barbara at:

ESA ANNOUNCEMENT OF OPPORTUNITY FOR MARS 2020 RETURNED SAMPLE SCIENCE 
PARTICIPATING SCIENTISTS

The European Space Agency (ESA) has released an Announcement of 
Opportunity for scientists to serve as Returned Sample Science 
Participating Scientists on the NASA Mars 2020 Science Team. This call 
is open to scientists with relevant expertise who have their main 
affiliation in one of the ESA member states (excluding Canada). 
Proposals for this AO require a letter of intent which must be 
submitted by April 15, 2020. More detailed information can be found in 
the announcement posted at: 

http://www.esa.int/Science_Exploration/Human_and_Robotic_Exploration/Research/Research_Announcements

[NASA] FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS ABOUT GRANTS AND RESEARCH DURING THE 
COVID-19 EPIDEMIC

If you have questions about conducting your research or managing your 
grants during the COVID-19 epidemic, NASA SMD has prepared a Question 
and Answer document.

The document outlines SMD's implementation of recent guidance from the 
Office of Management and the Budget as well as questions regarding the 
processing of existing awards and the donation of Personal Protective 
Equipment purchased using NASA grant funds. 

The document may be downloaded from the SARA library and will be 
updated as conditions change. Go to:

OFFICIAL 2020 MEPAG GOALS DOCUMENT NOW FINALIZED AND AVAILABLE

The MEPAG Goals Committee has completed the 2020 revision of the MEPAG 
Goals Document. The main document and two supplementary tables (a 
hierarchical summary showing all goals, objectives, sub-objectives, and 
investigations plus a table identifying cross-cutting connections 
between investigations under different goals) can be found at: 

https://mepag.jpl.nasa.gov/reports.cfm?expand=science

This has been an extensive revision, following on from a partial 
revision in 2018 and the last full revision in 2015, and incorporating 
many changes to reflect the advances in our understanding of Mars in 
that time. This revision has been the product of not only the 
(volunteer) MEPAG Goals Representatives, but also the community as a 
whole through broad input from the 9th International Mars Conference 
(Summer 2019), community input before re-writing commenced in the Fall 
of 2019, and finally community feedback of a first draft in Winter of 
2020. We hope that releasing this revision at this time can help 
enable its use in Decadal Survey White Papers, and will serve the 
community in general for the next few years before we solicit community 
input again for another revision.

Don Banfield, MEPAG Goals Chair (for the whole MEPAG Goals Committee)

USGS ASTROGEOLOGY COMMUNITY SURVEY STILL OPEN - WE WANT TO HEAR FROM 
YOU

The purpose of this survey is to better understand the ways that our 
community discovers, interacts with, and generates new planetary 
science information. This includes intermediary and derived data as 
well as historical material, photos, technical documents, and other 
resources that cannot be archived in a long-term repository such as 
the PDS. Your responses will help identify areas of future development. 
Results will be summarized and respondents will remain anonymous. 
Results from the survey will be presented at LPSC and/or AGU 2021; 
findings and recommendations will be published as a USGS Open File 
Report. This survey will remain open until the end of May, 
2020:

NASA POSTDOCTORAL FELLOWSHIP - APPLICATION DEADLINE JULY 1, 2020

The NASA Postdoctoral Program offers US and international scientists 
the opportunity to advance their research while contributing to NASA's 
scientific goals. The NPP supports fundamental science, explores the 
undiscovered promotes intellectual growth, and encourages scientific 
connections.

Selected by a competitive peer-review process, NPP Fellows complete 
one- to three-year Fellowship appointments that advance NASA's missions 
in earth science, heliophysics, planetary science, astrophysics, space 
bioscience, aeronautics and engineering, human exploration and space 
operations, and astrobiology.

Current NPP research opportunities in planetary science can be viewed 
here: NPP Planetary Science Research Opportunities

Applicants must have a Ph.D. or equivalent degree in hand before 
beginning the fellowship, but may apply while completing the degree 
requirements. U.S. citizens, Lawful Permanent Residents, and foreign 
nationals eligible for J-1 status as a Research Scholar may apply.

Stipends start at $60,000 per year, with supplements for high 
cost-of-living areas and for certain academic specialties. Financial 
assistance is available for relocation and health insurance, and 
$10,000 per year is provided for professional travel.

2020 NASA PLANETARY SCIENCE SUMMER SCHOOL (PSSS) APPLICATIONS DUE 
APRIL 13, 2020

An informational session on applying to the 2020 PSSS, will be held 
April 7 at 11:00 AM ET. A recording will later be available. 
Registration required: 

https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/SMDS_InfoSession

Applications are due April 13 for NASA's 32nd Annual PSSS, offered by 
the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California. This is a 
3-month early career development experience to learn the development 
of a hypothesis-driven robotic space mission in a concurrent 
engineering environment.

Science and engineering doctoral candidates, recent Ph.D.s, postdocs, 
and junior faculty, who are U.S. Citizens or legal permanent residents 
(and a very limited number of Foreign Nationals from non-designated 
countries) are eligible.

Session 1: May 18-July 24
Session 2: May 18-August 7

Roughly equivalent in workload to a rigorous 3-hour graduate-level 
course, participants spend the first 10 weeks in preparatory webinars 
acting as a science mission team, prior to spending the final 
culminating week at JPL being mentored by JPL's Advance Project Design 
Team, or "Team X" to refine their planetary science mission concept 
design, then present it to a mock expert review board.
