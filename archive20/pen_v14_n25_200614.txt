EPSC2020 SESSION ODAA1: DIVERSITY AND INCLUSIVENESS IN PLANETARY
SCIENCES

The benefits of diversity and inclusiveness in the scientific community
are incontrovertible. This session aims to foster debate within the
planetary sciences community about the reasons behind
under-representation of different groups (gender, cultural, ethnic
origin and national) and best practices to make the research
environment more inclusive identifying and addressing barriers to
equality.

We invite abstracts focusing on: under-representation (gender,
cultural, ethnic origin and nationality biases) supported by statistics
and data; outreach and education activities to reach broad and diverse
audiences, best practices to support inclusiveness; and case studies on
mentoring and bias-concerned activities.

EPSC2020 SESSION SB5: OBSERVING AND MODELLING METEORS IN PLANETARY
ATMOSPHERES

https://meetingorganizer.copernicus.org/EPSC2020/session/38553

Session description: More than 10^7 kg of extraterrestrial objects or
meteoroids ranging in size from a few microns to tens of meters in
diameter enter the Earth's atmosphere every year. A small fraction of
these yields free samples of extraterrestrial matter - meteorites - for
laboratory study. The majority, which burn up or ablate completely in
the Earth's atmosphere, appear as visible meteors in the night sky.
Recording meteor activity and modelling the process of ablation allow
us to measure directly the flux of small planetary impactors. This
provides the 'ground truth' for estimating present cratering rates and
planetary surface ages by implication.

The application of the latest observational and modeling techniques has
rendered meteor science as one of the leading avenues for investigating
the nature and origin of interplanetary matter and its parent bodies.
This session will provide a forum for presenting fundamental results
and novel ideas in this area and informing the broader planetary
science community of the interdisciplinary impact of present and future
work. In particular, it will solicit contributions related to planetary
defense and the impact hazard from meter-sized asteroids.

EPSC2020 SESSION SB11: PHYSICAL PROPERTIES OF SMALL BODIES: 
OBSERVATIONS AND TECHNIQUES
 
Dear Colleague,
 
Please consider submitting an abstract to the EPSC SESSION SB11:
Physical properties of small bodies: observations and techniques
virtual meeting September 21 - October, 2020.

Electromagnetic scattering phenomena play a key role in determining the
properties of Solar System surfaces based on observations using
different techniques and in a variety of wavelengths ranging from the
ultraviolet to the radio. This session will promote a general
advancement in the exploitation of observational and experimental
techniques to characterize radiative transfer in complex particulate
media. Abstracts are solicited on progresses in numerical methods to
extract relevant information from imagery, photometry, polarimetry and
spectroscopy in solid phase, reference laboratory databases,
photometric modeling, interpreting features on planetary surfaces,
mixing/unmixing methods... Software and web service applications are
welcome.

EPSC2020 SESSION OPS3: "PLANET" TITAN 

Please consider submitting an abstract to the EPSC session OPS3:
"Planet" Titan 

This will be a virtual meeting September 21 - October, 2020. 

Despite its satellite status, Titan has nothing to envy to planets: it
has planetary dimensions, a substantial and dynamic atmosphere, a
carbon cycle, a variety of geological features (dunes, lakes, rivers,
mountains...), seasons and a hidden ocean. It even now has its own
mission: Dragonfly, selected by NASA in the frame of the New Frontiers
program.

In this session, scientific presentations are solicited to cover all
aspects of current research on Titan: from its interior to its upper
atmosphere, using data collected in the frame of the Cassini-Huygens
mission (2004-2017) or from ground-based telescopes (e.g., ALMA) or
based on modelling and experimental efforts to support the
interpretation of past and future observations of this unique world.

The NASA DART and the ESA Hera missions will allow performing the first
complete asteroid deflection test by a kinetic impact, including the
full characterization of the target and the impact outcome. The
development of these missions is supported by a large number of
activities in terms of modeling (impact process, dynamics, physical
properties), instrumentation, close proximity operations and data
analyses. In parallel, the inventory and spectral properties of
Near-Earth Objects from Earth and from space (NEOSM) will progress
substantially. This session welcomes contributions related to those
fascinating topics.

Please forward this message to your colleagues and in particular to
any early career researcher you may know who is working on a relevant
topic.

EPSC2020 SESSION SB3: COMETS, CENTAURS, TRANS-NEPTUNIAN AND 
INTERSTELLAR OBJECTS

https://meetingorganizer.copernicus.org/EPSC2020/session/38551

Dates: 21 September 2020 - 9 October 2020

Our knowledge of the physical and dynamical properties of the small
body populations in the Solar System is constantly improving, thanks to
new Earth- and space-based observations, space missions as well as
theoretical advances, and the appearance of the first interstellar
objects. The goal of this session is to highlight recent results that
are providing fundamental clues about the early stages of the solar and
extrasolar systems. Abstracts on topics related to comets, Centaurs,
trans-neptunian and interstellar objects will be welcomed.

WHITE PAPER REGARDING RPIFS AND THE PLANETARY DATA ECOSYSTEM

NASA's Regional Planetary Image Facilities (RPIF) Network has supported
the data analysis needs of the planetary community for over 45 years. 
Over the last decade the Directors of the US RPIF nodes have developed
a plan to evolve the RPIFs into digital data training and support
centers to better enable community members to use spatially-enabled
planetary data, and to better support the evolving Planetary Data
Ecosystem. We have written a White Paper for the Astrobiology and
Planetary Science Decadal Survey that explains this evolution, which
can be downloaded at this link:

BUILDING A NEW GENERATION OF REVIEWERS

Dear colleagues,

As the number of scientific publications grows, the need of reviewers
in science is growing in the same measure. It's time for the younger
generations to build reviewing experience in their CV and thus
flanking/helping the experienced generations to bear an always growing
workload. It's also a wonderful opportunity to have your say and your
contribution to the improvement of submitted papers. It would be great
to hear from new entries who are willing to review papers in the broad
fields of planetary geology and volcanology. Anyone interested please
drop me a line to the following email: giovanni.leone@uda.cl

Best regards,

Prof. Dr. Giovanni Leone
