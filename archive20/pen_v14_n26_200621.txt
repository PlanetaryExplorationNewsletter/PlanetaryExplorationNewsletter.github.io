EDITORIAL: BUILDING A NEW GENERATION OF REVIEWERS - A RESPONSE

Current events, in particular the COVID-19 pandemic and the ongoing
exposure of systematic racism in science and in society at large, have
made the past few months an extremely difficult time for all
scientists, regardless of career stage. We are all experiencing mental,
physical, and emotional fatigue, exacerbated by the fact that we don't
know when things will return to a semblance of "normal". However,
early- and mid-career scientists are often the ones navigating
additional responsibilities related to balancing home and work lives
(e.g., childcare and parent-care, among others) in unprecedented ways,
and often with little or no assistance or guidance.

[NASA] ROSES-20: NEW FRONTIERS DATA ANALYSIS DELAY OF DUE DATES

The objective of C.7 The Planetary Science Division's New Frontiers
Data Analysis Program (NFDAP) is to enhance the scientific return from
New Frontiers missions by broadening scientific participation in the
analysis and interpretation of data returned by these missions. Other
mission and non-mission data sets may be used to supplement these data
in a supporting role, but all proposals must require the use of data
from at least one New Frontiers mission: New Horizons, Juno, and
OSIRIS-REx.

https://pds.nasa.gov/datasearch/subscription-service/SS-20200615.shtml

PDS offers two services for searching the LRO archives:

The Planetary Image Atlas at the Imaging Node allows selection of LRO
data by specific search criteria:

http://pds-imaging.jpl.nasa.gov/search/lro/

The Lunar Orbital Data Explorer at the Geosciences Node allows
searching and downloading of LRO data and other lunar orbital data sets
(Clementine and Lunar Prospector):

INTRODUCING THE TITAN COMMUNITY MAILING LIST (TITAN-L)

Dear Colleagues,

We are excited to bring your attention to a new mailing list that has
been created for researchers interested in Saturn's largest moon. The
Titan Community Mailing List (Titan-L) is a resource for the Titan
community to

- Support communication between members of our community
- Promote integrated research efforts between the diverse areas
  represented
- Obtain/disseminate information
 
Subscribe to the Titan mailing list here:

https://www.lpi.usra.edu/titan-community/

Rules: Titan Community Mailing List intended for the distribution of
Titan-related scientific information and results, including citations
of recently published work, mission details, meeting announcements, and
job postings. The list does not accept attachments (to avoid spreading
viruses and filling people's inboxes). The list is not a forum for
political discussions or opinions about individuals, administrations,
or missions. If a discussion wanders off the subject or away from
objectivity, the Administrators will close the discussion. Thank you
for your understanding.
 
Sincerely,
Vincent Chevrier (list admin), Shannon MacKenzie (list admin), and
Jason Soderblom

OPAG WHITE PAPER INFORMATION

The Outer Planets Assessment Group (OPAG) is soliciting topics for
White Papers to be submitted to the upcoming 2023-2033 Planetary
Science and Astrobiology Decadal Survey. The list of white papers
currently being prepared by members of the OPAG community, and the
status of their preparation are recorded at the following link:

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1as89GEyX50SUrTOOEZBw9dw6bYmmH8vaQFH2nkeRFhU/edit?usp=sharing

Members of OPAG community who are interested in joining any white paper
effort should contact the lead author.

We also encourage the OPAG community to examine the current list of
white papers, and identify any gaps in the topics covered by those
white papers. When any gap is identified, you may initiate an effort to
close those gaps by starting a new white paper, or by contacting OPAG
steering committee members to discuss how to proceed.

New entries to the above spreadsheet can still be made via the
submission form at this link:

https://forms.gle/o4ZxADBUPNZ9jpRp9

To make changes to existing entries, please contact Kunio Sayanagi
<kunio.sayanagi@hamptonu.edu>. In particular, lead authors may be
interested in adding a URL (e.g., Google form) people may follow to
co-sign/endorse their white papers.

VIRTUAL DIDYMOS OBSERVERS WORKSHOP 

June 22-25, 2020

Join observers from the DART, Hera, and LICIACube teams as we discuss
past and upcoming observations of NEA binary Didymos at our virtual
Didymos Observers Workshop. We have an exciting schedule of speakers to
talk about the components of the AIDA collaboration, results from our
past lightcurve observations of Didymos to determine the properties of
the binary system, and future plans for more observations later this
year and after the 2022 DART impact. 

The schedule and (no cost) registration information are posted here:

EPSC SESSION MITM17: POLARIMETRY AS A TOOL FOR CHARACTERIZING DUST
PARTICLES: OBSERVATIONS, MODELING, AND LABORATORY DATA

Remote sensing of Solar System objects such as planetary atmospheres,
comets and asteroids, or the space between them, relies largely on the
analysis of the solar light scattered by dust particles and clouds.
Polarization is an invaluable tool for obtaining information on the
physical properties (size, shape, and composition) and location of the
scattering particles in the corresponding atmosphere. The aim of this
session is to bring together observers, modelers, and experimental
physicists to discuss the most recent results and advances in the
characterization of dust particles by their spectropolarimetric
pattern.  

Conveners: O. Munoz, F. Moreno, A. Penttila, A.C. Levasseur-Regourd, O.

PDS DATA SERVICES AND USER STUDY

The Planetary Data System (PDS) is kicking off a User Study as a
follow-on to the PDS Survey, and next steps towards our Data Services
Initiative. This Initiative and User Study are integral to enhancing
the ways that we can serve you, our planetary science community. More
specifically, we are looking for volunteers to help us get a better
understanding of our how our community currently uses the PDS, but also
how we can improve to meet your future needs. The study will include
individual interviews/discussions (~45-60 minutes), with potential
follow-ups to demo some prototypes. We are looking for folks across all
planetary science domains and experience levels including, but not
limited to: Scientists, tool developers, data providers, educators,
students, international partners, and amateur astronomers.

If you would like to help, please send an email to
pds-operator@jpl.nasa.gov and we will reach out to plan next steps.
Thank you for helping us better understand our community and assistance 
in improving the PDS.

POSTDOCTORAL RESEARCHER IN PLANETARY MAGNETOSPHERIC PHYSICS

Applications are now being accepted for two postdoctoral scientists to
work with the NASA/Goddard Space Flight Center Planetary Magnetospheres
Laboratory in Greenbelt, MD. The position is funded through the CRESST
II.

Position 1: The postdoctoral researcher will work for either the Juno
project with the primary responsibility of conducting analysis and
publishing magnetometer results. In addition, the candidate will
assist with magnetometer data validation and calibration. 

Position 2: The data scientist's primary responsibility will be to 
develop a data production pipeline for future magnetometer missions. 
This involves taking raw magnetometer data, applying the appropriate
transformations and calibrations, and producing the final public data
products. The data scientist is encouraged to pursue their own research
interest.

Candidates for these positions should have Ph.D. in physics, astronomy, 
planetary science, space physics, geosciences, or related fields. 
Successful candidates should also have expertise with one or more 
programming languages commonly used in space science and a demonstrated 
track record in analyzing spaceflight data, especially magnetometer 
data and experience with the NAIF SPICE software package is highly 
desired.

Applications received by July 15, 2020 will receive the best
consideration. Link to full job posting:
