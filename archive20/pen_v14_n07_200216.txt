[NASA] DUAL-ANONYMOUS PEER REVIEW VIRTUAL TOWN HALL

On March 3, 2020 at 12:30pm Eastern Time, join leadership and division
representatives from NASA's Science Mission Directorate for a virtual
community Town Hall to discuss a pilot study to implement
dual-anonymous peer review for four programs in ROSES-2020:

   - A.30 Earth Science U.S. Participating Investigator
   - B.4 Heliophysics Guest Investigators-Open (Step-1 and Step-2 
     proposals will be anonymized)
   - D.2 Astrophysics Data Analysis (ADAP)
   - E.4 Habitable Worlds (only Step-2 proposals will be anonymized)

The Town Hall will: (1) discuss the motivation for switching to
dual-anonymous peer review, (2) describe how to write proposals that
are compatible with dual-anonymous peer review, and (3) explain how
dual-anonymous peer reviews work.

In advance of the SMD Town Hall, questions may be submitted and upvoted
at: 

https://arc.cnf.io/sessions/qg98/#!/dashboard

The Town Hall will broadcast live via WebEx:

MER DATA CATALOG SURVEY

The goal of the Mars Exploration Rovers (MER) Data Catalog Project is
to make it easy and simple for researchers who were not members of the
MER team (as well as the general public) to discover and use Spirit and
Opportunity data. We are conducting a survey to find out what features
potential users would like to see in the catalog. We would appreciate
it if you would take the survey, which should take ~5-10 minutes, by
going to:

http://www.merdatacatalog.com/survey

Please also pass the link on to anyone who might want to use MER data.
We're hoping to hear from Mars-focused and non-Mars-focused planetary
scientists, Earth scientists, high school teachers, undergraduates,
engineers, museum workers, and anyone at all who might be interested in
working with MER data.

Conducting a survey constitutes experimenting on humans, so we have
sought and received approval for the survey from Cornell University's
Institutional Review Board (IRB) Office. The survey does not collect
any identifying information, and all data will be presented in
aggregate. It will be open through April 2020; we will present interim
results collected by February 29th 2020 at LPSC.

POST-DOCTORAL POSITION AT THE CNR IN ITALY

The National Research Council is offering a post-doctoral position at
the Institute of Applied Mathematics and Information Technology in
Milan. The project is entitled "Co-Orbital Motion and Three-Body
Regimes in the Solar System".

The aim is to analyze the co-orbital motion by means of perturbation
methods applied to the third-body effect and, at the same time, by
means of the restricted three-body problem and the corresponding
invariant objects. The focus will be to understand the relationship
between the two approaches and the possible transition towards
different orbital regimes. A special emphasis will be given to apply
the analysis to asteroidal motion.

The project envisages two research periods abroad (about 1 month each):
  - at the University of Thessaloniki under the supervision of Dr. G.
    Voyatzis 
  - at the University of Helsinki under the supervision of Prof.
    M. Granvik.

The candidate is expected to have a Ph.D. in applied mathematics,
planetary sciences or aerospace engineering, with a robust background
in celestial mechanics and numerical simulations.

The duration of the position is 18 months, starting likely in spring
2020.

Those interested can contact Dr. Alessi at em.alessi@mi.imati.cnr.it

SUMMER SCHOOL FOR SOFTWARE SYSTEMS FOR ASTRONOMY - PACKAGE FOR 
INTERNATIONAL STUDENTS

Please note that we have produced a package that allows international
students to more easily attend the summer school in Software Systems
for Astronomy (SSfA-7). The course will take place July 20-31, 2020, 
on the Big Island of Hawaii. The course covers software design and 
implementation of telescope and instrument control systems, 
observation planning tools, and software for analyzing and archiving
astronomical data.

INTRODUCTION TO PLANETARY IMAGE ANALYSIS WITH ARCGIS

The Spacecraft Planetary Imaging Facility (SPIF) of Cornell University
is offering this free workshop at the upcoming 51st LPSC on Sunday,
March 15, sponsored by the Regional Planetary Image Facility (RPIF)
network. This will be an introductory level course accessible to
participants with no prior ArcGIS experience. The workshop will run
from 9:00am to 4:00pm and will cover topics including ArcGIS basics,
spatial analysis, and map document production, mostly through hands-on
exercises using data from Mars Odyssey and Mars Global Surveyor.
Participants will be given a one-year ArcGIS license as part of the
workshop. Space is limited and registration is required:

The deadline for registration is March 6, 2020. Please contact Zoe 
Learner Ponterio, SPIF Manager, for more information at 
zap9@cornell.edu.
