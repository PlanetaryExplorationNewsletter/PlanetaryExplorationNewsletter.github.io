AGU FALL MEETING SESSION: TITAN - PAST, PRESENT AND FUTURE
INVESTIGATIONS OF SATURN'S GIANT MOON

Titan's unique standing as the only moon in the Solar System with a
dense atmosphere provides an environment like no other. Its complex
meteorology of rainfall, wind, rivers, lakes and seas interacting with
a solid surface is reminiscent of the planets of the inner solar
system, while its icy crust and deep liquid water interior provide
comparison to outer Solar System ocean worlds, such as Europa, Ganymede
and Enceladus. Titan alone straddles these diverse environments,
providing a fertile natural laboratory for studying one-of-a-kind
chemistry, dynamics, geology and more. This session welcomes new
results from past missions including Voyager and Cassini-Huygens;
present day modeling, observations and experiments; and on-going
scientific research to prepare for future missions including Dragonfly.

The conveners invite abstracts to be submitted through July 29:

We look forward to a session filled with exciting new results.

AGU FALL MEETING SESSION: CONCEPTS FOR FUTURE PLANETARY SCIENCE
MISSIONS AND INSTRUMENTS (E-LIGHTNING)

Today planetary science missions are exploring the Solar System as
never before. NASA spacecraft are headed to targets from Mercury to the
Kuiper Belt, and aiming to return the first samples from Mars and
asteroid Bennu. ESA spacecraft are reaching new targets from Mercury to
Jupiter, and a wave of other missions from countries around the world
are targeting the Moon, Mars, near-Earth asteroids and beyond, with an
dizzying array of orbiters, rovers and landers. It is an exciting,
dynamic time for planetary scientists with new opportunities to propose
mission concepts ranging from small Cubesats to traditional large
missions. This session solicits interactive electronic poster
(e-Lightning) presentations on novel mission and instrument concepts
designed for future planetary science missions.

Abstract submissions are encouraged on all relevant mission and
instrument concepts by July 29 at: 

https://www.agu.org/Fall-Meeting/2020/Present/Abstracts 

We look forward to another very interesting session in December.

AGU FALL MEETING SESSION: MAGNETOSPHERES IN THE INNER SOLAR SYSTEM

We are pleased to announce the following session and would like to
invite the community to consider submitting an abstract to it for the
upcoming AGU Fall Meeting 2020.

Session description:

The structure and dynamics of each planetary magnetosphere (intrinsic
and induced) in the inner solar system are driven by a unique set of
factors including the nature of its magnetization,
atmosphere-ionosphere coupling, and local solar wind parameters. To
provide a forum for discussion of recent data analysis and modeling
efforts concerning the inner planet magnetospheres, this session
welcomes submissions on the intrinsic magnetospheres of Mercury and
Earth, as well as the induced magnetospheres of Venus and Mars. It will
focus on general magnetospheric processes including, but not limited
to: solar wind-magnetosphere interactions, magnetosphere-ionosphere
coupling, plasma acceleration and transport, magnetic reconnection,
wave instabilities, magnetotail dynamics, and bow shock physics. We
strongly encourage comparative studies of these inner solar system
magnetospheres with each other or with other planetary magnetospheres
throughout the solar system.

CALL FOR PEER REVIEW PANELISTS: NASA MUREP INCLUDES PLANNING GRANT

NASA Research and Education Support Services (NRESS) is seeking persons
willing to serve as peer review panelists for the NASA MUREP INCLUDES
Planning Grant program element listed under Engagement Opportunities in
NASA STEM 2020 (EONS-2020). Information about the opportunity, proposal
requirements and evaluation criteria can be found on the NASA MUREP
INCLUDES Planning Grant page in the NASA Solicitation and Proposal
Integrated Review and Evaluation System (NSPIRES):

The virtual panel will be held July 7-9, 2020 to discuss the submitted
proposals and identify those recommended for funding. Panelist are
expected to be present for the entirety of the panel.

Each proposal is approximately 10 pages in length and every effort will
be made to assign no more than 5 proposals to each panelist.

Non-civil servant panelists will receive a $200/per day honorarium.

[NASA] ROSES-20: XRISM GUEST SCIENTIST PROGRAM DEFERRED TO 2021
 
The objective of the X-Ray Imaging and Spectroscopy Mission (XRISM)
Guest Scientist (XGS) program (D.12 of ROSES-2020) is to enhance the
scientific return during the Performance Verification (PV) phase of
this Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency Mission by opening the
opportunity to participate in the analysis of data collected on
individual targets during the XRISM PV phase to U.S.-based scientists
who are not members of the NASA-appointed instrument team. The
intention was that following the selection of PV-phase targets this
year, this element would be finalized and include a list of the
PV-phase targets, provide a due date for proposals and describe the
process and criteria used in their evaluation. However, since the XRISM
PV phase targets are now expected to be selected and announced during
the 2021 calendar year, NASA will solicit for XRISM Guest Scientists in
ROSES-2021.

[NASA] ROSES-20: RELEASE OF DRAFT TEXT OF CITIZEN SCIENCE SEED FUNDING
PROGRAM FOR COMMUNITY COMMENT
 
The Citizen Science Seed Funding Program (CSSFP) Element of ROSES aims
to support scientists and other experts to develop citizen science
projects relevant to NASA's Astrophysics, Heliophysics and Planetary
Science Research Programs. The CSSFP aims to advance the use of citizen
science by incubating citizen science projects as they are being
conceived or during critical transitions, like the year when they are
first launched or beta tested (i.e., when the first group of volunteers
is invited to try the project) or when the project changes scientific
direction. CSSFP awards require relatively short proposals to encourage
new proposers to experiment with citizen science techniques; the
Science/Technical/Management section has a limit of 6 pages.
 
CSSFP awards have a duration of up to one year only.
 
Draft text for E.9 Citizen Science Seed Funding Program:

[NASA] ROSES-20: FINAL TEXT RELEASED FOR D.16 "ASTROPHYSICS PIONEERS"
SOLICITING ASTROPHYSICS SPACE AND SUBORBITAL SCIENCE INVESTIGATIONS

D.16 "Astrophysics Pioneers" program element of ROSES solicits
proposals for Astrophysics space and sub-orbital science investigations
that are greater in cost, scope and capability than normally possible
within ROSES, e.g., the Astrophysics Research and Analysis (APRA)
program (D.3 of ROSES-2020), but of lesser cost than the Astrophysics
Explorers Mission of Opportunity (MO) program (e.g., PEA O of SALMON-3
for the 2019 opportunity). Investigations using platforms that include
CubeSats (including constellations), SmallSats, Major Balloon Missions,
and International Space Station (ISS)-attached payloads will be
solicited. Technology development and maturation within the proposed
project will be allowed, but the primary review criterion for selection
will be the merit of the proposed science investigation.

Mandatory Notices of Intent are due August 13, 2020 and proposals are
due October 1, 2020. The text has been revised in response to community
comments. Please refer to the bold notice at the top of the program
element for a list of major change and read the text carefully.

POSTDOCTORAL RESEARCHER IN PLANETARY MAGNETOSPHERIC PHYSICS

Applications are now being accepted for two postdoctoral scientists to
work with the NASA/Goddard Space Flight Center Planetary Magnetospheres
Laboratory in Greenbelt, MD. The position is funded through the CRESST
II.

Position 1: The postdoctoral researcher will work for either the Juno
project with the primary responsibility of conducting analysis and
publishing the magnetometer results. In addition, the candidate will
assist with the magnetometer data validation and calibration.

Position 2: The data scientist's primary responsibility will be to
develop a data production pipeline for future magnetometer missions.
This involves taking raw magnetometer data, applying the appropriate
transformations and calibrations, and producing the final public data
products. The data scientist is encouraged to pursue their own research
interest. Candidates for this position should have earned a Ph.D. in
physics, astronomy, planetary science, space physics, geosciences, or
related fields. Successful candidates should also have expertise with
one or more programming languages commonly used in space science and a
demonstrated track record in analyzing spaceflight data, especially
magnetometer data and experience with the NAIF SPICE software package
is highly desired. Applications received by July 15, 2020 will receive
the best consideration. Link to full job posting:
