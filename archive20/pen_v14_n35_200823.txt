[NASA] RFI: INFORMATION ON THE PLANETARY DATA ECOSYSTEM RELEASED

Response Date: November 9, 2020 (NOTE: NASA will start using responses
in September. Please respond as early as possible and consult the RFI
for further details.)

NASA is seeking information and gathering community feedback on the
Planetary Data Ecosystem (PDE) in preparation for the creation of a PDE
Independent Review Board (IRB). NASA defines the PDE "as the ad hoc
connected framework of activities and products that are built upon and
support the data collected by planetary space missions and research
programs, primarily those funded by NASA." The PDE includes but is not
limited to archives, tools, programs, projects, pipelines, and
stakeholder groups. Responses to this RFI will provide community input
on the i) ideal, ii) current, and iii) future state of the PDE.

The full text of the RFI and response instructions can be found at:

https://nspires.nasaprs.com/external/solicitations/summary.do?solId={F0D635B2-C638-402B-862A-9D56320B4826}&path=&method=init

RFI responses must be submitted through NSPIRES.

Address questions and comments to:

Rebecca McCauley Rench, Program Scientist, Planetary Science Division,
Science Mission Directorate, email: becky.mccauley@nasa.gov (subject
line to read "PDE RFI").

[NASA] ARTEMIS SCIENCE WHITE PAPERS DUE SEPTEMBER 8, 2020

The Planetary Science Division is forming a Science Definition Team 
(SDT) that will pull from existing community documents (the LEAG 
Roadmap, Decadal surveys, SCEM report, ASM report) to develop the 
detailed science objectives in the Artemis Science Plan.

To aid the SDT, NASA is soliciting short (maximum 2 pages including
references) white papers on the science to be accomplished with the
Artemis III human crew. The landing site has not yet been selected but
will be within 6 degrees of the South Pole. White papers should focus
on the science objectives to be accomplished and not on instrument or
technology development recommendations.

Supporting documentation for Human Landing Systems (HLS) can be found
here:

NextSTEP Appendix H: Human Landing System:

https://www.nasa.gov/nextstep/humanlander2

White papers must be submitted by 5 pm Central Daylight Time on
September 8, 2020 via:

https://www.hou.usra.edu/meeting_portal/abstract_submission/index.cfm?mtg=664

Technical Note: If you don't already have a user account with USRA's
meeting services, then you will need to create one in order to submit a
White Paper.

ANNOUNCING THE EXOPLANET SOLAR SYSTEM (EXOSS) TUTORIAL TALK SERIES

We would like to invite the planetary science community to join a new
ExoPAG Science Interest Group (SIG3) effort to enhance interactions
between the Exoplanet and Solar System communities. 

https://exoplanets.nasa.gov/exep/exopag/sigs/#sig3

We have established a monthly Tutorial Talk aimed at introducing field
newcomers to important topics or methods in planetary and exoplanetary
science. The talks will include a 30 minute tutorial from an expert to
introduce the topic, followed by a 30 minute group discussion of a
recent paper in which the topic/method features. Each talk will be
recorded and made available online to create a database for community
engagement. Talks will meet the first Thursday of the month at 11 AM
PDT/ 2 PM EDT.

The first ExoSS Tutorial Talk was on August 6th at 11am PDT. The topic
was Volatile Solubilities in Rocks, by Laura Schaefer (Stanford), with
a discussion of Kite et al. (2020) Atmosphere Origins for Exoplanet
Sub-Neptunes.  The recording for this talk can be found here:

LSST SOLAR SYSTEM SCIENCE COLLABORATION

Over its 10 year lifespan, the Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of
Space and Time (LSST) will catalog over 5 million Main Belt asteroids,
almost 300,000 Jupiter Trojans, over 100,000 NEOs, over 40,000 KBOs,
tens of interstellar objects, and over 10,000 comets. Many of these
small bodies will receive hundreds of observations in multiple
bandpasses. The LSST Solar System Science Collaboration (SSSC) is
preparing methods and tools to analyze this data, as well as understand
optimum survey strategies for discovering moving objects throughout the
Solar System. Over the next year, the SSSC will be giving feedback on
the possible scenarios for the LSST survey strategy and providing
suggestions for on-sky observing during Rubin Observatory's
commissioning that would enhance opportunities for science validation.
Our current guidelines on membership are focused on building community
involvement. If you're interested in joining the SSSC, more details can
be found at:

http://www.lsstsssc.org

If you have any questions, please contact the SSSC Co-Chairs, Meg
Schwamb (mschwamb.astro@gmail.com) and David Trilling
(David.Trilling@nau.edu).

INDICATION OF INTEREST: DECADAL WHITE PAPER ON THE VALUE OF EXTENDED
MISSIONS

Please sign up to be involved in a white paper to be submitted to the 
Planetary Science and Astrobiology Decadal Survey on the value of
Extended Missions to planetary science and to the workforce.

https://forms.gle/862Ugz5jdQZfCgBa8

There is a tremendous demonstrated value in Extended Missions. They
produce excellent science at low incremental cost. Additionally, these
missions provide early-career scientists opportunities for active
mission involvement and experience in leadership roles, thus increasing
diversity at all levels. However, despite NASA's best intentions, there
are aspects of their handling of Extended Missions that have
detrimental effects to the success of those missions.

This will be an update to the 2016 National Academies report on
"Extending Science: NASA's Space Science Mission Extensions and the
Senior Review Process". We plan to evaluate the recommendations of that
study, provide a reminder of those recommendations which have not yet
been addressed, and add new recommendations.

Contact Ingrid Daubar (ingrid_daubar@brown.edu) and/or Ross Beyer
(rbeyer@seti.org) with any questions or comments.

POSTDOCTORAL OPPORTUNITIES WITH THE SMA

We are pleased to announce that the applications for the 2021
Submillimeter Array (SMA) Postdoctoral Fellowship program are now open.
We anticipate offering one or more SMA Postdoctoral Fellowships
starting Summer/Fall 2021. Application information and instructions can
be found at:

http://www.cfa.harvard.edu/opportunities/fellowships/sma

The deadline for applications is October 15, 2020. 

The SMA is a pioneering radio interferometer designed for arcsecond
imaging in the submillimeter spectrum.

The SMA is a collaboration between the Smithsonian Astrophysical
Observatory and the Academia Sinica Institute of Astronomy and
Astrophysics in Taipei, Taiwan.

These positions are aimed chiefly at research, both observational and
theoretical, in submillimeter astronomy. Successful candidates will
participate in remote and on-site observations with the SMA, research
in their interpretation, and/or instrument development. Our main
offices at the Center for Astrophysics provide Fellows with unique 
opportunities to develop collaborations within the broader CfA 
community of 250 Ph.D. staff researchers and with extraordinary
freedom in structuring their research activities. Applicants must have
a recent Ph.D. in astronomy or a related field.

Should you have any questions, feel free to contact
smapostdoc@cfa.harvard.edu.

space sciences. The successful candidate will maintain apps for
Microsoft HoloLens, iOS, and Android devices; build new AR experiences
that serve needs of Washington University instructors and scholars; and
coordinate education and outreach.

The candidate selected for this position will also conduct independent
research as an associate of the McDonnell Center for the Space Sciences
(MCSS). In their application, the candidate should describe research
interests and list potential collaborators from among MCSS faculty.

Candidates must have a Ph.D. in Earth, planetary, or space science. The
initial appointment is for one year, renewable for a second year.
Salary is commensurate with experience. To apply, contact Phil
Skemer, Director of the Fossett Lab, with a statement of interest, CV,
and names and contact information for three professional references.
