[NASA] PDS: ODYSSEY DATA RELEASE 70

The Planetary Data System (PDS) is pleased to announce a new delivery
of Odyssey Data, Release 70, for the following instruments:

- GRS 
- THEMIS 
- RADIO SCIENCE (releases 199,200) 
- SPICE

The gamma sensor component of the GRS instrument suite no longer
returns data. The HEND and neutron spectrometer components continue to
operate.

[NASA] PDS: MARS INSIGHT DATA RELEASE 3

The NASA Planetary Data System announces Release 3 of data from the
InSight Lander mission to Mars. This release contains raw and
calibrated data products covering the time period from July 1 through
September 30, 2019. The data are archived at various PDS nodes.

- SEIS (Seismometer) at the Geosciences Node
- RAD (Radiometer) at the Geosciences Node
- RISE (Radio Science) at the Geosciences Node
- TWINS (Temperature and Wind) and Pressure Sensor at the Atmospheres
  Node
- IFG (InSight Fluxgate Magnetometer) at the PPI Node
- ICC/IDC (Instrument Context Camera / Instrument Deployment Camera) at
  the Cartography and Imaging Sciences Node
- IDA (Instrument Deployment Arm) at the Geosciences Node
- SPICE at the NAIF Node

Data from the HP3 (Heat Flow and Physical Properties Probe) will be
included in a future release.

To receive future email announcements for Mars InSight data:

https://pds.nasa.gov/datasearch/subscription-service/top.cfm

The data may be accessed at:

SEIS data are also available through the Incorporated Research
Institutions for Seismology (IRIS) at:

https://www.iris.edu/hq/sis/insight

The next release of InSight data, Release 4, is scheduled for April 1,
2020, and will include both raw and calibrated data. Subsequent
releases will occur every three months.

NSRC-2020 SUBORBITAL RESEARCHERS MEETING ANNOUNCEMENT AND ABSTRACT
DEADLINE

The 2020 Next-Generation Suborbital Researchers Conference (NSRC-
2020) will be held in Colorado, March 2-4. This conference has become
the leading professional forum for researchers and educators interested
in using suborbital rockets and balloons, and features heavy
participation by NASA, flight provider companies like Blue Origin,
World View, and Virgin Galactic. Approximately 300 participants are 
expected. The conference web site and registration information can be 
found at:

http://nsrc.swri.org

NSRC-2020 will take place at the Omni Interlocken Hotel and Resort in
Broomfield, Colorado, with an opening reception Sunday night, March 1
and sessions March 2-4. Abstracts are due January 10 th at:

POSTDOC FELLOWSHIP POSITION IN BEIJING, CHINA

One postdoctoral fellowship position is available in the planetary
science research group at the National Space Science Center in Beijing
China. We seek candidates who are interested in studying the geology,
morphology, and mineralogy of Mars, the Moon, and other planetary
bodies using remote sensing data sets to understand their surface
processes and evolution. The potential research projects include but
not limited to: (1) investigating water-rich paleo-environments and
implications for habitability of Mars; (2) study composition and
physical properties of lunar surface materials and evolution of the
Moon; (3) spectroscopy study of small bodies in the solar system.
Successful candidates will have opportunities to be involved in the
ongoing China's Chang'E 4 mission and China's upcoming Mars 2020 and
Chang'E 5 missions.

This is a two-year postdoc position with possibility to extend to 3
years. The successful candidate will receive up to CNY 250,000
(pre-tax) per year with additional subsidy for apartment renting. The
deadline for this application is March 1, 2020. The starting time is
negotiable. For those who are interested in this position, please send
your CV to Prof. Steve Yang Liu via email: yangliu@nssc.ac.cn

POSTDOC IN MODELING PLASMA ENVIRONMENT OF EXOPLANETS

Applications are invited for a postdoctoral position at the University
of Massachusetts Lowell with Dr. Ofer Cohen. The successful applicant
will develop MHD codes to simulate modulation of stellar radio emission
by transiting exoplanets, star-planet interaction, and will perform
coupled simulations of the plasma environment around short-orbit
exoplanets.

Minimum qualifications for the position include: 
1. Ph.D. in Space Physics, Astrophysics, computational physics or 
   related field. 
2. Model development experience, plasma physics modeling experience, 
   strong background in space plasma physics or astrophysical plasmas.

Other qualifications: 
1. Experience with parallel coding (MPI), Fortran 90 (preferred, but 
   not required). 
2. Good communication and writing skills.

The postdoc will be expected to demonstrate ability to do science work
and submit research proposals independently, and work with
undergraduate/graduate students.  Opportunities to gain teaching
experience may also be available.

To apply, go to:

https://explorejobs.uml.edu/lowell/en-us/job/503644/postdoctoral-
research-associate-modeling-exoplanets-plasmas

or:

https://explorejobs.uml.edu/lowell/en-us/listing/

and search for position number 503644.

Include CV, cover letter, and research summary with application. Names
and contact information of three references will be required during the
application process.
