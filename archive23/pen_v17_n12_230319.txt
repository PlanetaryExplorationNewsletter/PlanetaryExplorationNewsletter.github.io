IN MEMORY OF JACK "DR. ROCK" FARMER (APRIL 18, 1947 - FEBRUARY 22, 
2023)

It is with great sadness that we announce the passing of Jack "Dr. 
Rock" Farmer on February 22, 2023. This is a tremendous loss of a 
widely beloved teacher, mentor, and community outreach leader.

Jack's career spanned nearly 50 years as a paleontologist and an 
astrobiologist, who helped pioneer the field of exopaleontology. 
Throughout his career, Jack played crucial roles in contributing to 
the development of NASA exploration strategies, particularly in the 
search for fossil biosignatures on Mars. He was a kind, patient man 
who left a positive impact in his community.

We offer our heartfelt condolences to his wife, Maria, their daughter, 
Bethany, and the rest of their family. Jack will be deeply missed by 
the many who he inspired. His memory as a compassionate and skilled 
scientist will live on in his students and colleagues.

ASTROBIOLOGY SCICOMM GUILD MARCH MEETING: DIGITAL LEARNING PROJECTS 
FOR SCIENTISTS, EDUCATORS, AND STUDENTS 

The Astrobiology SciComm Guild is an initiative of the NASA 
Astrobiology Program office. Our mission is to support the 
astrobiology community as evolving science communicators, by 
leveraging and co-creating SciComm opportunities for members while 
serving DEIA ideals. We regularly bring members diverse SciComm 
opportunities with NASA and external partners. Our next virtual 
meeting will be on March 23 at 10 am Pacific / 1 pm Eastern where 
we'll have guest speakers from NASA's Infiniscope team, of NASA's 
Science Activation program, to discuss digital learning opportunities 
for members. If you would like to become a member, please contact 
svetlana.shkolyar@nasa.gov. To attend the March meeting, register and

[NASA] REQUEST FOR INFORMATION: NEW HORIZONS INTERSTELLAR MISSION

Number: NNH23ZDA011L

Release Date: March 15, 2023

Response Date: April 17, 2023

The Heliophysics Division (HPD), Astrophysics Division (APD), and 
Planetary Science Division (PSD) of NASA's Science Mission Directorate 
(SMD) are soliciting information under this Request for Information 
(RFI) to determine interest in the science community for continuing 
the New Horizons mission operations and utilizing its unique position 
in the Solar System to answer important questions about the 
heliosphere and its interaction with the interstellar medium while 
allowing for scientific opportunities that present themselves beyond 
Heliophysics. The RFI is focused on determining whether interested 
science teams have a set of science objectives to propose to NASA for 
use of the mission beyond FY24. The purpose of this RFI is to gauge 
the level of interest of the wider science community in pursuing the 
next phase of science leadership for the mission and to estimate 
appropriate annual costs.

The RFI seeks responses only from United States persons, i.e., U.S. 
industry, universities, non-profit organizations, NASA Centers, other 
U.S. Government agencies, and individual researchers. International 
team members, i.e., entities or individuals outside the U.S., are 
permitted as part RFI responses from U.S.-led science teams.

[NASA] ROSES-23 AMENDMENT 5: F.15 HIGH PRIORITY OPEN-SOURCE SCIENCE 
FINAL TEXT AND DUE DATES

Program element F.15 High Priority Open-Source Science (HPOSS) 
supports the development of innovative open-source tools, software, 
frameworks, data formats, and libraries that will have a significant 
positive impact to the SMD science community.

ROSES-2023 Amendment 5 releases the final text for this program 
element, which had been listed as "TBD". This is a no-due-date program 
and proposals may be submitted at any time until March 29, 2024, by 
which point the ROSES-2024 version of this program element should be 
open for proposal submission.

This program will evaluate proposals using dual-anonymous peer review, 
see Section 4.3 and the associated "Guidelines for Anonymous 
Proposals" document under "Other Documents" on the NSPIRES page for 
this program element

https://solicitation.nasaprs.com/ROSES2023

Questions concerning F.15 HPOSS may be directed to Chelle Gentemann 
at chelle.gentemann@nasa.gov and Rachel Paseka at 
rachel.e.paseka@nasa.gov.

[NASA] PANEL REVIEWERS NEEDED FOR MUREP WOMEN'S COLLEGES AND 
UNIVERSITIES

Minority University Research and Education Project (MUREP) Women's 
Colleges and Universities (WCU) is a new initiative seeking to address 
the significant gender gap and disparate experiences of women in STEM 
in the United States. WCU awardees will research and develop 
strategies through an intersectional lens to increase retention of 
women in STEM degrees and workforce.
 
NRESS is seeking panel reviewers for a virtual panel review scheduled 
for April 26-28, 2023.

The panel will be comprised of a group of peers, discussing the 
strengths and weaknesses of each proposal. The duration of the panel 
might change depending on the number of proposals being reviewed, but 
for scheduling purposes, plan on a full-day commitment for all three 
days. Non-civil servant panelists may be eligible to receive a 
$200/per day honorarium.
 
If you are interested in serving as a virtual panelist, please 
register by March 31, 2023.

Please note, your willingness to participate in this review does not 
guarantee your selection. Reviewers will be selected based on the 
subject matter of each proposal received. You will only be contacted 
if you are selected to participate.
