[NASA] SMD: ROSES-2023 UPDATES REGARDING OPEN SCIENCE AND DATA 
MANAGEMENT PLAN TO SUMMARY OF SOLICITATION AND RESEARCH OVERVIEWS

On or about May 15, 2023, Section II(c) of the ROSES-2023 Summary of 
Solicitation and the six research overviews (A.1, B.1) have been 
updated in two ways regarding the "Open Science and Data Management 
Plan" (OSDMP):

1) to include a link to the new SMD Open-Source Science Guidance 
   document (https://science.nasa.gov/oss-guidance) to help proposers 
   write their plans and

2) An important clarification regarding software archiving: The method 
   of archiving software will not result in a weakness for proposals 
   to ROSES-2023.

Where appropriate, in both the ROSES-2023 Summary of Solicitation and 
the six research overviews other small updates were also made, such as 
to the list of program elements and the references to the "Proposer's 
Guide" (formerly the Guidebook for Proposers). New text is in bold.

Direct general questions concerning the ROSES-2023 Summary of 
Solicitation to Max Bernstein at SARA@nasa.gov, general questions 
concerning the OSDMP to HQ-SMD-SPD41@mail.nasa.gov, questions 
regarding the division overviews to the R&A leads, and questions about 
particular program elements to their respective point(s) of contact, 
all of whom may be found at:

SMALL BODIES ASSESSMENT GROUP STEERING COMMITTEE POSITION

The Small Bodies Assessment Group (SBAG) has extended the application 
period for its open Human Exploration Lead Steering Committee (SC) 
position (3-yr term) due to low response rate. The SC organizes SBAG 
meetings, writes official findings, and takes a leadership role in 
activities where community input is needed.

The Human Exploration Lead is an individual actively involved in 
studying human exploration (or adjacent tasks in support of that 
endeavor), aware of current challenges and advances in the field, to 
lead SBAG activities relevant to human exploration. Under their 
guidance, SBAG will continue advancing our knowledge of potential 
small body destinations and their environments for human exploration.

The application requires: 1) a two-page CV, including a description of 
participation in SBAG or other small bodies organizations, 2) a short 
(300 words maximum) statement of interest. Selection criteria
include participation in small bodies community organizations, 
leadership experience, and relevant research/mission experience.

In support of diversity, applicants may specify gender, whether they 
belong to an underrepresented group in STEM, or other relevant
information.

E-mail applications to Lori Feaga (feaga@astro.umd.edu) by May 31, 
8:00 PM EDT. New members will be announced at the 29th Meeting of SBAG.
