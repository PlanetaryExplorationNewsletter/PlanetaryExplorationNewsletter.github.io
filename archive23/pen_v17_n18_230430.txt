REGISTRATION OPEN FOR 2023 HYBRID PLANETINSITU WORKSHOP, WITHIN THE 
BRINES CONFERENCE
 
Folks are invited to participate in the first 2023 hybrid workshop on
Optimizing Planetary In Situ Surface-Atmosphere Interaction
Investigations (PlanetInsitu), held in conjunction with the Ancient &
Future Brines Conference.
 
This one-day workshop, held virtually and in Reno, NV on Thursday, May
18 (within the Brines conference) will include lightning talks about
instrument and operations concepts under-development, panel discussions
about observation site selection considerations and avoiding
spacecraft-induced perturbations. Folks registered with the Brines
conference do not need to separately register for this workshop.
 
Other community members interested in participating in the Thursday
presentations/discussion can register (for free) at:
 
https://tinyurl.com/yubxeh54
 
As we can accommodate a limited number of virtual attendees, those that
would observe only should wait for recordings of the workshop to be
posted on the PlanetInsitu website:
 
https://planetinsitu.space/planet-in-situ-at-brines/
 
The Brines conference website is at:
 
https://www.hou.usra.edu/meetings/ancientfuturebrines2023/
 
If you are interested in attending in-person and able to demonstrate
a relevant technology during the Brines fieldtrip on Friday, May 19,
please indicate this on the registration and note the travel grants
available for U.S. persons, with deadline May 3.

[NASA] ROSES-23 AMENDMENT 18: C.25 HERA PARTICIPATING SCIENTIST 
PROGRAM TBD PLACEHOLDER

The Hera mission is Europe's contribution to the international 
planetary defense demonstration that was initiated by NASA's Double 
Asteroid Redirection Test (DART). Hera is planned to launch in 2024 
and arrive at the Didymos system in 2026 to perform a close-up survey 
of both asteroids, measuring their masses and compositions, and 
assessing the changes caused by DART. If solicited, C.25 Hera 
Participating Scientist Program (PSP) will be the sole vehicle by 
which NASA will support U.S. scientists participating on the Hera 
Investigation Team as international members.

ROSES-2023 Amendment 18 adds a TBD placeholder for the new program 
element C.25 Hera Participating Scientist Program (PSP). If proposals 
are solicited, it is anticipated that the final text for this program 
element will be released no fewer than 90 days prior to the proposal 
due date.

Questions concerning C.25 Hera PSP may be directed to Thomas Statler 
at thomas.s.statler@nasa.gov.

[NASA] ROSES-23 AMENDMENT 19: B.5 LIVING WITH A STAR SCIENCE FINAL 
TEXT AND DUE DATES

The goal B.5 Living with a Star Science (LWS) is to provide advances 
in scientific understanding of the coupled Sun-Earth system that can 
lead to predictive capability of the space environment conditions at 
Earth, other planetary systems, and in the interplanetary medium. 
Every year the LWS Science program element solicits Focused Science 
Topics that address some part of this goal.

This year the Focused Science Topics are:
1. Understanding Ionospheric Conductivity and its Variability;
2. Synergistic View of the Global Magnetosphere; and
3. Evolution of Coronal Mass Ejections in the Corona and Inner 
   Heliosphere

ROSES-2023 Amendment 19 releases final text and due dates for B.5 LWS. 
Step-1 proposals are due by August 15, 2023, and Step-2 proposals are 
due November 7, 2023.

Go to:

https://solicitation.nasaprs.com/ROSES2023

Questions concerning B.5 LWS may be directed to John McCormack at

REQUEST FOR FEEDBACK ON MARS SAMPLE DEPOT WORKSHOP

The Planetary Science Advisory Committee (PAC) has, at several times, 
expressed concerns about the level and nature of planetary community 
involvement as NASA makes programmatic decisions. A recent example of 
an interaction between NASA and the community regarding a major NASA 
decision was the Mars 2020/MSR Sample Depot Science Community Workshop 
held September 28 & 30, 2022. Although this was not a MEPAG-sponsored 
meeting, the PAC has invited MEPAG to comment on the quality of the 
interaction between NASA and the planetary science community and 
whether there are lessons learned (good or bad) for similar 
interactions in the future; another question is whether the approach 
taken at that meeting could be used as an example for other community 
engagement activities. If you attended the Sample Depot Workshop, it 
would be very helpful to the planetary science community if you would 
fill out the survey at the link below. All answers will remain 
anonymous. Please note that we are not inquiring about the merits of 
the workshop itself or the decisions made there.

The deadline for responding is May 12, 2023.
