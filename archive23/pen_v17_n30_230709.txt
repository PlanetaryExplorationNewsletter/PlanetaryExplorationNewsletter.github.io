LIFE

Dear planetary and astrobiology colleagues,

We welcome you to the 18th year of this session on Saturn's moon
Enceladus! We seek contributions spanning a range of topics fundamental
to how Enceladus works and whether it might host life. Topics of
interest include (but are not limited to) Enceladus's origin and
orbital evolution, plume physics and subsurface plumbing, surface
geology, chemistry, and ice tectonics, interior structure, subsurface
ocean composition and dynamics, hydrothermal activity, organic
evolution and the possible emergence of life, habitability through
time, and biosignature potential. We will foster a collegial
atmosphere and promote diverse perspectives. We encourage the
participation of planetary scientists, astrobiologists, astronomers,
microbiologists, geologists, geophysicists, geochemists,
volcanologists, and oceanographers. Results from analogue field work,
Cassini and telescopic data analyses, modeling studies, laboratory
experiments, and mission/instrument development are welcome, as are
comparisons with other ocean worlds.

This session will showcase the vibrancy of our community to cap off
another year of exciting advancements.

Please submit here:

AGU SESSION P020: GIANT PLANET INTERIORS

Our understanding of planet formation and evolution depends on setting
new constraints to the present-day interior structure and dynamics of
the giant planets. New measurements from the Juno and Cassini missions
have recently revealed novel fundamental aspects of the interiors of
Jupiter and Saturn. The recently prioritized Uranus Orbiter and Probe
flagship-class mission motivates new studies of Uranus to set the stage
for the acquisition and retrieval of a wealth of new data. Here we will
bring together theory and observations capable of advancing our
understanding of giant planet interiors within the Solar System and
beyond. We welcome submissions within a broad range of topics,
including: ring and Doppler seismology, gravity fields, normal mode
oscillations, zonal flows and differential rotation, dynamo magnetic
fields, core detection and characterization, stable stratification,
helium and heavy element bulk composition, formation scenarios, and
evolutionary pathways.

We welcome submissions until the abstract deadline August 2, 2023:

PHD STUDENT IN SPACE PHYSICS FOR STUDIES OF SPACE WEATHER

The Swedish Institute of Space Physics (IRF) is seeking a highly
motivated individual to join a space-weather research project to
investigate geomagnetically induced currents (GICs) in the Swedish
power grid. The project is part of an ongoing collaboration between
IRF, the Swedish Research Defence Agency, the Swedish Civil
Contingencies Agency, and Svenska Kraftnat to improve awareness and
resilience to space weather effects in Sweden.

GICs are unwanted currents that flow in ground-based infrastructure
caused by varying conditions in space, often due to plasma eruptions
from the Sun. They can cause physical damage and lead to disruptions
such as blackouts, and thus, it is of high societal importance to
mitigate this hazard. One of the outstanding questions is identifying
the transmission lines at risk to GICs in Sweden.

The PhD project will focus on evaluating and understanding the causes
of GICs in Sweden using state-of-the-art ground- and space-based
experimental data, advanced plasma simulations, as well as 3D ground
conductivity modelling.

The position is available at the Uppsala office at IRF, located at
the Angstrom Laboratory.

Applications sent by email to: registrator@irf.se

Closing date for applications: 21 August 2023

PLANETARY PHOTOGRAMMETRY WORKSHOP ANNOUNCEMENT

As part of the Planetary Data Training Program, the University of
Arizona Space Imagery Center will hold a planetary photogrammetry
workshop on September 12-15, 2023.
 
In this workshop we introduce the basic principles of photogrammetry
and the skills necessary to make a Digital Terrain Model from stereo
image pairs. Participants will go through the process of creating a
DTM and orthorectified images with a HiRISE stereo pair using BAE's
SOCET SET software and 3D hardware. We will also cover the use of Ames
Stereo Pipeline and Structure-from-Motion (SfM) using Agisoft
Metashape. The workshop is intended for researchers at any level who
want to learn to generate their own stereo products. No prior expertise
is required.

Due to the specialized hardware required, attendance is in-person
only and is limited to 10 people. There is no fee to attend, but
participants are responsible for their own travel expenses. Thanks to
support from NASA's Topical Workshops, Symposia, and Conferences (TWSC)
program, we offer two travel grants of up to $2000 each that focus on
new planetary students from underrepresented communities (applications
are due August 12th).
