IN MEMORY OF LEN TYLER (OCTOBER 18, 1940 - MARCH 16, 2023)

G. Leonard (Len) Tyler - gifted colleague, mentor, and friend - passed
away in Port Townsend, WA, at the age of 82. The cause was late stage
Alzheimer's disease.

Len was trained as an electrical engineer. His career was based on
application of signal processing and related skills to remote sensing
of planets. As a leader in the specialized field of radio science, he
explored each of the main bodies in the Solar System, the last being
Pluto as Principal Investigator during development of the Radio Science
Experiment (REX) on New Horizons. During his career he also
investigated radiowave scattering from Earthâ€™s ocean surfaces and was a
PI or Co-I on the Viking, Voyager, Magellan, Mars Global Express, and
Mars Express missions.

A memorial is planned on June 5, 2023 at Stanford University, where Len
was a Professor in the Electrical Engineering Department. For more
information on the memorial, contact Ivan Linscott at
linscott@stanford.edu.

NEAR-EARTH OBJECT WORKSHOP TO ASSESS RECONNAISSANCE FOR PLANETARY
DEFENSE (NEO WARP) 2
 
The Near-Earth Object Workshops to Assess Reconnaissance for Planetary
defense (NEO WARP) series focuses on the U.S. National NEO Plan actions
aimed at technology development for NEO reconnaissance missions,
including rapid-response options. The second workshop in the series,
NEO WARP 2, will focus on the theme: "identify technology gaps and
potential concepts for NEO flyby reconnaissance performance." 

NEO WARP 2 will take place at the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics
Laboratory in Laurel, Maryland, on June 28-30, 2023. The meeting will
run 2.5 days, ending around noon on June 30. Registration will be free
but required for participation. Full group discussions will be hybrid;
breakout sessions will be either in-person or virtual (NOT hybrid for
breakout sessions).

AAE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SPACE EXPLORATION

The International Conference on Space Exploration, organised by the Air
and Space Academy (AAE) with the support of AIDAA, PoliTo and SGAC,
will occur on 10-12 May 2023, in Turin, Italy.

This conference will focus on themes underpinning Space Exploration,
with the aim of providing useful input to agencies or other bodies in
charge of building programmes. Keynote speeches by leading
personalities will address the purposes and policies behind space
exploration and provide an overview of the current state of play. 

Seven sessions will examine aspects fundamental for most exploration
projects:

1. Philosophy and cultural motivations
2. Dream missions
3. Towards an environment-friendly approach to Lunar exploration
4. Flying machines
5. Going faster (and further)
6. Water: our quest for "oases" in the Solar System
7. Human-robots collaboration

A number of Q&A sessions, together with a wrap-up moderated by SGAC,
will aim to give the floor to the audience. Other highlights include a
contradictory debate on "Life in the universe: rule or exception?" An
ice-breaking cocktail will end the first day and a visit to Thales
Alenia Space is planned for the end of the second day.

NAIF RELEASES NEW WEBGEOCALC VERSION 2.6.1

NAIF announces the deployment of the new WebGeocalc (WGC) version 2.6.1
on both NAIF's WGC servers:

https://wgc.jpl.nasa.gov:8443/ (GUI only)
https://wgc2.jpl.nasa.gov:8443/ (GUI and Web API)

This new version adds a new Tangent Point calculation and support for
Azimuth/Elevation/Range (AZ/EL/R) coordinates both in WGC GUI and in
the WGC Web API.

The Tangent Point calculation computes the point on the ray nearest to
the target's surface modeled as an ellipsoid, the point on the target's
surface nearest to the tangent point, and a few additional parameters
such as illumination angles (incidence, emission and phase), time and
local true solar time at one of these points. The locations of both
points are optionally corrected for light time and stellar aberration,
and may be represented using either Rectangular, Ra/Dec,
Planetocentric, Planetodetic, Planetographic, Spherical or Cylindrical
coordinates.

The support for the Azimuth/Elevation/Range coordinates has been added
to various WGC calculations.

For more information about WGC, including tutorials and usage examples,
please see: 

https://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/naif/webgeocalc.html.

PHD POSITION AT THE UNIVERSITY OF BERN

The Space Research and Planetology Division at the University of Bern
(WP) is seeking a PhD student to join its Space Science Group. The goal
of the proposed PhD project is to improve our group's atmosphere model
by refining the description of the atmospheric contributions by solar
wind ions and micro-meteorites. These model improvements are targeted
at Mercury and the Moon, but can also be used to study atmospheres of
other rocky objects within our Solar System, e.g., asteroids or mineral
patches found on icy moons. A first use-case of the refined model will
be the simulation of the mineral content in Mercury's atmosphere in
preparation for the upcoming BepiColombo measurements. The PhD student
will also be involved in the analysis and interpretation of data
obtained by BepiColomo, once available, including comparing the
measurement data with the obtained model results.

COMMENT 

ROSES-2023 Amendment 15 releases a DRAFT of F.12 Artemis III Deployed
Instruments for community comment. Comments are due by May 17, 2023.

A3DI will solicit both standalone instruments and instrument suites to
conduct science investigations that can be uniquely accomplished by
human deployment of payloads on the surface of the Moon during Artemis
III. Deployed instruments consist of autonomous instrument packages
installed on the lunar surface by astronauts during extravehicular
activities. Proposed deployed instruments must address one or more of
the scientific objectives outlined in the Artemis III Science
Definition Team (SDT) Report.

Proposals must include:
 
- Expected science results
- Instrument concept of operations, including why crew are needed for
  deployment, how the instrument is to be deployed, any special
  requirements for deployment, an estimate of the crew time needed for
  deployment, and an overview of the real-time ground-based science
  support needed to deploy the instrument during EVA
- Resource requirements for the proposed investigation including cost,
  mass, volume, power, telemetry, data transfer need, astronaut
  interaction, etc.
- Demonstration of adherence to basic safety requirements and human
  factors design.
