PHD POSITION AT GERMAN AEROSPACE CENTER IN BERLIN

At the Institute of Optical Sensor Systems in Berlin, Germany, which is
part of the German Aerospace Center, we are looking for a PhD student
to investigate the use of machine learning for the analysis of in-situ
spectroscopic planetary data. A main objective of the position will be
to combine scientific knowledge about spectroscopy with data-driven
methods, also known as scientific machine learning. The announcement is
available at:

AGU SESSION P017: FORWARD TO THE MOON - LUNAR EXPLORATION SCIENCE

A new era of human and robotic lunar exploration is opening new vistas
and scientific understanding as humanity reaches toward the Moon again.
In partnership with institutions around the globe, NASA's Solar System
Exploration Research Virtual Institute (SSERVI) focuses on these
scientific aspects of exploration as they relate to the Moon and other
airless bodies. This session will feature interdisciplinary,
exploration-related science centered around the Moon as a human and
robotic destination. Presentations in this session will focus on the
theme of science that enables exploration and exploration that enables
science. We will examine key scientific investigations that will
facilitate future lunar exploration, as well as investigations of the
Moon and beyond that will be uniquely enabled by being done from the
Moon.  

We look forward to receiving your abstracts. Graduate students and
early career researchers are particularly encouraged to submit for
oral presentations.

AGU SESSION P025: MARTIAN AQUEOUS PROCESSES INFERRED FROM OBSERVATIONS,
ANALOGS, AND EXPERIMENTS

Aqueous alteration has been prevalent on the surface of Mars, as
evidenced by interesting disequilibrium diagenetic assemblages at
Jezero Crater, Gale Crater, Meridiani Planum, and in martian
meteorites. Large chloride and sulfate deposits have also been
detected from orbit that could indicate an evaporative period on Mars.
In addition, the potential for deep liquid aquifers on modern Mars is
inferred based on the study of water mobile species. These discoveries
have important habitability implications for Mars and provide an
improved insight into Mars' aqueous history. In this session, we
invite contributions describing advances in experimental studies,
geochemical models, and field studies of aqueous alteration with
groundwater brines or surface weathering relevant to Mars.

AGU SESSION P038: SMALL SOLAR SYSTEM BODIES - SAMPLE RETURNS, JWST,
GROUND-BASED ASTRONOMY AND MORE

Observations returned by space missions (e.g., OSIRIS-REx, Hayabusa 2,
New Horizons) and large telescopic facilities (e.g., JWST, Adaptive
optics observations) offer a broad encompassing view of the populations
of large planetesimals and dwarf planets that formed shortly after
Solar System formation. Most of these bodies have retained information
on their accretional environments while others have undergone
significant internal evolution.

The sample return missions will continue deciphering the Solar System's
early history with the exploration of near Earth asteroids like Ryugu
and Bennu. Upcoming flyby missions to visit 16 Psyche and Jupiter
Trojan asteroids and instruments on the extremely large telescopes
available in the next decade will provide observations with
unprecedented details of many large planetesimals.

This session welcomes abstracts that address analyses of returned
samples, new observations and models of large planetesimals found
across the Solar System, and contrast the properties of planetesimals
found in various small body reservoirs.

AGU SESSION P042: ULTRAVIOLET OBSERVING OF SOLAR SYSTEM TARGETS

Ultraviolet spectroscopy and imaging have a decades-long history as
valuable techniques for studying atmospheres, aurorae, plumes and
surface composition and volatiles on asteroids, comet nuclei and moons.
While there continue to be opportunities for UV remote sensing from
Earth orbit and in future robotic missions, the infrastructure for UV
instrumentation is at a crossroads. Existing orbital facilities are
nearing the end of their useful lives and there continue to be many
phenomena that cannot be effectively studied with existing,
high-heritage instrument designs. Exciting advances in UV-optimized
technologies promise new capabilities that can be incorporated into
the next generation of robotic probes, flexible SmallSat missions,
and large aperture space-based observatories. This session welcomes
abstracts covering UV science results, as well as reports on progress
toward developing new technologies such as UV detectors, high
performance coatings and novel sensor designs. We welcome submissions
from early career scientists and new members of the discipline. To
submit an abstract to this session, please go to:

https://agu.confex.com/agu/fm23/prelim.cgi/Session/192562

Abstracts are due by August 2.

This summer school vill focus on which role volcanism, plate tectonics
and hydrothermal vents played in the emergence and evolution of life.
It will give lecturers of leading scientists on this subject. Moreover,
there will be sampling excursions to lava caves and solfatares as well
as exercises on genetic characterisation of extremophiles population
those habitats as well as on cultivation of bacteria. Angra is a
picturesque city and has plenty of good restaurants and clean and
affordable hotels with good services. There are flights to the close

COMMERCIAL SPACE EXPLORATION AND TRAVEL - CHANCES AND RISKS

25-27 September 2023
Kiruna, Sweden

The meeting "Commercial Space Exploration and Travel - Chances and
Risks" will bring scientists, students, politicians, journalists and
other stakeholders together to discuss the ethical, political legal,
societal and environmental aspects of commercial space travel.

It will take place at Malmfalten Adult Education Centre in Kiruna,
Sweden in from 25 September in the morning to 27 September in the
evening. Apart from offering a very interesting programme, the meeting
will take place during Lapland's very beautiful Indian Summer, which
enables good opportunities to see the Northern Lights.

The meeting will cover the following subjects:

- Legal, ethical and societal issues concerning commercial space
  exploration
- Environmental issues concerning space exploration
- Protection of extraterrestrial bodies
- Spin-offs of scientific space exploration
- International cooperation in commercial use of space: will space
  exploration be restricted to a few powerful countries and regions?
- Space research and exploration as a chance for remote regions in
  Europe
- Global governance efforts regarding the commercial use of space
- Mining of extraterrestrial bodies
- The future of commercial space travel

We are looking to engage ~40 individuals in academic STEMM who have
caregiving responsibilities outside of work, particularly scientists
and professionals of color; those who identify as LGBTQ+, first-gen,
or immigrant; those living with disabilities; and those in heavily
male-dominated fields (such as physics; computer science; astronomy
and astrophysics; and civil, aerospace, electrical, and mechanical
engineering). Those selected will be invited to participate in a 1-hour
Zoom interview and receive a $75 gift card as a token of thanks.

If you meet these criteria and are interested in being considered for
the study, please complete a brief screening form at:

https://survey.rti.org/se/1/care  

Feel free to forward this notice to anyone you think might meet the
criteria and would be interested.
