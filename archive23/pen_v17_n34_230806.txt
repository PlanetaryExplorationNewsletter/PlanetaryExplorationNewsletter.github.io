record as a researcher, educator and mentor, and an accomplished record
of effective leadership. In addition, they should possess a strong
commitment to staff and faculty development; student success;
institutional advancement/development and public engagement. We
strongly encourage applications from women, underrepresented
minorities, individuals with disabilities, and veterans. Georgia Tech
has policies to promote a healthy work-life balance and is aware that
attracting faculty may require meeting the needs of two careers.

For further details regarding the application process, please visit:

https://www.eas.gatech.edu/chair-search

MENTOR MATCHING PROGRAM AT DPS-EPSC 2023

The Europlanet Early Career Group is hosting a Mentor Matching Program
at the joint Division for Planetary Sciences/Europlanet Science
Congress (DPS-EPSC) meeting this year. It is open to anyone attending
the meeting virtually or in-person. Here is the website for more
details and also the sign up links for both mentors and mentees. We
hope those attending the conference can take advantage of this
opportunity to share advice!

THE TRANS-NEPTUNIAN SOLAR SYSTEM 2024 MEETING

We are pleased to announce an international conference on the
Trans-Neptunian Solar System to be held in Taipei, Taiwan 24 - 28 June,
2024. This conference will be the next in a series of meetings that was
last held in Coimbra, Portugal in March 2018. The event will be held at
the Academia Sinica Institute of Astronomy and Astrophysics, which is
located on the campus of National Taiwan University in Taipei. The
program will include both oral and poster sessions and will focus a
number of topics, including:

- Physical and dynamical properties
- Dwarf planets
- Binaries and multiple systems
- Relationships with other small body populations (Centaurs, Trojans,
  comets, inner Oort Cloud objects, interstellar objects)
- Distant Trans-Neptunian Objects
- Formation and evolutionary processes
- Current and future surveys
- Laboratory studies
- Current and future space missions
- Occultations

The conference website can be found here:

https://www.tno2024.org

Registration and abstract submission will open later this summer. Stay
tuned for further announcements.

WORKSHOP ANNOUNCEMENT: HABITABILITY - THE ASTROPHYSICAL, ATMOSPHERIC,
AND GEOPHYSICAL IMPLICATIONS

May 21 - June 14, 2024.
MIAPbP, Garching, Germany

It is our pleasure to announce the 2024 Planetary Habitability program
at the Munich Institute for Astro-, Particle, and Bio-Physics (MIAPbP).
This workshop brings together scientists from all areas of habitability
including stellar astrophysics, planetary science, planetary dynamics,
atmospheric science, geology, and geophysics to discuss fundamental
questions regarding the formation, characterization, and detection of
habitable planets.

The structure of the program is informal. The main goal is to create an
environment that facilitates collaborations and new initiatives. There
will be daily gathering for discussing specific topics, new results,
and brainstorming.

For more details and workshop application, visit:

https://www.munich-iapbp.de/habitability

The application deadline is September 24, 2023. When applying, please
note that MIAPbP requires attendance for at least two weeks (10 working
days).

Financial support is available at the rate of EUR 80 per day for
accommodation and local expenses. Additional financial support for
attendees with family and children, and for graduate students is also
available. Please see the details at:

https://www.munich-iapbp.de/for-visitors/financial-support

We look forward to receiving your applications.

THE 15TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SUBSTORMS (ICS-15): ABSTRACT
SUBMISSION DEADLINE EXTENSION

We are extending the abstract submission deadline to Aug 14, 2023 for
the 15th International Conference on Substorms (ICS-15), which is to be
held in Deqing, China from October 16-20, 2023. The conference aims to
bring together scientists from the magnetospheric, ionospheric, and
planetary communities to review the recent discoveries in light of
recent space missions and numerical simulations, and to discuss the
current status and future direction of substorm research.
 
The meeting will be a hybrid meeting with online components. But we
strongly encourage in-person participation. Further information about
the conference is given in the meeting website:

https://ics15.cssr.org.cn/

We look forward to meeting you in China.

REMINDER: ENDURANCE SCIENCE WORKSHOP THIS WEEK

The Endurance Science Workshop will be held this week from Wednesday,
August 9 to Friday, August 11 at Caltech and online. You can find the
agenda and register for this hybrid workshop at:

https://www.hou.usra.edu/meetings/endurance2023/
 
Endurance is a mission concept to explore and ultimately return samples
from the Moon's largest and oldest impact basin, South Pole-Aitken
(SPA). The Endurance Science Workshop is an opportunity for broader
community to come together to discuss the science for this mission
concept, and document information that could feed forward into future
concept studies and science definition activities.
