DPS-EPSC 2023 HYBRID MEETING: SAVE THE DATE

Join us 1-6 October 2023 for the 55th Annual Division for Planetary
Sciences (DPS) joint meeting with the Europlanet Science Congress
(EPSC). Be sure to save the date and plan to attend, either in person
or online:

https://aas.org/meetings/dps55

Being a joint meeting with the Europlanet Society (EPS) the topics
cover all areas of planetary science, including those beyond the
astronomical topics traditionally related to AAS/DPS meetings. As a
hybrid meeting, we anticipate a large attendance both in person at the
Marriott Rivercenter Hotel in San Antonio Texas and online.

Solar eclipse aficionados and educators will enjoy an adjacent workshop
on solar eclipse planning held on 29-30 September 2023:

SOLAR WIND 16: REGISTRATION OPEN

Registration is open for the Solar Wind 16 meeting, to be held June
12-16, 2023 at the Asilomar Conference Grounds on the Monterey
Peninsula in California. Asilomar was the site of the Solar Wind 2 and
3 meetings, in 1971 and 1974 respectively, and is especially
well-suited to informal discussion.

The meeting will be organized around a group of 'scene-setting' talks
which will describe the state-of-the-art in topics of solar wind
heating and acceleration mechanisms, solar wind sources, transients,
interaction with planets, and the relationship to broader problems in
astrophysics. Contributed talks and posters will be organized around
these scene-setting talks and there will be plenty of time for open
discussion.

A goal of the meeting is to come away from the week with some consensus
as the state of the field and ideas about where to go next. The new
measurements from DKIST, Solar Orbiter, and Parker Solar Probe will
frame these discussion and make this Solar Wind meeting especially
timely. This meeting will also take the 2023 place of the annual
'Parker' series.

OPEN CALL FOR SUBMISSIONS TO AN ICARUS SPECIAL ISSUE ON SOLAR SYSTEM
ICES

Ices in the Solar System: origin, evolution and distribution

Ices, whether composed of frozen water or other frozen species, are
ubiquitous in the Solar System. They have been observed, deduced,
and/or hypothesized on bodies large and small and at, near, or buried
below surfaces. They are ephemeral, periodic, or relatively
long-standing and stable. They can be at or near-thaw temperatures on
some bodies and far away from thaw on others. Ice origins are as
diverse as the species themselves and the locations where they are
observed, deduced, or hypothesized. Some ices date back to the origin
of the Solar System; others do not and may be much more recent if not
contemporary. This special issue aims to fuse a diverse group of
early-, mid-, and senior-career planetary scientists whose work focuses
on ices and provide a dynamic platform for presenting and exchanging
their most current observations, interpretations, hypotheses, and/or
explanations. Discussion of mission-exploration plans and options,
current and/or proposed, also would be welcomed.

PLANETARY SCIENCE ADVISORY COMMITTEE NOMINATIONS 

The Planetary Science Advisory Committee (PAC) supports the advisory
needs of the Planetary Science Division (PSD), the Science Mission
Directorate (SMD), and other mission directorates as required, as well
as the NASA Administrator. The advisory scope of the PAC includes all
aspects of NASA's planetary science program, including scientific
research; considerations of the development of near-term enabling
technologies, systems, and computing and information management
capabilities; and developments with the potential to provide long-term
improvements in future mission operational systems.  Responsibility for
biological planetary protection is outside the purview of the PAC.
NASA's PSD is extending an invitation for nominations for service on
the PAC. Interested members of the community are invited to review the
charter and to submit nominations (including self-nominations) for
consideration to fill vacancies on the Committee.
