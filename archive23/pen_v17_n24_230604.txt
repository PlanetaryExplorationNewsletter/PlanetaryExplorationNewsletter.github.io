OPEN MEPAG STEERING AND GOALS COMMITTEE POSITIONS
 
MEPAG is currently seeking one individual to serve on the Steering
Committee (SC), and three individuals to serve on the Goals Committee
(GC). This call replaces a recent call from the month of April and
previous applicants must apply through this updated form.

The application form can be found at:

https://forms.gle/TAkdKKZejH11GWiQ9
 
Participation in the Steering Committee includes a monthly
teleconference, participation in MEPAG community meetings (virtual and
hybrid), review of MEPAG reports, occasional participation on Science
Analysis Groups (SAGs), and related activities.
 
The GC openings are split between Goal II (Climate), Goal III
(Geology), and Goal IV (Preparation for Humans). Participation in the
Goals Committee includes periodic reviews of the MEPAG Goals document,
writing of updates as needed, and other goals-related activities as
directed by the SC.
 
Committee membership is open to both qualified US and international
participants. Representation of the diverse membership of the Mars

MICROSATELLITES AND THEIR USE IN PLANETARY AND ASTROBIOLOGY RESEARCH
WORKSHOP

The aim of the workshop Microsatellites and their use in planetary and
astrobiology research (Tartu, Estonia, 1-8 August 2023) will be to
enable students and early career scientists to design micro-and
nanosatellite missions tackling scientific themes and target objects
they have chosen themselves previously. The workshop will consist of
three parts:
- a lectured part consisting of in-depth talks
- a mission designing part where attendees plan these endeavours in
  detail with the help of satellite technologists
- a final presentation of all the projects

The workshop aims to:
- Highlight the possible potential of microsatellites in exploring
  different targets like the Moon, small bodies and outer satellites
- Foster the interaction between space researchers and technologists
- Allow participants to start the design and planning of new space
  missions
- Contribute to the training of a new generation of space researchers

The workshop will consist of lectures by leading scientists, planning
of for different micro- or nanosatellite projects in small groups as
well as open discussions. Participants will also have the possibility
to display their own research results in a poster session.

[NASA] SMD: F.23 SMD BRIDGE PROGRAM SEED FUNDING CLARIFICATION

The SMD Bridge Seed Funding Program Element of ROSES-2023 (F.23)
solicits proposals to provide support for faculty investigators and
their students at under-resourced institutions (URIs) to carry out
NASA-relevant research. Through the BPSF program, SMD aims to
facilitate new and expand ongoing partnerships between students and
faculty at URIs and researchers at NASA Centers that could be expected
to grow into Bridge partnerships and become well-positioned to submit a
proposal to the future SMD Bridge Program opportunity in ROSES-2023.
 
Section 1 of F.23 Bridge Program Seed Funding (BPSF) has been clarified
to indicate that eligibility is based on SMD grant funding, and that
STEM fields counting toward the 20 PhD graduation limit are those
relevant to SMD strategic objectives. Sections 1 and 3.5 have been
updated to clarify requirements for the NASA partner. Section 3.7 has
been added, to explain rolling submissions and clarify the rules
regarding resubmissions and duplicate proposals. The email address has
been updated to hq-smd-bridge@mail.nasa.gov. New text is in bold.
