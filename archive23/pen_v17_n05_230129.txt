GOLDSCHMIDT 2023 THEME 10G: GEOBIOLOGY LIFE IN EARTH AND PLANETARY
SYSTEMS PROCESSES - BIOSIGNATURE DIVERSITY, PRESERVATION, AND
DETECTION THROUGH GEOLOGIC TIME

Goldschmidt will take place from July 9-14 in Lyons, France. Abstracts
are due by March 1st. 

We invite contributions from all fields that investigate the connection
between microorganisms and their (paleo)environments, including efforts
on in situ and remote detection of biosignatures, their synthesis and
analysis, and potential synthesis in prebiotic systems. Submissions
highlighting novel analytical, experimental, and modeling approaches
are encouraged. This session is explicitly open to multi-discipline
approaches that incorporate methods coming from different branches of
science. We welcome all career stages (early to senior) and research
related to any planetary body or environment (rocky, icy, ocean,
gaseous).

ABSTRACT SUBMISSION REMINDER FOR THERMOPS IV

This is a reminder that abstract submission for the Fourth Workshop on
Thermal Models for Planetary Science will close on 3 February 2023
(23:00 UTC).
 
TherMoPS IV will be held at the European Space Research and Technology
Centre (ESTEC) in Noordwijk, The Netherlands, 18-20 April, 2023.
Remote participation will be possible for those unable to attend
in-person. We expect to be able to offer some travel support for young
professionals to attend in-person. Details will be announced when
registration opens.

Registration for the workshop will open when the workshop programme is
published on 27 February.
 
Themes identified for abstract submission include:
- Thermal modelling of rocky planets, asteroids and small bodies, the
  Moon and moons of the Solar System, and gas giants;
- Technical aspects of thermal modelling such as: models of thermal
  evolution and thermal conductivity, disk-integrated vs disk-resolved
  approaches, advances in theory and computational techniques, and;
- Research to investigate thermal processes and validate thermal
  models, via laboratory work and observations from observatories or
  spacecraft.

JPGU 2023 SESSION: OUTER SOLAR SYSTEM EXPLORATION TODAY AND TOMORROW

Please consider submitting an abstract to the "Outer Solar System
Exploration Today and Tomorrow" session at the Japan Geoscience Union
(JpGU) Meeting held on May 21-26, 2023 in Makuhari, Japan near Tokyo.
 
Our session will discuss a wide range of topics encompassing the giant
planets and their moons, including their origins, interiors,
atmospheres, compositions, surface features, and electromagnetic
fields. To advocate for current and future outer planets exploration
(Juno, New Horizons, JUICE, Europa Clipper, Dragonfly and beyond), we
also call for discussions on future missions to explore giant planet
systems, including how to develop better international cooperation.
Among new topics, we especially encourage presentations about new
scientific results generated using data returned by space telescopes
such as the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST).

FREELY AVAILABLE PUBLIC TALKS: FORMING AND EXPLORING HABITABLE WORLDS 

To reach many young people, educators, and others - and following a
successful conference in Edinburgh during November - we have recordings
of the accessible Public Talks that took place. 
 
The recordings aim to broaden engagement and spark conversations on the
exciting topics of:
- what planets are and how they form,  
- how and why we explore space,  
- the rise of life on Earth and other possible habitable worlds and
  aliens(?) leading to the question - are we alone in the cosmos?  

These talks also seek to provide examples of how space exploration
links with peoples' lives / culture on Earth while giving a sense of
humanity's responsibilities in venturing beyond our home world. 

We hope that you, your classes, community groups, and/or family and
friends enjoy these recordings whenever convenient for you.

[NASA] LUNAR SURFACE TECHNOLOGY RESEARCH (LUSTR) OPPORTUNITIES APPENDIX
RELEASED

NASA's Space Technology Mission Directorate (STMD) has released "Lunar
Surface Technology Research (LuSTR) Opportunities" as an appendix to
the SpaceTech-REDDI-2023 solicitation. 

The LuSTR appendix is available at:

https://tinyurl.com/2023LuSTR

Only accredited U.S. universities are eligible to submit proposals.
Teaming is permitted. See the solicitation for complete eligibility
requirements, as well as teaming restrictions.

The goal of LuSTR, part of the Lunar Surface Innovation Initiative
(LSII), is to accelerate the development of groundbreaking
technologies that support and enable lunar surface activities to be
conducted under Artemis - the core of NASA's exploration and human
spaceflight plans for the next decade. As part of the LSII portfolio,
LuSTR solicits ideas from universities that can be integrated into
Artemis' sequence of missions that start with the near-term
development of enabling infrastructure and lay the foundation for a
sustained human and robotic presence.  
 
Technical and programmatic comments and questions may be addressed by
email to the solicitation mailbox, hq-LuSTR@mail.nasa.gov.

The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Science
Mission Directorate (SMD) has released for comment a Draft Announcement
of Opportunity (AO) for 2023 Heliophysics Space Weather Vigil Focused
Mission of Opportunity. This draft solicitation was generated by the
SMD Heliophysics Division's Heliophysics Space Weather Program (SWxP)
for an investigation for a remote sensing extreme ultraviolet (EUV)
imager instrument to be hosted on the European Space Agency (ESA) Vigil
mission and to:
 
- Advance understanding of solar variability manifested as "the sudden
  release of magnetic energy that enables both flares and coronal mass
  ejections (CME) to accelerate particles to high energy efficiently";
- Enable the development "of advanced methods for forecasting and
  nowcasting of solar eruptive events and space weather";
- Make effective use of ESA instrument data in the proposed
  investigation; and
- Support objectives of the Vigil mission with the provision of low
  latency data for operational space weather applications.

Questions and comments regarding this FMO Draft AO should be emailed to
both:

James Spann, jim.spann@nasa.gov
Washito Sasamoto, washito.a.sasamoto@nasa.gov.
