  for another 2 years),
- a Geology Discipline Member (3 year nominal term),
- a Magnetosphere Discipline Member (3 year nominal term),
- an Early Career Member (3 year nominal term), and
- an International Early Career Member (3 year nominal term).
 
A detailed description for these positions, a list of the requested
application materials, and the application form are found here:

LUNAR SDI SOLICITS STANDARDS INPUT

The Lunar Spatial Data Infrastructure Working Group (Lunar SDI)
requests input on a draft set of community standards for Lunar Analysis
Ready Data. These standards are aimed at data producers, data
providers, and users. 

Lunar SDI Website:

https://bit.ly/lunarsdi

The draft standards can be found at:

https://bit.ly/lunarstandards

One of the objectives of the Lunar SDI Working Group is to facilitate
the common use of a set of standards for Lunar Analysis Ready Data.
Derived data products that are GIS-ready, using common standards, for
scientific and engineering use in off-the-shelf tools as a GIS means
that data can be efficiently utilized. Common standards also maximize
consistency in use regardless of the data source. The draft standards
we propose describe spatial, cartographic, data, and metadata
standards. We are seeking input on these standards before requesting
their common adoption by data producers and providers. 

If you are a data producer, provider, or user that generates, serves,
or uses higher level data, please consider providing feedback by
commenting on the standards page(s) directly or emailing a member of
the Lunar SDI:

https://tinyurl.com/2p9btcz9

Please provide feedback by May 31, 2023.

JOB ANNOUNCEMENT: LIFE DETECTION SCIENTIST AT NASA GODDARD

The Astrochemistry Laboratory of the Solar System Exploration Division
at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) is seeking a full-time
research scientist specializing in life detection science who would
work to connect theories of life and biological search patterns to
measurable parameters and contribute to future mission concepts. The
successful candidate will work closely with life detection instrument
technology developers to conceive of measurement approaches that are
well connected to fundamental, robust theories or models of biology and
life signatures. This research position entails developing productive
collaborative relationships, leading ground-breaking research, and
providing input into future mission/instrument design. This is a
GS-13/14 level civil servant position located at NASA-Goddard in
Greenbelt, Maryland near Washington, DC. As a government position,

[NASA] SUPPORT FOR PLANETARY SAMPLE SCIENCE COOPERATIVE AGREEMENT
NOTICE AND QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS RELEASED

Step-1 Proposals Due: June 12, 2023
Step-2 Proposals Due: July 24, 2023
 
The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Science
Mission Directorate (SMD) has released a Cooperative Agreement Notice
(CAN) entitled "Support for Planetary Sample Science (SPSS)". 

https://tinyurl.com/mw699juw

The final SPSS CAN invites the submission of proposals to support
members of the planetary science community to conduct science
activities that use NASA's extraterrestrial samples for a public
purpose. Scientific studies of such samples have proven valuable for
informing our understanding of the Solar System. NASA's Planetary
Science Division (PSD) has long provided support for community research
with these samples. Through this CAN, NASA seeks to continue to provide
this support to enable community research.
 
Any additional questions or requests for clarification regarding the
SPSS CAN should be emailed to Stephen.A.Rinehart@nasa.gov.

[NASA] REQUEST FOR INFORMATION: SPACE WEATHER AND SCIENCE AGILE
PLATFORMS

Response Date: June 12, 2023, 11:59pm Eastern time
Direct Short URL:

https://go.nasa.gov/SWAPSRFI
 
NASA's Science Mission Directorate (SMD) seeks information to assess
commercial interest in and opportunities for the in-space hosting of
science instruments that will directly address science and/or
applications needs for space weather and other NASA science
disciplines, e.g., astrophysics, Earth science, heliophysics, and
planetary science. NASA is interested in increasing its use of
commercial platforms to reduce the cost and schedule of space weather
and science missions. Specifically, NASA is seeking to learn about
possible opportunities to host instruments on existing commercial and
Other Government Agency (OGA) missions (non-NASA driven) and understand
accommodations available on those opportunities. Information collected
through this RFI will support programmatic decisions regarding
approaches for hosted payload opportunities.
