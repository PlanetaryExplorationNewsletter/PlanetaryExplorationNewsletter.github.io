CALL TO ACTION: PETITION CONGRESS FOR 2029 LAUNCH DATE FOR VERITAS

The VERITAS team needs your help. NASA selected VERITAS in June 2021
and then put the mission on hold this past November despite us being
on time and on budget. Now we are scheduled to launch "no earlier than
2031".

To maintain our schedule as much as possible, we are working to
petition Congress to stipulate a 2029 launch date for VERITAS. If you
are willing and able, please visit the URL below (and sign) the
petition to our elected officials. We realize that many are unable to
participate in this petition given your affiliations, but please share
this with any U.S. friends and family you may have who are able to do
so.

Support Veritas:

If you would like more information about the situation VERITAS finds
itself in, please feel free to reach out to me or anyone else on the
VERTIAS team.

Thank you for your support,

Jenny Whitten

Associate Deputy PI of VERITAS

4TH DUST, ATMOSPHERE, AND PLASMA ENVIRONMENT OF THE MOON AND SMALL
BODIES 

The 4th Dust, Atmosphere, and Plasma Environment of the Moon and Small
Bodies (DAP-2023) will be a three-day workshop from June 5-7, 2023 in
Boulder, CO.

Abstract submission (deadline March 31, 2023) and registration
(deadline May 15, 2023) are open at:

https://impact.colorado.edu/dap/2023.

The DAP-2023 workshop will be hosted by the SSERVI-IMPACT team at the
University of Colorado, and will be a forum to 
1. Discuss our current understanding of the surface environment of the
   Moon and other small bodies, 
2. Share new results from past and ongoing missions to the moon,
   airless bodies and comets, and 
3. Describe expectations, problems, and solutions for planned future
   missions to dusty destinations.

DAP-2023 will follow the traditions of three previous workshops,
LDAP-2010, DAP-2012, and DAP-2017.

Best regards,
Tobin Munsat, Xu Wang, Mihaly Horanyi, Jan Deca, Addie Dove, and Jorge

OPAG MAY HYBRID MEETING, LIGHTNING TALKS AND POSTER SESSION

The next Outer Planets Assessment Group (OPAG) meeting will be held on
May 2-3, 2023 as a hybrid meeting, virtually and at the Johns Hopkins
Applied Physics Lab in Laurel, MD. 

OPAG will host a poster session on the evening of May 2, for in-person
attendees. Posters can focus on Inclusion, Diversity, Equity, and
Accessibility (IDEA), research, mission concepts, technology
developments, etc. A brief lightning talk (1-2 min) will be given by
presenters to advertise the posters.

For virtual attendees who would like to present, we can offer a longer
lightning talk (4-5 minutes, depending on the number of presentations).

OPAG looks forward to providing this opportunity for you to showcase
your work and network! If you wish to give a lightning talk
(virtually or in person) please fill out this form by April 20, 2022.

If you have questions, please contact:
Kate Craft: Kate.Craft@jhuapl.edu and

EXPLORING MARS TOGETHER: A PLAN FOR A SUSTAINABLE FUTURE FOR SCIENCE AT
MARS

Over the past year, the Mars Exploration Program (MEP) has been
thinking strategically about ways to guide the Mars program through the
next two decades. The product of this work, Exploring Mars Together: A
Plan for a Sustainable Future for Science at Mars, outlines a draft
vision for scientific exploration, technology development,
infrastructure, and community partnerships that will make the Mars
program of the future robust, resilient, and reflective of our diverse
community.
 
A draft of this plan was presented at the National Academies of
Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (NASEM) Committee on Astrobiology
and Planetary Science (CAPS) meeting on March 29, 2023. A presentation
is also planned for the MEPAG 40 Hybrid Meeting on April 11-12, 2023 in
Washington DC and online.
 
Reviewing the slides in advance (link below) of the MEPAG meeting on
April 11-12 will allow you time to consider the details of the draft
plan. As always, the MEP will welcome your feedback.

PHD POSITION IN SPACE RESEARCH/MASS SPECTROMETRY AT THE UNIVERSITY OF
BERN, SWITZERLAND
 
Comet Interceptor (CI), the European Space Agency's new F-class
mission, is currently under development to fly past a pristine comet.
The University of Bern is the lead institute of the mass spectrometer
suite MANiaC (Mass Analyzer for Neutrals in a Coma) which is dedicated
to the investigation of the gas coma surrounding the comet.
 
The PhD contains both theoretical and lab work in the field of comets
and spacecraft instrumentation. A key aspect is the characterization of
CI/MANiaC and includes operation, characterization, and calibration of
the different instrument models and subunits.
 
The position requires a Master of Science degree in physics or a
closely related field in engineering. Experience in instrumentation,
lab work, and programming languages are a clear advantage. Interested
applicants should send their curriculum vitae (including professional
experience), a one-page motivation letter, the contact details of two
reference persons, and the grades obtained at the Master level to Dr.
Martin Rubin (martin.rubin@unibe.ch).
