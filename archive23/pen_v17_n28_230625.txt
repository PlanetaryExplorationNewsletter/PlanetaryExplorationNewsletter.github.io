SIMS COMMUNITY FACILITY WORKSHOP SURVEY: LOOKING FOR FEEDBACK!

From 2012-2020 the NSF-supported Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry (SIMS)
Community Facility at Arizona State University has hosted annual
in-person workshops. We have enjoyed sharing our lab with the many
workshop participants over the years. However, we recognize this may
not be the best way to reach all the interested parties.

We are looking for your input on how to proceed with our workshop
programming. The survey below will only take 5 mins or less! We are
considering taking a more proactive approach by assisting graduate
students and/or early career scientists to acquire pilot data for
future science proposals.

Please fill out the following survey by July 31, 2023:

LIBRARIES AROUND THE NATION LOOKING FOR ECLIPSE PROGRAMS AND HELP  

In preparation for the eclipse-of-the-Sun "double-header" that will be
visible across the U.S. this October and next April, about ten thousand
public libraries will make 5 million safe-solar-viewing glasses (and
information packets) available to their communities, thanks to a major
grant from the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation.  
 
The librarians, most of whom do not have science training, are looking
for help with public outreach from people who know about eclipse
science and safe solar-viewing techniques. To learn more and volunteer
to help your local library (or virtually support any library across the
nation!), please go to:

GSA SESSION T102: GEOMORPHOLOGY AND LANDSCAPE EVOLUTION OF MARS

The geomorphology of Mars provides insight into the planet's complex
history. Detailed observations and analyses of the surface allows for
interpretations not only of the mechanics and processes at work on
Mars, but on Earth as well. This session focuses on aeolian, fluvial,
glacial, lacustrine, and crater degradation processes to investigate
the geomorphology, geology, and climate history of Mars. We welcome
abstracts describing research utilizing orbital and in situ Martian
datasets, as well as terrestrial analogues, to better understand the
landscape evolution of Mars. Research at all stages from members of the
community at all levels and backgrounds are encouraged to share their
work in this session.  
 
We're excited to welcome Lior Rubanenko (Stanford) and Claire Mondro
(Caltech) as our session's invited speakers!
 
The abstract deadline is July 25, 2023. For more information, or to

AGU SESSION P014: EXPLORING ARCHEAN EARTH TO UNDERSTAND ARCHEAN-LIKE
EXOPLANETS

Whilst Archean Earth had a habitable ecosystem with signs of an
extensive microbial biosphere, it was distinct from modern Earth in
many ways. With a fainter young Sun, CO2 partial atmospheric pressures
were likely much higher than today, O2 was negligible, and total
surface pressure may have been lower. The area of exposed continents
was possibly smaller, plate tectonics may have operated in a different
style, and hence weathering and volatile cycling were modified.
Day-length, ocean circulation and possibly ocean salinity differed from
today. Rates of atmospheric escape under conditions of higher extreme
solar ultraviolet and different atmospheric composition remain to be
explored. Analogs of Archean Earth may exist around stars of other
types and be more common than modern Earth twins.

We invite presentations related to Archean geological proxies
(atmosphere, biosphere, geosphere), models (dynamical, thermal,
geochemical), and possible exoplanet connections (atmospheric
biosignatures, climate, atmospheric escape).

AGU SESSION P026: MARTIAN SULFATES STUDIED USING ORBITAL, GROUND,
LABORATORY, AND EARTH DATA

The sulfur cycle is an important component of geochemical evolution on
Mars and its geological influence has been identified in numerous
rocks, sediments, soils, and aqueous depositional environments.
Volcanism, climate, weathering, and erosion appear to be key players in
sulfur cycling throughout the atmosphere, hydrosphere, and lithosphere
on Mars, which in many cases are similar to Earth. Sulfates are a
common mineral detected on the martian surface in association with a
wide range of features, from km-size light-toned deposits to cm-thick
Ca-sulfate veins within the bedrock. In this session, we invite
contributions describing advances in current knowledge of sulfates
detected (i) in orbital observations of Mars, (ii) by the in-situ rover
investigations, (iii) in field analog studies of sulfate deposits found
on Earth, (iv) in laboratory measurements (spectral signatures, other
properties of sulfates), and (v) processes and models describing
formation and cycling of sulfates on Mars and Earth.

AGU SESSION P027: MERCURY IN THE SOLAR WIND

Mercury being the Solar System's innermost, smallest and orbitally most
eccentric planet has a unique interaction with the solar wind. The
planet is airless but has a surface-originating exosphere, a global
magnetic field and a large conducting core. These properties result in
a compact-sized space weather environment with fast phenomena,
multi-ion plasma composition and highly varying upstream conditions.
Mercury was extensively observed by the MESSENGER spacecraft and new
measurements come from the BepiColombo mission en route to Mercury.

Here we welcome all contributions on the physics of the Hermean
magnetosphere-exosphere-surface-interior solar wind interaction system.
Foreseen themes include, but are not limited to, the generation,
structure and dynamics of the foreshock, bow shock, magnetopause,
magnetotail, waves, instabilities, precipitation, exosphere, particle
acceleration, magnetic reconnection and induction effects or coulings
between these. Applied methods can be, for example, spacecraft data
analysis, numerical simulations, theory, laboratory and remote sensing
work or novel future approaches.

Abstract submission is open until Aug 2, 2023.

The Europa Clipper mission is hosting an AGU session open to the
entirety of the planetary science and exploration community! Please
consider submitting an abstract per the below text. The session will
include speakers internal and external to the mission.
 
Topics of the session include research related to the Science Goal and
Objectives of the mission, organized around the themes of habitability,
geology, interior, composition, and recent activity of Europa,
including studies of the interaction of Europa with the Jovian
environment. Additionally, we welcome comparative studies of other
Ocean Worlds with implications for Europa, and contributions regarding
technologies and concepts that would build upon the foundation set by
Europa Clipper for future exploration.

AGU SESSION P041: THE NEW MARS UNDERGROUND

The characterization of the Martian subsurface is progressing at an
unprecedented pace, stimulated by several extended missions, the
preparation for Mars Sample Return, the proposed Mars Life Explorer,
and human exploration in the coming decades. Ongoing efforts aim at
characterizing 1) the physical, chemical, and thermodynamical
properties of the Martian interior; 2) the distribution and stability
of modern liquid water and water ice inventories; 3) the provenance,
cycling, and isotopic composition of organics and trace gases that may
serve as potential biosignatures; and 4) the identification of
habitable "refugia environments" where local conditions might be
conducive to support an extant Martian biosphere, should it exist. For
our sixth "New Mars Underground", we welcome abstracts relevant to
these themes, and to the characterization of the subsurface in general.
We anticipate contributions informed by remote observations,
theoretical modelling, mission concept development, and applied
experimentation of relevant terrestrial analogs.
 
Abstract deadline: August 2, 2023
