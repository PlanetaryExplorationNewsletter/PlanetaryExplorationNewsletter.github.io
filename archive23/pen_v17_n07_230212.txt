4TH DUST, ATMOSPHERE, AND PLASMA ENVIRONMENT OF THE MOON AND SMALL 
BODIES WORKSHOP

We are pleased to announce the 4th Dust, Atmosphere, and Plasma 
Environment of the Moon and Small Bodies (DAP-2023) workshop this 
summer. This will be a three-day workshop from June 5-7, 2023 in 
Boulder, CO.

The DAP-2023 workshop will be hosted by the SSERVI-IMPACT team at the 
University of Colorado, and will be a forum to (i) discuss our current 
understanding of the surface environment of the Moon and other small 
bodies, (ii) share new results from past and ongoing missions to the 
Moon, airless bodies and comets, and (iii) describe expectations, 
problems, and solutions for planned future missions to dusty 
destinations.

DAP-2023 will follow the tradition of three previous workshops, 
LDAP-2010, DAP-2012, and DAP-2017. Contributions to each of these 
workshops were published in special issues of Planetary and Space 
Sciences.

A more detailed announcement with abstract submission instructions and 
dates should be arriving to your inbox by the end of the month, but 
for now please mark your calendar, and we look forward to seeing you in 
Boulder this June.

Best regards,
Tobin Munsat, Xu Wang, and Mihaly Horanyi

PHD IN MODELING TIDAL DISSIPATION IN IO AT DELFT UNIVERSITY OF 
TECHNOLOGY, NETHERLANDS

The planetary exploration group at Delft University of Technology is 
advertising a fully funded PhD position on modelling tidal dissipation 
on Io. The position is aimed at developing a numerical model to link 
tidal dissipation in the interior to observations of high heatflow and 
volcanism. The focus is on modelling the feedback between heat 
generation and Io's interior structure, and the generation of melt. The 
position is suitable for (soon to be) MSc graduates in engineering or 
physics (or equivalent) with a strong background in modelling and 
programming.

The position will be for four years, with a preferred start date before 
July of 2023. The application deadline is February 22, 2023. Inquiries 
about the position can be sent to w.vanderwal@tudelft.nl. Further 
details are given here:

AOGS SESSION PS13: SURFACE PROCESSES ON ROCKY BODIES IN THE SOLAR 
SYSTEM

The session will be held during the 20th AOGS Annual Meeting on July 30
- April 4 in Singapore.

By characterizing the surface geomorphology, material properties, and
subsurface stratigraphy, our understanding of the geological processes
that have acted on rocky bodies over their history develops.
Remarkable advances in both remote sensing and in-situ exploration in
recent years have shed further light on the many outstanding questions
about the formation and evolution of the Solar System.

We would like to invite you to submit abstracts related to the
following topics, but are not limited to:
- Recent and future planetary exploration missions;
- Planetary geologic mapping;
- Planetary geomorphology;
- Planetary remote sensing;
- Planetary subsurface structure;
- Observation and characterization of asteroids and comets;
- Water, volatiles, organics;
- Thermal properties of the Moon, asteroids, and comets;
- Dust of planetary and small bodies;
- Cosmic rays, solar wind and their interaction with planetary surfaces.

Please consider submitting an abstract:

AOGS SESSION PS14: VENUS - EVOLUTION OF THE INTERIOR, SURFACE, AND 
ATMOSPHERE

The session will be held during the 20th AOGS Annual Meeting on July 30 
- April 4 in Singapore.

While many spacecraft have flown by or descended to the surface of 
Venus, it has only been visited long-term by a few orbiters, such as 
multiple Venera spacecraft from the Soviet Union, NASA's Pioneer 
Venus 1 and Magellan missions, ESA's Venus Express, and JAXA's 
currently ongoing mission Akatsuki. Four missions, including VERITAS, 
DAVINCI, EnVision and Venera D, have been selected by NASA, ESA and 
Roscosmos to explore Venus in the coming decades. In the meantime, 
China's Venus Volcano and Climate imaging Explorer (VOICE) mission is 
now one of the candidates for future missions to be implemented, and 
if selected VOICE will orbit Venus by 2030. The proposed session aims 
to consolidate our understanding of the evolutionary history of Venus 
and to better prepare focused questions for the future missions.

Looking forward to seeing you in Singapore.

PHD POSITION IN NUMERICAL MODELING OF METEORITE THERMAL AND MECHANICAL
PROPERTIES AT DLR, BERLIN

The DLR Institute of Planetary Research in Berlin is looking for a PhD 
candidate interested in numerical modeling the mechanical and thermal 
properties of extraterrestrial materials. Current space missions to 
asteroids Ryugu and Bennu as well as the analysis of returned samples

properties, but the theoretical understanding of the mechanisms 
governing their physical behavior are still lacking behind. The goal of 
this project is to develop numerical models that can be directly 
compared to laboratory experiments on analogue materials and 
meteorites.

ICFS 2023 SESSION: PLANETARY FLUVIAL SEDIMENTOLOGY AND STRATIGRAPHY

Please consider submitting an abstract to the session on Planetary 
fluvial sedimentology and stratigraphy at the International Conference 
on Fluvial Sedimentology 2023 (2-7 July 2023) in Riva del Garda, Italy.

For the full description of the session, please see:

https://www.icfs2023.it

Orbital imagery has revealed a vast, ancient fluvial stratigraphic 
record and rover missions have enabled detailed sedimentological 
studies combined with mineralogical and chemical analyses. In some 
instances, the stratigraphic record encoding details of that Mars' 
history and the signature of potential habitability is clearly visible 
and accessible both from orbiter and rover. Considering ongoing and 
future exploration missions aim to find potentially habitable 
environments, fluvial sedimentary rock outcrops therefore make 
desirable targets. This session invites contributions toward Martian 
fluvial sedimentary geology. I We welcome presentations that utilise 
appropriate Earth analogues, both modern and ancient and/or 
laboratory/numerical simulation. As ongoing and upcoming rover 
missions are providing increased opportunity to study extraterrestrial 
sedimentary strata, understanding directly accessible Earth analogues 
from which to base comparisons has never been more essential. We 
especially welcome contributions from early-career scientists and 
sedimentologists who are new to planetary science.

Best wishes,

Francesco Salese, Gian Gabriele Ori
