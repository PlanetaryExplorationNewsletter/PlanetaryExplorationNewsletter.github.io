HELP SUPPORT A FINAL EXTENSION OF THE ESA CLUSTER MISSION

We are writing as the Cluster Principal Investigators to inform you 
that a positive decision by ESA to support a final extension of the 
Cluster mission during 2023-2025 is in doubt. We would like to ask for 
your help in our efforts to persuade ESA to support a final extension. 

Please simply visit the following link, and add your 
name/institute/nation at the end of the google document.

https://tinyurl.com/4fhfxt26

The document consists of a letter that the Cluster PIs have drafted to 
send to ESA's Director of Science and the members of its Science 
Programme Committee (SPC). We aim to send the completed letter in 
mid-January, ahead of a key SPC Workshop in early February (which 
itself precedes the SPC meeting in March at which the extension 
decision is expected to be formalised).

Please feel free to share this email with colleagues that may be 
interested; our mailing list is not comprehensive.

Thank you in advance, if you choose to indicate your support.

Best wishes,

The Cluster Principal Investigators

TWO YEAR POSTDOCTORAL SCHOLARSHIP IN MODELING PLASMA INTERACTION WITH 
PLANETARY BODIES

The Department of Physics at Umea University in Sweden is offering a 
postdoctoral scholarship in modeling plasma interaction with planetary 
bodies. The scholarship is full-time for two years and the start date 
will be 1 April, 2023, or by agreement. The aim of our project is to 
advance our current understanding on the kinetic interaction between 
the solar wind and planetary bodies of different sizes and 
characteristics with the main focus on atmospheric evolution using a 
hybrid model of plasma. Application deadline is 10 February, 2023.

[NASA] TOWN HALL ON THE UPDATED SCIENTIFIC INFORMATION POLOCY FOR THE 
SCIENCE MISSION DIRECTORATE (SPD-41A) ON JANUARY 17

NASA's Science Mission Directorate is hosting a virtual community town 
hall on Tuesday, January 17, 2023, from 1:00 to 2:00 p.m. (Eastern). 
This town hall will highlight the recently updated Scientific 
Information Policy for the Science Mission Directorate (SPD-41a). The 
presentation will include an overview of additional guidance, training, 
and services to support researchers in implementing policy 
requirements, as described on the SMD Scientific Information Policy web 
page.

Public questions will be addressed at the end of the presentation. 
Questions may be submitted before or during the event using the tool at 
this link: 

https://nasa.cnf.io/sessions/tgn4/#!/dashboard

The town hall will be recorded and posted on the SMD Scientific 
Information Policy web page following the event. Please contact 
HQ-SMD-SPD41@mail.nasa.gov with any questions about this event.

GSA PENROSE CONFERENCE - THE ROLE OF OUTBURST FLOODS IN EARTH AND 
PLANETARY EVOLUTION

The GSA Penrose Conference, "The Role of Outburst Floods in Earth and 
Planetary Evolution," will take place from June 5-9, 2023, at Camp 
Delany, Coulee City, Washington, situated at the foot of the 
spectacular flood-carved Dry Falls in Grand Coulee.

This conference will encompass the range of outburst flood science, 
focused on four key themes: (1) Channeled Scabland and the Missoula 
Floods; (2) the universal occurrence of outburst floods on Earth and 
other planets; (3) the mechanics of outburst flood processes; and (4) 
broader Earth system and societal implications of outburst floods. The 
conference will review past work, address the current state of 
research, and help chart the future of outburst flood science through 
presentations, discussions, and multiple field trips.

Applications are currently open and close on January 27, 2023. All 
pertinent information can be found at: 

https://www.jsg.utexas.edu/penrose-2023 

Please direct any questions to penrose-2023@geo.utexas.edu.

Thanks, and we hope to see you at Camp Delany!
