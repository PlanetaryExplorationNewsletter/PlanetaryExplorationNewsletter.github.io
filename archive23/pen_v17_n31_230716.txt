POSTDOC POSITION IN EXOPLANET ATMOSPHERES AT THE SPACE RESEARCH
INSTITUTE IIWF
 
The Space Research Institute (IWF) of the Austrian Academy of Sciences
(OeAW), is offering a PostDoc Position in Exoplanet atmospheres - links
to observations. The successful candidate will join the IWF research
group "Exoplanets: Weather & Climate" led by Prof. Christiane Helling
as part of the OeAW's efforts to expand the theme of exoplanet research
at the IWF in Graz, Austria. The candidate is expected to contribute by
linking complex modelling results to observations and by doing
scientific data interpretation and preparation for PLATO, Ariel, and
other future missions.
 
The applicant must hold a PhD in the relevant fields of astrophysics.
The appointment begins as early as November 1, 2023 and will be for
three years.
 
Applications must include (1) CV, (2) publication list, (3) research
experience statement (max 2 pages) and research plan (max 1 page), (4)
academic certificates, and (5) two references letters. Please send the
application as one PDF file, mentioning Job ID: IWF051PD123 to Cosima
Muck, cosima.muck@oeaw.ac.at, no later than July 20, 2023.

MPEC WATCH, A WEB-BASED DIGESTION OF MINOR PLANET ELECTRONIC CIRCULARS

MPEC Watch is a web-based utility that digests the IAU Minor Planet
Center's "Minor Planet Electronic Circulars" (MPECs), developed and
maintained by the NASA Planetary Data System's Small Bodies Node. It
presents statistical summaries, plots and metrics of the observations
and orbits of near-Earth objects, comets, trans-Neptunian objects, and
natural satellites, breaking down to aggregate annual totals, as well
as for individual observing sites. The service is fed by a curated
SQLite database that contains metadata for all MPECs dating back to the
first Circular in 1993.

MPEC Watch is available at:

https://sbnmpc.astro.umd.edu/mpecwatch/

The source code is available through its GitHub repository. The SQLite
database will be made publicly available in the near future. The
service is continuously being upgraded, and we welcome feedback and
suggestions from the community.

AGU SESSION GP016: PLANETARY MAGNETISM AND PROTOPLANETARY DISK
MAGNETISM

We invite you to submit an abstract to the GP016 session at AGU 2023.
We seek contributions related to planetary and protoplanetary magnetic
fields. Please see the abstract below for more information:

Magnetic fields of various origins allow for the study of the internal
structure and geologic history of planetary bodies, and the evolution
of the early Solar System. Magnetic data are typically available from
satellites, meteorites, or from surface measurements. In this session
we welcome contributions that cover observational, experimental, and
theoretical investigations (including method development) of the
magnetosphere, crustal magnetism, core dynamics, protoplanetary disk
magnetism and other planetary-body internal magnetic sources.

Please submit your abstract at:

https://agu.confex.com/agu/fm23/prelim.cgi/Session/189550  

Feel free to reach out with any questions!

AGU SESSION P032: ONWARD TO THE MOON - A NEW ERA OF SCIENCE
 
We welcome you to join us at this year's AGU Fall Meeting, showcasing
early career research!

The return to the Moon represents an exciting new era for lunar
science. Missions such as the Artemis, Chang'e, Chandrayaan, and
commercial programs offer incredible opportunities to develop a deeper
scientific understanding of our nearest celestial neighbor. This
session calls for novel and interdisciplinary approaches to
investigating the Moon, not only through existing and future
surface-based measurements and remote sensing, but also their
integration with laboratory investigations and computational modeling.
Areas of particular interest include dust, volatiles, radiation,
geological processes and their mutual interactions. Early career
researchers, including graduate students, are especially encouraged to
submit for oral presentations!
 
Please submit here:

https://agu.confex.com/agu/fm23/prelim.cgi/Session/188846
 
Abstracts are due Wednesday, 2 August 2023.
 
We look forward to seeing you in San Francisco and online!

AGU SESSION EP036: SURFACE PROCESSES ACROSS THE SOLAR SYSTEM

Terrestrial bodies across the Solar System are shaped by surface
processes. As such, geomorphic principles and models derived for the
Earth are often applied to extraterrestrial landscapes, providing
critical insights into their geologic and climatic histories, as well
as their habitability potential. This session's goal is to explore the
interplays between quantitative models of planetary surface processes
and the challenges imposed on these models by new planetary data. We
invite contributions in the field of planetary surface processes that
use theoretical and numerical modeling, terrestrial analogues,
laboratory experiments, and planetary exploration data from robotic
spacecraft. We intend for this session to foster more collaboration
between members of the Planetary Science (PS) and the Earth and
Planetary Surface Processes (EPSP) sections, and to continue to build
a diverse community founded on interdisciplinary and collaborative
approaches.

Please submit your abstract by August 2:

Hope to see you at AGU!

Session Convenors: Marisa Palucis (Dartmouth College), Mackenzie Day
(UCLA), and Una Gaylin Schneck (MIT)
