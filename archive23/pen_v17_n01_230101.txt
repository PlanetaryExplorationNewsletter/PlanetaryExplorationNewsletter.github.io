PLANETARY SCIENCE RESEARCH POSITION AT NASA'S MARSHALL SPACE FLIGHT 
CENTER

The Heliophysics and Planetary Science Branch at NASA's Marshall Space 
Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama seeks a scientist to solve 
challenging Planetary Science problems. The permanent position is 
expected to be announced in January 2023 under the category of Research 
Space Scientist, at the GS-13 or GS-14 grade level, depending on 
qualifications.

The incumbent Planetary Scientist will have expertise in remote and/or 
in-situ sensing of planets, moons, and asteroids, and in the 
application and development of advanced tools, techniques, and/or data 
analysis/mining/machine learning techniques. The candidate will lead 
the development of research proposals for new activities, lead a 
research team, execute funded projects, participate in conferences, 
author research papers in peer-reviewed literature, and have a 
demonstrated publication record.

The formal announcement of the opportunity and requirements will be 
posted at USAJobs: 

https://www.usajobs.gov 

Searching with keyword "NASA" and location "Huntsville, Alabama".
Applications are only accepted through the USAJobs portal. When 
answering the opportunity, review carefully and address in detail, 
the Specialized Experience under Qualifications. Candidates should 
create a USAJobs profile well in advance. Informal inquiries can be 
directed to Dr. David McKenzie, david.e.mckenzie@nasa.gov,

AOGS SESSION PS10: ADVANCES IN MODELING THE FORMATION, ATMOSPHERIC, AND 
GEOLOGICAL PROPERTIES OF HABITABLE PLANETS

We cordially invite you to submit abstracts to the AOGS session PS10, 
Advances in Modeling the Formation, Atmospheric, and Geological 
Properties of Habitable Planets. The session will be held during the 
20th AOGS Annual Meeting on July 30 - April 4 in Singapore.

During the past few years, major advances were made to model the 
formation, and explain the geological and atmospheric properties of 
potentially habitable planets. New theories have been developed and 
computational models have become deeply sophisticated. These advances 
have also paved the way for extending new ideas to the formation and 
characterization of other planetary systems. The session PS10 focuses 
on these topics through a combination of invited, contributed, and 
poster presentations. We welcome abstracts for oral and poster 
contributions in all areas related to theoretical, observational and 
experimental studies of the formation and characterization of habitable 
planets, and their geological and atmospheric properties, both in our 
Solar System and extrasolar planets.

For more details and submitting abstracts, please see:

Looking forward to seeing you in Singapore.

Abstract deadline: February 14, 2023

ACM ASTEROID NAME NOMINATIONS

The Scientific Organizing Committee (SOC) of the Asteroids Comets 
Meteors (ACM) conference recognizes the tradition of announcing new 
asteroid names for (recent, at the time of the meeting) PhD recipients 
in ACM fields. This tradition will continue at the upcoming ACM to be
held in Flagstaff, Arizona June 18-23, 2023. To help make this process 
as complete as possible, supervisors, advisors, and colleagues are 
encouraged to contact any member of the SOC with nominations. 

Nominations should include a citation (<360 characters), full name, and 
birth year for the nominee. Example citations can be viewed here:

Nominations deadline: January 13, 2023

PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT WEBINAR FOR SCIENTISTS: MANAGING STRESS 
FATIGUE

On Thursday, January 5, 2023, beginning at 12:00 p.m. CT (1:00 pm ET/ 
11:00 am MT/ 10:00 am PT), the Lunar and Planetary Institute is 
offering a free, online seminar geared toward the professional 
development needs of postdoctoral researchers and early career 
scientists.

From contractual responsibilities to uncompensated obligations, 
scientists often experience intense levels of professional stress, 
particularly in early-career stages. While work-related stress may be 
inevitable, accumulated stress can lead to "stress fatigue" and 
burnout. Join the LPI on January 5 to hear from Jennifer Bates, the 
Broadening Participation Program Manager at the National Radio 
Astronomy Observatory (NRAO). She is a Licensed Clinical Social Worker 
with over 10 years of clinical experience. During her presentation, 
she will share research, recommendations, and strategies for 
addressing stress fatigue. After the presentation, there will be time 
for questions and discussion.
