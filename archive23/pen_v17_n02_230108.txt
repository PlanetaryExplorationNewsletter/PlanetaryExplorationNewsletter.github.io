SIGNATURES IN SUPPORT OF MARS EXPRESS EXTENSION

The Mars Express (MEX) team solicits the support of the scientific
community worldwide for the extension of the mission.

Current MEX operations are only approved until March 2023 and the final
decision on a new extension will be made at the ESA Science Programme
Committee meeting on 7-8 March 2023.

We invite all planetary scientists, astrobiologists, astrophysicists,
and engineers interested in Mars science to show their support signing
the following form:

APPLICATIONS NOW OPEN: OXYGEN IN PLANETARY BIOSPHERES

Green Bank Observatory May 5-7, 2023

We are pleased to announce that applications to attend the Second Barry
Blumberg Memorial Workshop in Astrobiology are now open.

This 3-day workshop at the Green Bank Observatory will focus on topics
related to the role of oxygen in the universe, planets and life, and
how the rise of oxygen on Earth may (or may not) likely have analogs on
other planets.

Recognizing the challenges the pandemic has presented for networking
over the past several years, this workshop will have a strong focus on
early career researchers, and will have broad international
participation. Presenters are encouraged to gear their talks to an
interdisciplinary audience, eschewing the trees of internecine
disciplinary debates for the forest of broader understanding.

Attendance is limited to 50 participants, by application only, and all
registration and travel expenses will be covered. The conference scope
should be construed broadly; researchers working on any related
problems are strongly encouraged to apply.

EGU2023 SESSION PS5.2: FORWARD TO THE MOON: THE SCIENCE OF EXPLORATION

NASA SSERVI invites abstracts for a lunar-focused Session (PS5.2) at
the European Geophysical Union meeting occurring 23-28 April, 2023.

Human and robotic lunar exploration is opening new vistas and
scientific understanding as humanity reaches toward the Moon again. In
partnership with institutions around the globe including 5 European
countries, NASA's Solar System Exploration Research Virtual Institute
(SSERVI) focuses on these scientific aspects of exploration as they
relate to the Moon and other airless bodies. This session will feature
interdisciplinary, exploration-related science centered around the
Moon as a human and robotic destination, including data visualization
as exemplified by SSERVI's Solar System Treks Project (SSTP) and other
platforms. Scientific plans and results within this session represent
the broad spectrum of lunar science representing investigations of the
Moon and its environment as a planetary body as well as research
uniquely enabled by from the Moon. Graduate students and early career
researchers are particularly encouraged to submit for oral
presentations.

Conveners: Greg Schmidt, Mahesh Anand, Kristina Gibbs, Brian Day.

Abstract submission deadline is 10 January 2023, 13:00 CET:

EGU2023 SESSION PS4.1: ATMOSPHERES AND EXOSPHERES OF TERRESTRIAL
PLANETS, SATELLITES, AND EXOPLANETS.

Abstract submission is open for EGU2023, held in Vienna on 23-28 April
2023 and online.

I would like to draw your attention to our session PS4.1: Atmospheres
and exospheres of terrestrial planets, satellites, and exoplanets.

This session primarily focuses on the neutral atmospheres of
terrestrial bodies other than the Earth. This includes not only Venus
and Mars, but also exoplanets with comparable envelopes and satellites
carrying dense atmospheres such as Titan or exospheres such as
Ganymede. We welcome contributions dealing with processes affecting the
atmospheres of these bodies, from the surface to the exosphere. We
invite abstracts concerning observations, both from Earth or from
space, modeling and theoretical studies, or laboratory work.
Comparative planetology abstracts will be particularly appreciated.

EGU2023 PS5.3: LUNAR SCIENCE, EXPLORATION & UTILIZATION

NASA SSERVI invites abstracts for a lunar-focused session (PS5.3) at
the European Geophysical Union meeting occurring 23-28 April, 2023. 

This session will highlight relevant recent results regarding the
exploration and sustainable utilization of the Moon through
observations, modelling, and laboratory investigations. All
past/current results and future exploration ideas and prospects are
welcome. The session brings together contributions on theoretical
models concerning the deep interior and subsurface structure and
composition; observations of the surface morphology and composition;
analyses of the atmospheric composition and dynamics; the interaction
with the solar wind, analog studies and future habitability of the
Moon. Key research questions concerning the lunar surface, subsurface,
interior and their evolution will be discussed. This session is open
to all branches of lunar science and exploration and is intended as an
open forum and discussion between diverse experts and Earth
geoscientists and explorers at large. The session will include invited
and contributed talks as well as a panel discussion and interactive
posters with short oral introduction.

EGU2023 SESSION PS7.1: EVOLUTION AND CHARACTERISATION OF EARTH-SIZED
EXOPLANETS, SUPER-EARTHS, and SUB-NEPTUNES 

We cordially invite you to submit abstracts to the session PS7.1 at the
European Geosciences Union (EGU) General Assembly, Vienna, Austria,
23-28 April 2023. 

Caroline Dorn (ETH Zurich, Switzerland) will give a keynote on "Deep
volatile reservoirs in super-Earths and sub-Neptunes". 

With advanced telescopes such as JWST, the atmospheric spectra of
exoplanets smaller than Neptune are being retrieved, which will
eventually provide insights into their atmospheric compositions.
However, understanding the planet's surface conditions, interior
structure, and its evolution through time also requires the
consideration of mineralogy and interior structure, mantle evolution,
and volatile exchange between interior and atmosphere. We invite
contributions from numerical modeling, laboratory experimental studies,
as well as observations of exoplanets and their atmospheres that focus
on predicting the evolution and on the characterisation of exoplanets.
Applications range from magma ocean planets to planets within the
habitable zone. Let us bridge the gap between prediction and
observation of small to intermediate-sized exoplanets!

POST-DOCTORAL POSITION IN SPACE WEATHER

Swedish Institute of Space Physics (IRF) is looking for a post-doctoral
position in space weather with focus on detection and characterization
of coronal mass ejections.
 
Space weather impacts technology through physical processes originating
from the Sun and its interaction with the Earth's magnetosphere and
ionosphere. The effects on technology are well-known and may influence
the operation and performance of satellites, communication, navigation,
and electrical power distribution.
 
A key component in the solar-terrestrial system is the detection and
characterization of coronal mass ejections.
 
The work will include analysis of coronal images from various
spacecraft, analysis of in-situ solar wind data, and development of
methods and algorithms. The goal is to develop models for automatic
detection of coronal mass ejections as part of IRF's space weather
system.
