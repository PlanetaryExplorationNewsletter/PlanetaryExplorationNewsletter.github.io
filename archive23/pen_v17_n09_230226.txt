ESA ANNOUNCEMENT OF OPPORTUNITY FOR MEMBERSHIP OF MMX SCIENCE STRATEGY
TEAMS
 
The JAXA-led Martian Moons eXploration (MMX) mission will launch in
2024, investigate Phobos and Deimos, and return material sampled from
the surface of Phobos to Earth for scientific analysis. Five dedicated
Science Strategy Teams (SSTs) are part of the MMX Science Working Team,
and were formed to address a set of science objectives that are derived
from the overall mission science goals.
 
The European Space Agency invites proposals for membership of the MMX
SSTs, via the following Announcement of Opportunity (AO):

https://www.cosmos.esa.int/web/mmx-ao-sst-2023
 
This AO is open to scientists affiliated with institutes in ESA Member
States:

https://tinyurl.com/mvrmewvk
 
ESA will select up to two members for each of the five SSTs. The
appointments are for a renewable term of three years and will be ad
personam.
 
Early Career Scientists are specifically encouraged to apply.
 
Proposals in PDF format must be submitted using the submission form on
the AO website linked above. 

Deadline: 22 March 2023, 12:00 (noon) Central European Time.

4TH DUST, ATMOSPHERE, AND PLASMA ENVIRONMENT OF THE MOON AND SMALL
BODIES 

The 4th Dust, Atmosphere, and Plasma Environment of the Moon and Small
Bodies (DAP-2023) will be a three-day workshop from June 5-7, 2023 in
Boulder, CO.

Abstract submission: March 31, 2023
Registration: May 15, 2023)

Workshop website: 

https://impact.colorado.edu/dap/2023.

The DAP-2023 workshop will be hosted by the SSERVI-IMPACT team at the
University of Colorado, and will be a forum to 
 - discuss our current understanding of the surface environment of the
   Moon and other small bodies, 
 - share new results from past and ongoing missions to the moon,
   airless bodies and comets, and 
 - describe expectations, problems, and solutions for planned future
   missions to dusty destinations.

DAP-2023 will follow the traditions of three previous workshops,
LDAP-2010, DAP-2012, and DAP-2017.

THE ANCIENT AND FUTURE BRINES CONFERENCE

The Ancient and Future Brines hybrid conference will be held in Reno,
Nevada from May 15-18, 2023, with an optional field trip on May 19.
This is the final conference of the Brines Across the Solar System
series. 

More information:

https://www.hou.usra.edu/meetings/ancientfuturebrines2023/.
 
The Ancient and Future Brines Conference will focus on integrating
diverse fields of study, such as geology, mineralogy, astrobiology,
chemistry, planetary science, physics, technology, and engineering. The
emphasis for this conference will be the intersections of these fields
as they apply to understanding:
 
1. The formation, location, and potential habitability of ancient
   brines on early planetary bodies
2. The role of ancient brines in the origins of life and habitable
   environments
3. The technology involved in the detection and characterization of
   brines on planetary bodies (both in situ and in returned samples)
4. The technology involved in mitigating brines in the detection and
   characterization of biosignatures
5. The role and impact of brine systems for in situ resource
   utilization
  
Abstract submission deadline: March 1, 2023, 5:00 p.m. U.S. CST (GMT-6)

Registration information will be posted soon after abstract submissions
close.
 
To be added to the mailing list, submit an indication of interest.

GOLDSCHMIDT SESSION 1F - EXOPLANET ATMOSPHERIC CHARACTERIZATION,
INTERIOR-SURFACE-ATMOSPHERE INTERACTIONS, AND PLANETARY HABITABILITY

After the detection of more than 5000 exoplanets during the past three
decades, new and upcoming advanced telescopes aim to unveil the
chemistry of the atmospheres of terrestrial-type exoplanets,
potentially including a handful of habitable zone planets. Molecules
made of C, H, N, O, and S elements are expected to be the first ones
to be detected from the atmosphere of Earth-sized exoplanets. Some key
questions are:
- How do the surface and interior of a planet affect the atmosphere
  chemistry?
- What are the implications on the origin of life as we know it?

This session will address topics on exoplanet atmospheric
characterization, interior-surface-atmosphere interactions, and
planetary habitability by bringing together planetary and exoplanet
scientists specializing in various domains including 
interior-atmosphere coupling, planetary redox states, ocean-atmosphere
interactions, ocean chemistry, atmosphere radiative transfer,
thermochemical equilibrium and kinetics, photochemistry, experimental
petrology, isotope and chamber studies, volatile cycling, geochemical
cycling, habitable zone climates, geodynamics and thermal evolution.

Abstract deadline: 1 March, 2023

Conveners:
Marie-Luise Steinmeyer (Glove Institute, University of Copenhagen),
Sebastian Danielache (Sophia University), Yamila Miguel (Leiden
Observatory), Yui Kawashima (RIKEN), Kaustubh Hakim (KU Leuven, Royal
Observatory of Belgium)
