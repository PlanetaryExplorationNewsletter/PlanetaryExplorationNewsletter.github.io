AGU SESSION DI002: EXPLORING THE INTERIORS OF ROCKY BODIES WITH
METEORITICAL, EXPERIMENTAL, AND OBSERVATIONAL APPROACHES

https://agu.confex.com/agu/fm23/prelim.cgi/Session/190340

The AGU Fall Meeting is December 11-15, 2023
Abstract deadline: August 2, 23:59 EST

The Solar System contains a diversity of rocky bodies, including large
terrestrial planets, smaller differentiated planets and moons, and
populations of even smaller asteroids and trans-Neptunian objects.
Though the interiors of these bodies exhibit a wide range of
chemistries, internal pressures, and styles of geological processing,
there is considerable overlap in the techniques used to investigate
them. This includes analysis of meteoritic samples combined with high
pressure experiments, which are complemented by spacecraft measurements
of composition, gravity, and magnetic fields. This session will
facilitate conversations regarding the contributions of various fields
to understanding the phenomena which occur inside the rocky bodies of
our Solar System, their long-term evolution, and the interactions
between their interiors and surfaces. Equal emphasis will be given to
new results based on computational modeling, spacecraft mission data,
meteorite chemistry, and geophysical experiments.

AGU SESSION DI010: OF CORES WE CAN - INTERDISCIPLINARY STUDIES OF EARTH
AND PLANETARY CORES

https://agu.confex.com/agu/fm23/prelim.cgi/Session/188890

The AGU Fall Meeting is December 11-15, 2023
Abstract deadline: August 2, 23:59 EST

A planet's core is often its most enigmatic and extreme region. A
core's dynamic evolution results from the combination of its thermal,
material, and electrical properties, which manifest in its magnetic
and seismic structures. Our understanding of these deep interior
regions is made possible through synergistic insights, and affects our
outlook on planet formation, evolution, habitability and more. With
current abilities to seismically image different planetary cores,
observe core dynamo fields with better spatio-temporal resolution,
replicate chemistry and properties at extreme conditions in labs, and
simulate their complex conditions and dynamics, we are poised for
transformative insights on planetary cores.

We bring together studies from Earth and space science disciplines
and across planetary bodies with a common goal of holistically
understanding the complex systems of Earth and planetary cores. We
encourage contributions from disciplines including, but not limited
to, seismology, mineral physics, geochemistry, paleo- and
geomagnetism, and dynamics.

AGU SESSION DI016: TRACING CHEMICAL AND ISOTOPIC SIGNATURES DURING
ROCKY BODY EVOLUTION - INTEGRATING EXPERIMENTAL AND COMPUTATIONAL
APPROACHES

https://agu.confex.com/agu/fm23/prelim.cgi/Session/191987

The AGU Fall Meeting is December 11-15, 2023
Abstract deadline: August 2, 23:59 EST

The chemical and isotopic signatures of rocky bodies in the Solar
System result from complex processes spanning their growth from dust to
their present-day states. Trends in major and trace, refractory and
volatile, and siderophile and lithophile elements, record planetary
scale processes and formation conditions. The goal of this session is
to discuss the diverse processes that influence the chemical and
isotopic reservoirs of rocky bodies during initial condensation, magma
ocean crystallization and crust formation. We invite studies that
employ interdisciplinary techniques that enhance our understanding of
the chemistry of rocky planetary bodies and the early Solar System,
including high P-T experiments, ab-initio calculations, impact and melt
simulations, and extraterrestrial sample analysis. Submissions from
early career researchers and members of underrepresented groups are
strongly encouraged.

AGU SESSION P042: ULTRAVIOLET OBSERVING OF SOLAR SYSTEM TARGETS

https://agu.confex.com/agu/fm23/prelim.cgi/Session/192562

The AGU Fall Meeting is December 11-15, 2023
Abstract deadline: August 2, 23:59 EST

Ultraviolet spectroscopy and imaging have a decades-long history as
valuable techniques for studying atmospheres, aurorae, plumes and
surface composition and volatiles on asteroids, comet nuclei and moons.
While there continue to be opportunities for UV remote sensing from
Earth orbit and in future robotic missions, the infrastructure for UV
instrumentation is at a crossroads. Existing orbital facilities are
nearing the end of their useful lives and there continue to be many
phenomena that cannot be effectively studied with existing,
high-heritage instrument designs. Exciting advances in UV-optimized
technologies promise new capabilities that can be incorporated into the
next generation of robotic probes, flexible SmallSat missions, and
large aperture space-based observatories. This session welcomes
abstracts covering UV science results, as well as reports on progress
toward developing new technologies such as UV detectors, high
performance coatings and novel sensor designs. We welcome submissions
from early career scientists and new members of the discipline.

AGU SESSION SM009: FIELDS ACROSS THE SOLAR SYSTEM - A COMPARATIVE STUDY
OF NON-RELATIVISTIC PLANETARY MAGNETOSPHERIC PROCESSES

https://agu.confex.com/agu/fm23/prelim.cgi/Session/192064

The AGU Fall Meeting is December 11-15, 2023
Abstract deadline: August 2, 23:59 EST

The Solar System hosts a variety of magnetospheric systems: e.g.,
Mercury and Earth's Dungey-cycle, the Gas Giants' Vasyliunas-cycle, the
moon dynamo of Ganymede, and the Ice Giants' complex multipolar
configurations, as well as the unmagnetized solar wind interactions at
Mars and Venus. This diversity provides valuable insights into
fundamental physical processes and their operation in different
conditions throughout the Solar System and beyond. To achieve this, the
Heliophysics and Planetary Science communities must delve deeper into
the physics behind the similarities and differences between these
magnetospheric systems. This session aims to make progress on the
topic of comparative magnetospheric system science by identifying
common and distinct mechanisms of non-relativistic plasma that govern
the behavior of planetary magnetospheres such as solar
wind-magnetosphere coupling; magnetotail dynamics; global magnetosphere
mass, momentum, and energy transport; and magnetosphere-ionosphere
coupling. Studies focusing on in-situ spacecraft analysis, remote
sensing observations, and/or theory and modeling are welcome.

We look forward to seeing you at AGU!

AGU SESSION SM027: THREE-DIMENSIONAL MAGNETOSPHERE STRUCTURE AND
DYNAMICS DURING GEOMAGNETIC STORMS

https://agu.confex.com/agu/fm23/prelim.cgi/Session/186496

The AGU Fall Meeting is December 11-15, 2023
Abstract deadline: August 2, 23:59 EST

The Earth's magnetic field and solar wind interplanetary magnetic field
are coupled through the exchange of mass and energy. This coupling
plays out in dramatic fashion during geomagnetic storms, when ground
and space based assets are most susceptible to space weather effects.
Topics in this session include: (1) Magnetospheric structure and
dynamics during geomagnetic storm conditions. (2) Global consequences
of magnetic reconnection during geomagnetic storm conditions. In-situ
space-borne observations and remote/ground-based measurements are
invited covering all regions of Earth's magnetosphere. The goal of this
session is to reveal three-dimensional connections of the dynamic
storm-time magnetosphere through the use of multi-point observations
and global simulations.
