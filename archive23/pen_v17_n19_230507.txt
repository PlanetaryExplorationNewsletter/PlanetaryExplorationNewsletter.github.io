students learn disruptive technologies (Generative AI, 3D printing, 
Data Science, and all things Space related).

We take pride in our collaborative, team-oriented environment with 
colleagues who deeply care about our mission. Metaversity is a fully 
remote company, and like our students, our team is global. We are 
hiring part-time faculty members from a vast range of backgrounds, 
experiences, and perspectives. These are paid positions. 

The role: Teaching five 1-hour classes per week. Classes are at the 
same time each day but each teacher chooses the time, the amount of 
classes you are able to teach each day, and for how many weeks. We 
operate in all time-zones. We have 2 pay scales depending on whether 
you create content or use ours. Classes start June 19.

Required: A Ph.D. in Planetary Science, Astrobiology, Data Science, or 
Satellite Engineering (or related fields).

Bonus qualifications:

1. Fluently speaking a foreign language
2. Prior experience using a VR headset e.g. Oculus (including games)
3. Prior experience teaching 13-18-year-olds (scientific outreach 
   included)

UPDATED GRAM SUITE VERSION 1.5.0 RELEASED

The Global Reference Atmospheric Model (GRAM) Suite is an 
engineering-oriented atmospheric model that estimates mean values and 
statistical variations of atmospheric properties for planetary 
destinations. GRAM outputs include atmospheric density, temperature, 
pressure, winds, and chemical composition along a user-defined path. 

GRAM Suite Version 1.5.0 contains the following updates: the addition 
of SPICE file overrides, a SPICE kernel starter pack, and a topography 
model based on Magellan data to Venus-GRAM, an upgrade of the CSPICE 
toolkit to version N0067, and Earth-GRAM bug fixes. Additionally, the 
Earth-GRAM NCEP data files are now provided in a separate zip bundle to 
enable easier download of the GRAM Suite for non-Earth-GRAM users. 
Additional details regarding GRAM Suite Version 1.5.0 can be found in 
the CRITICAL INFORMATION AND ERRATA file and the GRAM Suite Change Log 
file found in the documentation folder that is included in the GRAM 
Suite distribution files. 

GRAM Suite Version 1.5.0 is available upon request through the NASA 
Software Catalog at: 

https://software.nasa.gov/software/MFS-33888-1  

All current and future GRAM upgrades are only released in the GRAM 
Suite.

SOEST RESEARCH FELLOWSHIP

The School of Ocean and Earth Sciences & Technology is accepting 
applications for the 2023 SOEST Early Career Research Fellowship 
Program at the University of Hawaii at Manoa. Through this position, 
we are seeking early career applicants (completed their PhD within the 
last 5 years) with demonstrated excellence in research and commitment 
to collaboration and inclusivity. These one-year, non-tenurable, 
faculty positions may be renewed for a second year, and will begin in 
2023 or as mutually agreed. This program is designed to allow selectees 
to develop and pursue research and teaching topics upon which they can 
build a future academic career.

SOLAR WIND 16 DEADLINES APPROACHING

Abstract and housing deadlines are approaching for the Solar Wind 16 
meeting (June 12-17, 2023) at Asilomar in California. Please register, 
book, and submit abstracts!

The meeting will be organized around a group of "scene-setting" talks 
which will describe the state-of-the-art in topics of solar wind 
heating and acceleration mechanisms, solar wind sources, transients, 
interaction with planets, and the relationship to broader problems in 
astrophysics. Contributed talks and posters will be organized around 
these scene-setting talks and there will be plenty of time for open 
discussion.

Confirmed scene-setting speakers are Lina Hadid, Matt Kunz, Lorenzo 
Matteini, Merav Opher, Erika Palmerio, Viviane Pierrard, Alexis 
Rouillard, and Yi-Ming Wang. 

In addition, we'll have 'long view' talks from Marcia Neugebauer and 
Russ Howard.

A goal of the meeting is to come away from the week with some consensus 
as the state of the field and ideas about where to go next. The new 
measurements from DKIST, Solar Orbiter, and Parker Solar Probe will 
frame these discussion and make this Solar Wind meeting especially 
timely.

[NASA] ASTROBIOLOGY MISSION IDEATION FACTORY: INDICATION OF INTEREST

The NASA Astrobiology Program has partnered with Knowinnovation (KI) to 
host an Astrobiology Mission Ideation Factory focused on the search for 
life at Mars. NASA would like to provide early career researchers the 
opportunity to develop new concepts for Astrobiology missions. This 
event will be an Ideas Lab-like activity focused on developing 
Astrobiology missions, will provide an enrichment experience for the 
participants, and is intended to be a first step in further development 
of the top ideas. Participants are expected to be early career 
post-docs and graduate students, with an interest in becoming more 
involved in astrobiology-focused space missions. The event is 
tentatively scheduled for a week in August 2023 at the NASA Goddard 
Space Flight Center (GSFC) in Greenbelt, MD. We encourage those with 
an interest in participating to fill out the Indication of Interest 
form at:

[NASA] ADVANCED AIR VEHICLES PROGRAM (AAVP) FELLOWSHIP OPPORTUNITIES 
PRE-PROPOSAL WEBINAR

The first of two pre-proposal teleconferences for the AAVP Fellowship 
Opportunities will be held Monday, May 8, 2023 from 2:00-3:00 PM ET. 
During this session, the AAVP team will give an in-depth overview of 
the AAVP and highlight information contained in the Research 
Opportunities in Aeronautics-2023 (ROA-2023) document regarding 
proposal preparation and requirements. Proposers may also receive 
technical assistance from project staff at this time, including tips 
and guidance for submitting proposals.

The AAVP Funding Opportunities announcement solicits proposals from 
accredited U.S. institutions for research training grants to begin 
the academic year. This Notice of Funding Opportunities (NOFO) is 
designed to support independently-conceived research projects by 
highly qualified graduate students, in disciplines needed to help 
advance NASA's mission, thus affording these students the 
opportunity to directly contribute to advancements in STEM-related 
areas of study. AAVP Fellowship Opportunities are focused on 
innovation and the generation of measurable research results that 
contribute to NASA's current and future science and technology goals. 
For more detail, please go to the AAVP landing page in NSPIRES.

[NASA] ROSES-22: TOPICAL WORKSHOPS, SYMPOSIA, AND CONFERENCES PROPOSAL 
DUE DATE DELAYED TO JULY 21, 2023

Through F.2 Topical Workshops, Symposia, and Conferences (TWSC), the 
Science Mission Directorate (SMD) solicits proposals for events, 
including asynchronous and virtual workshops, etc., that contribute to 
SMD's science, technology and exploration research goals. Proposal 
submission requires designation of at least one reviewing division or 
office. However, proposals that are relevant to more than one division 
are welcome.

This amendment delays the proposal due date for F.2 TWSC to July 21, 
2023. When TWSC-22 closes, this ROSES program element will be replaced 
by a stand-alone TWSC notice of funding opportunity (NOFO). The TWSC 
coordinator seeks comments on the current TWSC-22 text or other 
feedback that may improve the stand-alone TWSC NOFO. Please email TWSC 
comments/feedback by May 31, 2023, to mary.f.sladek@nasa.gov. Feedback 
may or may not be incorporated in the future TWSC NOFO.
