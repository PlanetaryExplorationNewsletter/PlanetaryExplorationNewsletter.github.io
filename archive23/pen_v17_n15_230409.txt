THE PLANETARY SOCIETY, AMERICAN GEOPHYSICAL UNION, AND PROMINENT 
ACADEMIC INSTITUTIONS CALL ON CONGRESS TO SAVE VERITAS MISSION TO VENUS

The Planetary Society is spearheading an effort to save the VERITAS 
mission to Venus, which is facing an indefinite delay due to 
constrained budgets at NASA.

On April 5th, The Planetary Society published a joint letter urging 
Congress to commit NASA to launch VERITAS no later than November 2029. 
The American Geophysical Union, as well as the University of Alaska 
Fairbanks, Tulane University, and Mount Holyoke College, academic 
institutions that have important roles in the mission, also signed the 
letter:

https://www.planetary.org/articles/joint-letter-supporting-veritas

The Planetary Society welcomes additional signatories from other 
organizations that wish to support this important scientific mission. 
Interested organizations should contact Director of Government 
Relations Jack Kiraly at jack.kiraly@planetary.org.

Individuals can take immediate action by writing to their members of 
Congress:

[NASA] SMD: SUPPORT FOR PLANETARY SAMPLE SCIENCE (SPSS) DRAFT 
COOPERATIVE AGREEMENT NOTICE RELEASED FOR COMMENT

Draft CAN Release Date: April 6, 2023
Comments Due: April 20, 2023
Number: NNH23ZDA014J

The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Science 
Mission Directorate (SMD) has released a draft Cooperative Agreement 
Notice (CAN) entitled "Support for Planetary Sample Science (SPSS)" 
for public comment.

The final SPSS CAN will invite the submission of proposals to provide 
support for members of the planetary science community carrying out 
science activities that make use of extraterrestrial samples. 
Scientific studies of such samples have proven valuable for informing 
our understanding of the Solar System. NASA's Planetary Science 
Division (PSD) has long provided support for community research with 
these samples. With this opportunity, NASA seeks to continue to 
provide this support to enable community research.

Prospective investigators from most categories of U.S. organizations 
or institutions will be welcome to respond when the final CAN is 
released.

The draft CAN invites public and community feedback prior to release 
of the final text. Comments/questions regarding this CAN should be 
sent to Stephen.A.Rinehart@nasa.gov no later than April 20, 2023. 
Anonymity of persons/institutions who submit questions/comments will 
be preserved.

[NASA] ROSES-23 AMENDMENT 13: F.18 INNOVATION CORPS (I-CORPS) 
PILOT FINAL TEXT

The NASA Innovation Corps (I-Corps) Pilot (F.18 of ROSES-2023) is 
intended to provide support for participation in the National Science 
Foundation (NSF) Innovation Corps (I-Corps) Program to train faculty, 
students in higher education, post-docs, and other researchers in 
innovation and entrepreneurship skills. The pilot employs education 
through courses to guide teams in the process of developing a business 
model while supporting teams as they explore the commercial potential 
of their research. NASA's Science Mission Directorate and Space 
Technology Mission Directorate are partnering to expand the agency's 
participation by leveraging the infrastructure of NSF's I-Corps 
Program and National Innovation Network.

Proposals may only be submitted by non-profit research institutions 
and institutions of higher education, including community colleges.

ROSES-2023 Amendment 13 releases final text for F.18 I-Corps. Neither 
a Step-1 proposal nor a notice of intent is requested. Proposals may 
be submitted at any time prior to March 29, 2024, after which 
proposers may submit via ROSES-2024.

Questions concerning F.18 I-Corps may be directed to Maggie Yancey at 
margaret.a.yancey@nasa.gov.

FLUVIAL AEOLIAN INTERACTIONS ON PLANETARY SURFACES WORKSHOP (FAIRPLAY)

We invite you to the first Fluvial Aeolian InteRactions on PLAnetarY 
surfaces workshop (FAIRPLAY) on the 1st - 3rd November 2023 at the 
European Space Research and Technology Centre (ESTEC), European Space 
Agency (ESA), Noordwijk, Netherlands.

The FAIRPLAY workshop aims to promote synergy between different 
scientific communities directly or indirectly involved in researching 
aeolian-fluvial interactions on planetary surfaces. This workshop is 
organised by the Working group on Aeolian-Fluvial Terrain Interactions 
(WAFTI), established at the European Space Agency (ESA).

The workshop is a hybrid event with space for 100 in-person attendees 
and focuses on aeolian-fluvial interactions on Earth, Mars and Titan, 
in the following subject areas:

- The influence of aeolian transport on fluvial morphodynamics and 
  vice versa
- Sediment transport, sediment budgets and bedform dynamics
- Sedimentology
- Coupling between atmospheric and surface processes
- Remote sensing and in situ measurements
- Planetary analogues
- Implication for past or present habitable environments on other 
  planets
- The potential for future exploration and investigation of planetary 
  surfaces

Registration and abstract submission will open in June 2023 and will 
be free of charge.
