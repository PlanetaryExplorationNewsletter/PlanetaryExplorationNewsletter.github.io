[NASA] ROSES-22 AMENDMENT 89: F.5 FINESST GRADUATE STUDENT RESEARCH 
PROPOSAL DUE DATE DELAY

Future Investigators in NASA Earth and Space Science and Technology 
(FINESST F.5) solicits proposals from accredited U.S. universities and 
other eligible organizations for graduate student-designed and 
performed research projects that contribute to the Science Mission 
Directorate's (SMD) science, technology, and exploration goals. The 
graduate student shall have the primary initiative to define the 
proposed FINESST research project and must be the primary author, with 
input or supervision from the proposal's Principal Investigator (PI) 
or mentor, as appropriate. The proposal must present a well-defined 
research problem/activity and a justification of its scientific 
significance to NASA. FINESST awards are research grants for up to 
three years and up to $50K per year.

ROSES-2022 Amendment 89 delays the due date for FINESST proposals. 
Proposals are due February 21, 2023.

On or about February 14, 2023, this Amendment to the NASA Research 
Announcement "Research Opportunities in Space and Earth Sciences 
(ROSES) 2022" (NNH22ZDA001N) will be posted on the NASA research 
opportunity homepage at:

[NASA] ROSES-23 AMENDMENT 1: FINAL TEXT AND DUE DATES FOR B.7 SPACE 
WEATHER SCIENCE APPLICATION RESEARCH-TO-OPERATIONS-TO-RESEARCH

The primary goal of any proposal to B.7 Space Weather Science 
Application Research-to-Operations-to-Research (SWR2O2R) must be to 
support research to improve application-oriented models and forecast 
tools that directly enable advances in the areas described below and, 
in doing so, could also lead to improved scientific understanding. 
Proposed work must have a clear path forward to benefit an identified 
end user (e.g., operational agencies or an industry with a 
well-established space weather need) and must establish both the value 
of the proposed work to the end user as well as the viability of 
delivering a usable capability within the lifetime of the R2O2R award. 
The single application-oriented focus area for this opportunity is 
Data Assimilation for Neutral Density Forecasting. In addition to this 
single focus area, SWR2O2R also invites submissions on any subject 
that is of demonstrable relevance to the program.

ROSES-2023 Amendment 1 releases final text and due dates for B.7 
SWR2O2R. Step-1 proposals are due April 6, 2023 and Step-2 proposals 
are due June 7, 2023.

POSTDOC IN EXPERIMENTAL ICY MOONS GEOCHEMISTRY, OPEN UNIVERSITY, UK

This is an opportunity to build new understanding of the geochemistry 
of the ice shell on Jupiter's moon Europa, using ultra-low-temperature 
experiments and cutting-edge cryo-analytical techniques.

You will use an experimental approach to explore the formation of 
salt-rich ices generated by dynamic processes such as brine-and-ice 
volcanism, building a comprehensive picture of their potential 
diversity and relationship to the subsurface ocean. You will combine 
cryogenic laboratory experiments with analytical tools to investigate 
composition and structure of ices delivered to Europa's surface, 
informing observations by upcoming missions such as the Jupiter ICy 
moons Explorer (JUICE) and Europa Clipper. You will be welcomed into 
the Open University's vibrant planetary science and astrobiology 
research communities, joining an interdisciplinary team investigating 
the potential for life beyond Earth.

Closing date for applications: 8 March
