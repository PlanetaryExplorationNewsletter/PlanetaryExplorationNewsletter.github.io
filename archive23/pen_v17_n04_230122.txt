JOB OPENING: POSTDOC IN MARS MINERALOGY/STRATIGRAPHY AT UT AUSTIN

The UT Austin Planetary Surface Processes Group, headed by Dr. Tim 
Goudge, is advertising an opening for a Postdoctoral Fellow. This 
position will focus on research that integrates orbital spectroscopic 
and image/topographic data of Mars to understand the formation of clay 
mineral-bearing strata. The available funding also provides room for

The position will have an annual salary of $65,000 (plus benefits), as 
well as $3000 in relocation funds, and $1500 per year for travel to a 
professional conference.

Dr. Goudge is committed to building an inclusive research group with 
members that have a diverse set of perspectives and backgrounds. 
Applicants from historically underrepresented groups in STEM fields, 
with non-traditional backgrounds, and/or with a demonstrated interest 
in efforts to improve equity and inclusion in STEM are especially 
encouraged to apply.

The application deadline for full consideration is Feb. 15, 2023, and

UNIVERSITY

https://careers.wesleyan.edu/postings/9388

Prof. Martha Gilmore seeks a Postdoctoral Research Associate with 
expertise in mineralogy, petrology and/or geochemistry to undertake 
analysis of Venus relevant minerals and rocks to constrain weathering 
reactions on the Venus surface. We will examine chemical and 
mineralogical changes in relevant geological samples exposed to Venus 
conditions in the Glenn Extreme Environments Rig (GEER). Analytical 
techniques include FE-SEM, XRF, XRD, Electron Microprobe, VNIR and 
Raman spectroscopy. The work will also include the design, execution 
and analysis of experiments in 1-atm apparatus to mimic Venus surface 
conditions in the lab at Wesleyan.

The position has been approved for 3 years. Anticipated start date is 
no earlier than July 1, 2023. Applications will be considered on a 
rolling basis. Applications received by March 24, 2023 will be given 
full consideration.

POSTDOCTORAL SCHOLAR POSITION IN ASTEROID AND COMET DYNAMICS AND 
PROPERTIES AT CALTECH

We invite applications for talented researchers who will work with Dr. 
Joseph Masiero, Deputy PI of the NEOWISE mission, to study the 
physical and dynamical properties of asteroids and comets using data 
from the NEOWISE survey, both as individual objects and as an ensemble 
population. NEOWISE has been surveying the sky continuously since 2013 
and has amassed over 1.3 million thermal infrared measurements of 
small bodies in the Solar System. The data and results from NEOWISE 
studies are also being used to support the development of the upcoming 
NEO Surveyor mission. IPAC serves as the WISE/NEOWISE Science Data 
Center and hosts the mission data archive, and will serve the same 
role for NEO Surveyor. 

To apply, please submit a CV, Research Statement, and contact 
information for three professional references to 
applications@ipac.caltech.edu. Applications received by February 28, 
2023 will receive full consideration, but review of applications will 
continue until a suitable candidate has been identified. For 
questions, please contact Dr. Joseph Masiero at 
jmasiero@ipac.caltech.edu.

[NASA] ENGAGEMENT OPPORTUNITIES IN NASA STEM 2023 APPENDIX 10: 
MINORITY UNIVERSITY RESEARCH AND EDUCATION PROJECT WOMEN'S COLLEGES 
AND UNIVERSITIES (MUREP WCU)

NASA MUREP Women's Colleges and Universities Activity is a new 
initiative seeking to address the significant gender gap and disparate 
experiences of women in STEM in the United States, both in higher 
education and the workforce. MUREP WCU contributes to NASA's goals and 
priorities for STEM engagement by inspiring, training, and equipping 
women undergraduate and graduate students from groups traditionally 
underrepresented and underserved in STEM fields with the motivation, 
knowledge, and skills needed for success in undergraduate and graduate 
STEM degree programs and afterward in STEM careers.

Successful MUREP WCU proposals will be funded as multi-year 
cooperative agreements with a three-year period of performance, and 
the opportunity to extend for two additional years. Please see the 
full Appendix 10: MUREP WCU for more details. 

Optional pre-proposal webinars for the MUREP WCU opportunity will be 
held on:

Friday, February 10, 2023 at 12:30PM Eastern Time
Wednesday, March 8, 2023 at 3:00pm Eastern Time

Full Proposals due at 5:00pm Eastern Time on Monday, April 17, 2023

For general inquiries, please contact: MUREPWCU@nasaprs.com.

LOOKING FOR SCIENTISTS TO WORK WITH COMMUNITY COLLEGE ASTRONOMY 
INSTRUCTORS

The NASA Community College Network (NCCN) is looking for scientists 
who would like to work with astronomy instructors to help expand and 
improve the teaching of space science in our nation's community 
colleges. Scientists should have some NASA connection, but this does 
not require you to be on NASA's payroll, but merely to use NASA 
instruments or data in your work. 

Scientists will be partnered with instructors and can help in a 
variety of ways: present your research or developments in your field 
to one or more classes, help an instructor to update their class 
lectures or labs, assist students with projects, develop or share 
nontechnical audio-visual aids, answer student questions via email or 
Zoom, etc. 

You get to decide when, how, and how much you participate. For more 
information about the project, see:

https://nccn.seti.org/

Once you are registered, you will also have access to over a hundred 
educational resources that have been vetted to be especially useful 
for teaching non-science majors.

2023 INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE OF DEEP SPACE SCIENCES

The conference is one of the activities conducted during the 2023 
Space Day of China, to be held in Hefei, the capital city of Anhui 
Province, from 24 to 30 April 2023. It is jointly organized by Deep 
Space Exploration Laboratory (DSEL) and University of Science and 
Technology of China (USTC).

China will carry out more deep space exploration missions in the next 
10 to 15 years. The fourth stage of its lunar exploration program has 
been approved, including Chang'e-6, Chang'e-7, and Chang'e-8. The next 
step of the planetary exploration program is also scheduled, including 
Tianwen-2 for asteroid sample return, Tianwen-3 for Mars sample 
return, and Tianwen-4 for Jupiter system exploration. Besides, other 
spacecraft and telescope missions are also planned.

The International Conference of Deep Space Sciences aims to bring 
scientists worldwide to discuss new developments in deep space 
sciences. On behalf of the Organizing Committee, we feel deeply 
honored to invite you to submit abstracts. New session proposals are 
also welcome (Please contact kjiang@ustc.edu.cn).

PDS USER EXPERIENCE TESTERS NEEDED

The NASA Planetary Data System (PDS) needs your input! The PDS is in 
the process of modernizing the User Experience and Interface Design of 
the overall PDS web experience. Over the next couple years, we will be 
looking for your feedback on our new designs and for beta testing some 
of our efforts, with the first iteration of this underway throughout 
the first quarter of 2023 (January-March). If you have 30-45 minutes 
to spare, our design team will walk you through the updated PDS and 
gather your input to ensure that we will meet your expectations and 
needs as the new site and tools evolve. Your information will be kept 
confidential as an evaluation participant. If interested in 
participating, please contact the PDS Help Desk 
(pds-operator@jpl.nasa.gov) or Mike Newcomb (mpnewcom@jpl.nasa.gov) 
for more information.

Planetary data enthusiasts of all backgrounds and experience levels 
welcome!

TITAN THROUGH TIME MEETING: FIRST ANNOUNCEMENT AND DATE POLL

Dear Titan fans,
 
We are very honored and delighted to host the 2023 iteration of the 
"Titan Though Time" meeting in Paris.

For those how are now familiar with the meeting, this is a 
continuation of a highly successful meeting series on Titan 
fundamental science begun in 2010 at GSFC. The Titan Through Time 
meeting has been an important venue for the research community to 
exchange research results and ideas about the highly 
multi-disciplinary science of the Titan System.

Among all the important decisions we have to make and the subsequent 
information that we will communicate, the choice of a date is the very 
first to make. The decision has to be taken quite rapidly.

We propose a poll here, to be filled out by the very beginning of 
February (earlier would be much appreciated):

https://doodle.com/meeting/participate/id/aA6Pvmjb

The doodle poll will be open for three weeks counting from today 
before closing. Please keep in mind that the workshop is supposed to 
last 3 full days.

Eager to seeing you all in Paris for the meeting.

Sebastien Rodriguez, on behalf of the Paris Titan Through Time meeting
