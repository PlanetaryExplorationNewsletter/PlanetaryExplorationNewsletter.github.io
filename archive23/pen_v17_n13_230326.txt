EDITORIAL: CONGRESS NEEDS TO INTERVENE IN THE MANAGEMENT OF NASA 
PLANETARY SCIENCE

Threats to New Horizons, VERITAS, NEO Surveyor, and other missions
due to managerial missteps by the Biden administration need to be 
addressed by Congress.

CALL TO ACTION: PETITION CONGRESS FOR 2029 LAUNCH DATE FOR VERITAS

The VERITAS team needs your help. NASA selected VERITAS in June 2021 
and then put the mission on hold this past November despite us being 
on time and on budget. Now we are scheduled to launch "no earlier than 
2031". 

To maintain our schedule as much as possible, we are working to 
petition Congress to stipulate a 2029 launch date for VERITAS. If you 
are willing and able, please read and sign the petition to our elected 
officials:

https://secure.planetary.org/site/SPageServer?pagename=/actioncenter#/35

We realize that many are unable to participate in this petition given 
your affiliations, but please share this with any U.S. friends and 
amily you may have who are able to do so. 

If you would like more information about the situation VERITAS finds 
itself in, please feel free to reach out to me or anyone else on the 
VERTIAS team. 

Thank you for your support, 

Jenny Whitten 
she/her 
Associate Deputy PI of VERITAS

TITAN THROUGH TIME MEETING #6 UPDATE

The website for the next Titan Through Time meeting in Paris is now 
officially online, as well as the opportunity to register and submit an 
abstract. Go to:

https://sites.google.com/view/titanthroughtimeparis2023/home

You will find information on the location of the meeting, a few first 
hints for the logistics, and a dedicated page for registration and 
contribution submission (oral or poster). The meeting will be 
full-hybrid, but only remote oral presentation will be available.

The deadline for registration and abstract submission is fixed on 
April 15. The program will soon follow.

Please keep tuned on the website as we will continue on populating it 
with new information on a regular basis.

We are sincerely looking forward seeing you all in Paris next June.

JOB OPPORTUNITY: SOFTWARE ENGINEER III FOR SMALL-BODY EPHEMERIS 
DEVELOPMENT AT THE JET PROPULSION LABORATORY

JPL's Solar System Dynamics (SSD: ssd.jpl.nasa.gov) and Center for 
Near-Earth Object Studies (CNEOS: cneos.jpl.nasa.gov) are looking for 
an experienced IT professional interested in supporting our mission of 
providing high-quality orbital data for Solar-System objects. More

WORKSHOP ON IMPACT PROCESSES AS A PATH TO HABITABILITY ON PLANETARY 
BODIES

This workshop will be held in Campinas, Brazil, on June 26-28, 2023. 
Sponsorship for the meeting has been provided by FAPESP (Sao Paulo 
Research Foundation) and Unicamp (State University of Campinas), that 
will allow the registration to be free of charge. The workshop will be 
by invitation only, so please email the main organizer, Alvaro Crosta 
(crosta@unicamp.br), if you would like to be invited, and include the 
topic of your contribution. There will be an optional field trip 
(June 29-July 3) to visit two impact structures in southern Brazil, 
Vargeao and Vista Alegre.

Scope of workshop: Large cosmic impacts are among the key geological 
processes potentially leading to the establishment of habitable 
conditions in planetary bodies. This meeting is intended to discuss 
recent advances in understanding the role of impacts in creating 
potential life-harboring environments in icy and rocky planetary 
bodies, with a special focus on icy moons such as Titan and Europa.

[NASA] ROSES-23: NEW OPPORTUNITY C.24 "HERE TO OBSERVE" PROGRAM FOR 
NASA'S PLANETARY SCIENCE DIVISION

C.24 Here to Observe (H2O) solicits proposals from non-R1 institutions 
for undergraduate students to observe NASA Planetary Science Division 
(PSD) mission meetings/activities alongside mentors and peers. By 
opening doors to PSD missions and sharing the excitement of planetary 
exploration, H2O's goal is to spark and maintain an interest for 
underrepresented students considering STEM careers. Proposing 
institutions are expected to accommodate core, NASA-led program 
activities (such as workshops, seminars and field trips) and describe 
other proposed supplemental activities that will be finalized in a 
co-creation period with participating PSD missions. Additionally, NASA 
will provide optional, self-guided educational packages that introduce 
participating students to Solar System science/exploration and NASA 
systems engineering. Participation is limited to undergraduates and 
faculty from U.S.-based institutions and to U.S. citizens and green 
card holders to ensure NASA compliance with ITAR and EAR rules as 
export-controlled materials could be presented in PSD mission meetings.

This program element does not have a proposal due date, proposals may 
be submitted at any time. Go to:

https://solicitation.nasaprs.com/ROSES2023

Questions concerning C.24 H2O may be directed to David J. Smith at

Release of the draft AO: January 10, 2023 (actual)
Estimated Release of final AO: November 2023 (target)
Estimated Proposal due date: March 2024 (target)

NASA has assessed the availability and readiness of RPS technologies 
for the NF5 AO. Based on this assessment, NASA has made the following 
decisions to provide the lowest risk to proposers:

   Thermoelectric Generator (MMRTG) units for proposals requiring 
   radioisotope electrical power for spacecraft.

* The NF5 AO will offer up to twenty fueled radioisotope heater units 
  (RHUs) for proposals requiring thermal heating for specific 
  spacecraft components.

NEOWISE 2023 DATA RELEASE

The Near-Earth Object Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (NEOWISE) and 
IPAC at the California Institute of Technology announce the NEOWISE 
2023 Data Release.

The 2023 Release includes data acquired during the ninth year of the 
NEOWISE Reactivation mission (Mainzer et al. 2014, ApJ, 792, 30), 
13 December 2021 to 13 December 2022. These data are combined with 
those from Years 1-8 into a single archive that contains ~22.9 million 
sets of 3.4 and 4.6 micron images and a database of ~171 billion source 
detections. 

NEOWISE scanned the sky ~18 times during the first nine years of survey 
operations, with approximately six months between survey passes. With 
twelve or more independent exposures are made on each sky position 
during each epoch, the NEOWISE archive is a time-domain resource for 
extracting multiple, independent thermal flux and position measurements 
of Solar System small bodies and background galactic and extragalactic 
sources.

A guide to the NEOWISE data release, data access instructions, and 
supporting documentation is available at:

https://wise2.ipac.caltech.edu/docs/release/neowise/

NEOWISE is a joint project of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory/California 
Institute of Technology and the University of Arizona, funded by the 
National Aeronautics and Space Administration Planetary Science 
Division.

CULTURALLY INCLUSIVE PLANETARY ENGAGEMENT WORKSHOPS

Conducted by the NASA SMD Science Activation Planetary Resources and 
Content Heroes (ReaCH) project.

Planetary scientists and astrobiologists (including graduate students, 
post-doctoral researchers, engineers and technicians) and informal 
(out-of-school time) educators are invited to apply to attend a 2023 
Culturally Inclusive Planetary Engagement professional development 
workshop: 

https://www.lpi.usra.edu/planetary-reach/workshops/

During the workshops, scientists and educators are paired together and 
supported in bi-directional conversations around diversity and 
inclusion in engaging Black and Latinx audiences in planetary science. 
Participants also lead hands-on activities during a co-designed public 
engagement event following the workshop held in collaboration with a 
local youth-serving organization. The event allows workshop 
participants the opportunity to practice engagement strategies 
discussed in the workshop.

Confirmed 2023 workshop locations and dates:

New Orleans, LA (Tulane University; June 8-10)
Mountain View, CA (SETI Institute; June 22-24)
Miami, FL (Perez Art Museum Miami; August 17-19)

Space in each workshop is limited to 10 planetary 
scientists/astrobiologists and 10 informal educators. Stipends are 
available for participants able to accept them.
