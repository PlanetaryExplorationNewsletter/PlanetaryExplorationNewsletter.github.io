TWO LECTURER/ASSISTANT LECTURER TENURE TRACK POSITIONS IN PLANETARY
ATMOSPHERE MODELLING AND PLANETARY SCIENCES

Division of Space Research and Planetary Sciences, University of Bern,
Switzerland

The Division of Space Research and Planetary Sciences of the University
of Bern has two openings, as per 1.1.2024, for a Lecturer / Assistant
Lecturer Tenure Track in planetary atmosphere modelling and a Lecturer
/ Assistant Lecturer Tenure Track in planetary sciences. The division
is one of the leading research groups in Europe in the fields of
theoretical and experimental planetology and is looking for two
candidates in a) planetary atmosphere and radiation transport
modelling, with particular interests in theoretical models of planetary
atmospheric structures, the computation of relevant spectroscopic
observables, and the comparison of models with observations. b) in any
field of planetary sciences broadly defined, including fields like the
study of properties of planets and minor bodies in the Solar System,
planetary evolution, habitability, planetary system dynamics,
comparative (exo)planetology, observations and physico-chemical models
of planet-forming disks, etc. Applicants using theoretical,
experimental, and observational approaches for both Solar System
bodies and exoplanets are welcome. A potential subsequent promotion to
associate professor is subject to fulfillment of qualification
criteria.

The application deadline is 15 August 2023. More information can be

PHD POSITION AT AIX-MARSEILLE UNIVERSITY, FRANCE

This position is in the experimental study of surface processes of
Europa under particle bombardment.

In the context of the collaborative project "linking cryovolcanism to
space weathering on the surface of Europa" between CNRS and University
of Arizona, we propose a PhD position based at the PIIM laboratory,
member of the Origins Institute of Marseille, France, with a start
date no later than December 2023. This project is built around an
experimental approach - irradiating icy analogs of Europa's surface in
a vacuum chamber - to determine how radiolytic processes evolve the
surface from a physico-chemical point of view and how the nature of
the ice (composition and structure) influences this evolution. The
recruited person will work on the evolution of the experimental plan,
the execution of experiments, and the interpretation of resulting data.
They will develop the skills necessary to operate the Ultra-High Vacuum
apparatus, as well as perform analysis with infrared spectroscopy, gas
chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC-MS), and Ultra-High Resolution
mass spectrometry. A Master's degree or equivalent is required, with a
background in analytical chemistry/and or physical chemistry. Full

POSTDOC POSITION IN EXOPLANET ATMOSPHERES

The Space Research Institute (IWF) of the Austrian Academy of Sciences
(OeAW) is offering a postdoc position in exoplanet atmospheres - links
to observations. The successful candidate will join the IWF research
group "Exoplanets: Weather & Climate" led by Prof. Christiane Helling
as part of the OeAW's efforts to expand the theme of exoplanet
research at the IWF in Graz, Austria. The candidate is expected to
contribute by linking complex modelling results to observations and by
doing scientific data interpretation and preparation for PLATO, Ariel,
and other future missions.

The applicant must hold a PhD in the relevant fields of astrophysics.
The appointment begins as early as November 1, 2023 and will be for
three years.

Applications must include (1) CV, (2) publication list, (3) research
experience statement (max 2 pages) and research plan (max 1 page),
(4) academic certificates, and (5) two references letters. Please send
the application as one PDF file, mentioning Job ID: IWF051PD123 to
Cosima Muck, cosima.muck@oeaw.ac.at, no later than July 20, 2023.
