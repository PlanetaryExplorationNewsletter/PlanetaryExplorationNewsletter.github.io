PHD STUDENT IN EXPERIMENTAL ASTEROID RESEARCH

Lulea University of Technology (LTU) is looking for a highly-motivated
PhD student to join the Asteroid Engineering Laboratory located on the
Space Campus in Kiruna, Sweden.

The successful candidate will carry out laboratory experiments on
asteroid simulants and meteorites with the ultimate goal to understand
the mechanisms that destroy asteroids close to the Sun, and how the
destruction process affects the near-Earth asteroid population. The
primary tool for the experimental work is the new Space and
High-Irradiation Near-Sun Simulator (SHINeS), which is used for
assessing how irradiation comparable to that found close to the Sun
affects materials resembling those found on asteroids. The successful
candidate will also contribute to the development of an analytical
and/or numerical model of the destruction process that will be
included in evolutionary models of the near-Earth asteroid population.

The position is fully funded for 4 years.

The application deadline is June 26, 2023 CEST.

[NASA] TOWN HALL FOR PLANETARY SCIENCE RESEARCH PROGRAMS USING
DUAL-ANONYMOUS PEER REVIEW
 
On June 29, 2023 at 3 PM Eastern, NASA's Planetary Science Division
(PSD) will host a webinar to discuss the Dual-Anonymous Peer Review
(DAPR) process for research programs in the PSD under ROSES-2023,
including all of the Data Analysis Programs (DAPs; Cassini, Discovery,
Lunar, Mars, and New Frontiers DAPs), Exoplanet Research Program
(XRP), Habitable Worlds, all Participating Scientist Programs, and the
Planetary Protection Research Program, which will be DAPR for the
first time.
 
In DAPR, not only are proposers unaware of the identity of reviewers,
but the reviewers do not have explicit knowledge of the proposing
teams and institutions during the scientific evaluation of the
proposal. The webinar will: (1) discuss the motivation for
dual-anonymous peer review and how SMD has used it to date,
(2) describe how to be compliant with dual-anonymous peer review, and
(3) explain how dual-anonymous peer reviews will work. We will also
focus on specific examples relative to the programs in PSD using DAPR.
 
In advance of the webinar, questions may be submitted and upvoted:

ENDURANCE SCIENCE WORKSHOP 2023

August 9-11, 2023
Caltech (Pasadena, CA) and Virtual

The Planetary Science and Astrobiology Decadal Survey recommended
Endurance - a lunar South Pole-Aitken basin traverse and sample return
rover - as the highest priority mission for NASA's Lunar Discovery and
Exploration Program. It's an exciting concept and has the potential to
do transformative science in the coming decade. NASA has taken this
recommendation seriously and is exploring options for implementing
Endurance. Because of this, now is the ideal time to have an open,
public workshop to further articulate the science case, engage the
broader community, and document information that could feed forward
into future concept studies and science definition activities.

More information can be found here:

https://www.hou.usra.edu/meetings/endurance2023

Abstract submissions will open soon, and one-page abstracts will be
due in approximately 1 month. Feel free to reach out to the organizing
committee if you have questions.

Workshop organizing committee: James Tuttle Keane, Barbara Cohen, Ben
Greenhagen, Brad Jolliff, Carolyn Crow, Chip Shearer, Sarah Valencia,
Sonia Tikoo, Yang Liu.

[NASA] ROSES-23: B.7 SPACE WEATHER SCIENCE APPLICATION RESEARCH-TO-
OPERATIONS-TO-RESEARCH STEP-2 PROPOSAL DUE DATE DELAY

B.7 Space Weather Science Application Research-to-Operations-to-
Research (SWR2O2R) solicits proposals to improve application-oriented
models and forecast tools that directly enable advances in the areas
described below and, in doing so, could also lead to improved
scientific understanding. Proposed work must have a clear path forward
to benefit an identified end user (e.g., operational agencies or an
industry with a well-established space weather need) and must
establish both the value of the proposed work to the end user as well
as the viability of delivering a usable capability within the lifetime
of the R2O2R award. The single application-oriented focus area for
this opportunity is Data Assimilation for Neutral Density Forecasting.
In addition to this single focus area, SWR2O2R also invites
submissions on any subject that is of demonstrable relevance to the
program.

ROSES-2023 Amendment 28 delays the Step-2 proposal due date for B.7
SWR2O2R to July 19, 2023 and changes the point of contact to Genene
Fisher.

Questions concerning B.7 SWR2O2R or this amendment may be directed to
the new point of contact: Genene Fisher at genene.fisher@nasa.gov.
