PLANET CHARACTERIZATION IN THE SOLAR SYSTEM AND THE GALAXY 2024 

The Planet Characterization in the Solar System and the Galaxy 2024 
meeting will be held February 21-23, 2024, at LPI in Houston. We are 
looking for 6-8 members to join the program committee to help assemble 
the program schedule, invited speakers, and submitted abstracts for 
talks and posters. Diverse representation is desired, including a 
combination of experts in Solar System planets and exoplanets. If you 
are interested in serving on the program committee, please email Kirby 
Runyon at krunyon@psi.edu with your indication of interest by Friday, 
March 10, 2023 with "Planet Characterization" in the subject line. 
More information is at: 

https://www.hou.usra.edu/meetings/planetcharacterization2024/ 

Please share this with students, postdocs, and others you may know who 
could be interested.

ESA ARCHIVAL RESEARCH VISITOR PROGRAMME

To increase the scientific return from its space science missions, the 
European Space Agency (ESA) welcomes applications from scientists 
interested in pursuing research projects based on data publicly 
available in the ESA Space Science Archives.

The ESA Archival Research Visitor Programme is open to scientists, at 
all career levels, affiliated with institutes in ESA Member States and 
Collaborating States. Early-career scientists, including PhD students, 
are particularly encouraged to apply.

During their stay, visiting scientists will have access to archives and 
mission specialists for help with the retrieval, calibration, and 
analysis of archival data. In principle, all areas of space research 
covered by ESA science missions can be supported.

Residence lasts typically between one and three months, also 
distributed over multiple visits. Research projects can be carried out 
at ESAC (Madrid, Spain) and at ESTEC (Noordwijk, Netherlands). To 
offset the expenses incurred by visitors, ESA covers travel costs and 
provides support for lodging expenses and meals.

Applications received before 1 May 2023 will be considered for visits 
in autumn 2023 and winter 2024.

For further details, including areas of research and contact 
information, please write to arvp@cosmos.esa.int or refer to:

POSTDOC POSITION SEARCHING FOR ASTEROID BINARIES IN GAIA DATA AT OCA IN 
NICE, FRANCE

The GaiaMoons research project, supported by the French national 
research agency ANR, started on 1 Dec 2022 and aims at detecting and 
characterising asteroid satellites by exploiting the ultra-accurate 
astrometry obtained by the Gaia mission of the European Space Agency.
At the level of accuracy of Gaia, astrometric discovery of satellites 
can become an efficient technique, potentially exploring ranges of 
sizes and separations that remain difficult to access from the ground. 
Satellites discovered by astrometry should be validated and 
characterised through other techniques, including photometry and 
stellar occultations. Fully characterised systems can give access to 
fundamental asteroid properties such as density and shapes.

This position is for three years and focused on exploiting astrometry 
from Gaia DR3 (published in June 2023), the forthcoming Focused Data 
Release (FDR, end of 2023) and DR4. Go to:

LEAG CLOC-SAT REPORT

LEAG's Continuous Lunar Orbital Capabilities Specific Action Team 
(CLOC-SAT) Final Report is now available on the LEAG website: 

https://www.lpi.usra.edu/leag 

The Report addresses measurements, technologies, and architectures that 
will enable NASA's science and exploration objectives for the next 
decade and beyond. In addition, two key tables are also available 
online in Excel format. 

The CLOC-SAT team thanks the community for their involvement in this 
effort and SSERVI (especially Jennifer Baer) for helping produce the 
Final Report. The team sincerely hopes that this document is useful to 
all stakeholders in lunar orbital capabilities immediately and well 
into the future. 

I also want to extend my gratitude to Drs. Carle Pieters, Ben 
Greenhagen and the rest of the team (Drs. Tim Glotch, Lauren Jozwiak, 
John Keller, Paul Lucey, Mark Robinson, Angela Stickle, Julie Stopar, 
James Tuttle Keane & ex-officios Drs. Amy Fagan, Kelsey Young, Brett 
Denevi, Ben Bussey, and Jose Hurtado) for their extended work. This 
was not a small undertaking and I know that everyone's time is very 
valuable. Please join me in thanking the entire team!

ANCIENT AND FUTURE BRINES ABSTRACT DEADLINE EXTENDED TO MARCH 10, 2023

The Ancient and Future Brines hybrid conference will be held in Reno,
Nevada, from May 15-18, 2023, with an optional field trip on May 19. 
This is the final conference of the Brines Across the Solar System 
series. Abstracts will be due March 10, 2023 (5PM CST). Go to:

https://www.hou.usra.edu/meetings/ancientfuturebrines2023

This conference will focus on understanding:

1. The formation, location, and potential habitability of ancient 
   brines on early planetary bodies
2. The role of ancient brines in the origins of life and habitable 
   environments
3. The technology involved in the detection and characterization of 
   brines on planetary bodies (both in situ and in returned samples)
4. The technology involved in mitigating brines in the detection and 
   characterization of biosignatures
5. The role and impact of brine systems for In Situ Resource 
   Utilization

The optional field trip will be at a brines location (finalizing 
locations, more information coming soon) and will have a connection to 
technology development and instruments for detecting brines on Earth 
and elsewhere, including having instrumentation demonstrations.

MARS RECONNAISSANCE ORBITER: SIXTEEN YEARS OBSERVING A CHANGING MARS

For 16 years, the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO) has used its three 
cameras, multi-spectral imaging spectrometer, shallow radar, and 
atmospheric sounder to observe the surface, subsurface, and atmosphere 
of Mars at unprecedented spatial resolution and with expanded coverage 
in space and time. Over time, these observing capabilities have changed 
in response both to the technical changes inherent in a long-lived 
deep-space mission and to operational planning changes in response to 
what the MRO observations were telling us about the planet itself. For 
instance, although designed to "follow the water" of an ancient Mars 
climate, the very high spatial resolution imaging and growing timeline 
of observations has enabled MRO to reveal unprecedented changes 
occurring on the planet today. A special upcoming issue of Icarus 
will give an overview of the evolving capabilities of MRO and its 
investigations, its key findings, and evolving strategies. It will 
also include latest findings, together with plans for the ongoing 
exploration of Mars by MRO.
