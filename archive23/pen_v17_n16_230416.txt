BILL FELDMAN SCIENCE SYMPOSIUM 2.0

This symposium was cancelled due to COVID in 2020. We are pleased to 
announce its return for August 31 - September 1, 2023, in Los Alamos, 
NM.

Bill Feldman's friends and colleagues plan to honor him with a 
symposium of talks covering the wide variety of scientific disciplines 
to which he has made significant contributions. These include: 
spaceflight instrument development; solar and magnetospheric physics; 
planetary nuclear spectroscopy; lunar, Mars, Mercury, and asteroid 
science; and fundamental physics (e.g., neutron lifetime). 

Invited and contributed talks will include both a review of the 
contributions made by Bill and/or a discussion of the current state 
of the fields. All are invited to attend and participate in 
invigorating and enjoyable scientific discussions. 

Los Alamos National Laboratory is hosting the symposium. A 
dinner/banquet will be held on the evening of August 31.

Please indicate your interest either in attending and/or giving a talk 
to Sarah Balkey (slbalkey@lanl.gov), and copy David Lawrence 
(David.J.Lawrence@jhuapl.edu) and Katherine Mesick (kmesick@lanl.gov). 
If you have already done so, you will be contacted soon with more 
details.

ASTROBIOLOGY SCICOMM GUILD APRIL 2023 MEETING: CULTURALLY INCLUSIVE 
PLANETARY ENGAGEMENT WORKSHOPS

The Astrobiology SciComm Guild is an initiative of the NASA 
Astrobiology Program office. Our mission is to support the astrobiology 
community as evolving science communicators, by leveraging SciComm and 
professional development opportunities for members while serving DEIA 
ideals. We bring members diverse SciComm opportunities with NASA and 
external partners. Our next virtual meeting will be on April 24 at 
12 pm Pacific / 3 pm Eastern. We'll have guest speakers from Planetary 
ReaCH (Resources and Content Heroes), part of NASA's Science 
Activation program, to discuss our first professional development 
opportunity for members: a series of workshops for planetary scientists 
and astrobiologists on inclusive planetary engagement, focusing on 
black and Latinx communities. If interested in attending this or 
future meetings, first, become a member of the Guild, if you are not 
already one (by contacting svetlana.shkolyar@nasa.gov), and then 
register to receive connection details plus additional information

HABITABLE WORLDS OBSERVATORY SCIENCE, TECHNOLOGY, ARCHITECTURE REVIEW 
TEAM AND VIRTUAL TOWN HALL

NASA is creating a Science, Technology, Architecture Review Team 
(START) to determine the science scope and needed observatory 
capabilities for the Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO). HWO was 
prioritized by the 2020 Astrophysics Decadal Survey and is slated to be 
the NASA Astrophysics flagship mission that will follow the Nancy Grace 
Roman Space Telescope. HWO will directly image and characterize 
exoplanets in the ultraviolet-visible-near infrared wavelength range. 
Go to:   

https://science.nasa.gov/astrophysics/programs/gomap

We are soliciting self-nominations for people to serve on the START. We 
want START to be composed of people from diverse backgrounds and 
disciplinary perspectives, and encourage scientists, engineers, and 
technologists with terminal degrees in their field to self-nominate.

For more information on the START self-nomination process, duties of 
START and its relationship to other activities please see:

NASA will host a Virtual Town Hall meeting on Friday, May 5, 2023, 
11:30 AM - 12:30 PM (Eastern Time) to answer questions from the 
community. To connect to the town hall meeting, follow this link:
