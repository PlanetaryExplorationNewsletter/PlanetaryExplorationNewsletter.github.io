NEW MASTERS IN ASTROBIOLOGY AND PLANETARY SCIENCE AT THE UNIVERSITY OF
EDINBURGH

In support of growing the breadth and depth of talent across
broad-based space and planetary science subject areas, the University
of Edinburgh has launched a new 1-year taught Masters in Astrobiology
and Planetary Sciences. Whilst this particular new course is of a
taught nature and the advertised application deadlines for this year
have passed, those preparing for success during the 2024 enrolment
call should note that they will have the opportunity to conduct a
modest research project over a three-month period to culminate in a
dissertation.

Contact points, entry requirements, and further information about this
postgraduate course - with some links to possible scholarships for
eligible candidates - can be accessed here:

AGU SESSION P002: A RETURN TO THE LUNAR SURFACE

Dear lunar colleagues,

When you are looking at what session to submit to at AGU, we hope you
will consider submitting abstracts related to current and future lunar
near-surface science.

A cadre of upcoming lunar science opportunities are currently in
development, including Artemis missions, near-term Commercial Lunar
Payload Services (CLPS) deliveries, and international missions all to
the lunar surface. This session highlights lunar science results from
recent missions, as well as preparations for upcoming surface
missions. We invite contributions that describe the new observational
capabilities and the transformative science enabled by upcoming
robotic and crewed lunar missions, or that place these in the context
of the current state of knowledge of the Moon, the Earth-Moon system,
and the Solar System. Future lunar science instruments and mission
concepts are also of interest.

Abstract deadline: August 2, 2023

AGU SESSION P008: CONCEPTS FOR FUTURE PLANETARY SCIENCE MISSIONS AND
INSTRUMENTS

Planetary science thrives on a steady stream of new data that results
from fresh, daring missions with progressively advancing complements
of instrumentation. NASA and other space agencies rely heavily on a
pipeline of innovative instrument and mission concepts, one that is
more varied and diverse that ever, ranging from atmospheric probes to
surface rovers, and spacecraft that orbit distant worlds or quickly
flyby to collect fleeting but important information. Likewise, the
instruments manifested on spacecraft come in a vast range of types and
complexities, from multi-stage mass spectrometers to simple
temperature sensors, deep-penetrating seismometers to space plasma
measurements and remote sensing imagers. Advanced spacecraft autonomy
and on-board data processing including machine-learning algorithms can
increase mission capabilities as well as the information content of
the returned data. We welcome cutting-edge science and technology
ideas for future planetary missions and instruments to showcase the
very forefront of next-generation planetary science research.

Abstract deadline is 2 August at 23:59 (EDT).

AGU SESSION P040: THE ICE GIANTS - EXPLORING THE PLANETARY SYSTEMS OF
URANUS AND NEPTUNE

The Uranus and Neptune planetary systems are among the most intriguing
and least explored in our Solar System, presenting exciting
opportunities for discoveries and serving as high-priority targets for
future space missions. This session invites submissions of
interdisciplinary topics covering all aspects of ice giant systems,
including interior structure, atmospheres, ionospheres,
magnetospheres, rings, satellites (including Triton), formation, and
evolution. The session welcomes presentations that advance our
understanding of ice giant systems from a range of perspectives
including observations, modeling, theory, and laboratory work.

With a Uranus orbiter and probe ranked as the highest-priority new
Flagship mission by the Planetary Decadal Survey (2023-2032), we
warmly welcome relevant studies in preparation for future remote
sensing and in situ explorations, including mission concepts and
instrument design studies relevant to the ice giant systems. We also
encourage comparative studies between the Uranus/Neptune systems and
other planetary bodies, within our solar system and beyond.

Please submit your abstract by August 2:

https://agu.confex.com/agu/fm23/prelim.cgi/Session/186895

We hope to see you at AGU!

AGU SESSION B078: TARGETING MICROHABITATS FOR LIFE DETECTION AND
BIOLOGICAL INVESTIGATIONS

Please consider sharing your science as part of our AGU session.
Abstacts are due 11:59 EDT August 2, 2023.

Current techniques to search and sample for life on other worlds are
typically designed to operate at "bulk" scales on the order of 1 cm3
or larger. Recent work examining microorganisms in native substrates
on Earth have shown life in ice-rich environments exists in
substantially smaller environments: hypersaline brines between ice
grains, sediment grains, or inside rock vesicles. Microhabitat
investigations, in conjunction with bulk sampling, enable us to
understand the geologic, climatic, geochemical, biological processes
that occur during the formation, maintenance, and alteration of icy
environments. These processes have implications both for life on Earth
and the search for life on other planetary bodies. Contributions that
investigate ice-rich microhabitats, instrumentation and technologies
that enable sampling, analysis of icy microhabitats on Earth, Mars,
and the Ocean Worlds, and analog field testing campaigns that explore
icy microhabitats to understand how life persists in these
environments to guide our search for life elsewhere.

VICAR MARS PROGRAMS (VISOR) RELEASED OPEN SOURCE

We are pleased to announce the version 5 release of the open source
VICAR image processing system.

As part of this release, we are including for the first time VISOR
(Vicar In-Situ Operations for Robotics), which is the set of programs
that do in-situ processing for all the recent NASA Mars surface
missions.

The community can now, for the first time, reproduce results for the
bulk of the Mars in-situ derived products in PDS. We look forward to
enhanced collaboration with the community via this open source release.

MASTCAM STEREO ANALYSIS AND MOSAICS (MSAM) DATA RELEASED TO PDS

The MSAM data set is now available in PDS:

https://tinyurl.com/extehc3w

MSAM is a ROSES 2016 PDART project that performed comprehensive,
systematic processing of MSL Mastcam data from the beginning of the
mission to Sol 2579.

Comprising 37.7 TB of data, MSAM produced disparity maps, XYZ data,
terrain meshes, and more for the 18,399 Mastcam stereo pairs in the
data range. It also produced 6 types of mosaics, including
Mastcam-Navcam context mosaics, orthorectified mosaics and DEMs,
stereo mosaics, and finder mosaics.

LABELOCITY, A PDS4 LABEL GENERATOR

Labelocity is a flexible, customizable, multimission automated system
for PDS4 label production, created by the NASA Jet Propulsion
Laboratory (JPL). It has been used to create most of the image,
browse, mesh, calibration and documentation labels for several key
missions, including the InSight and Mars 2020 missions. It is
designed to be extensible to new missions.

Labelocity consists of an extensive set of reusable Velocity macros,
and driver scripts with a wrapper around the PDS tool "mi-label". It
can create labels from a variety of data sources, including ODL
(PDS3), VICAR images, and JSON metadata.

Labelocity is available open source here:

SPECIAL ICARUS ISSUE ON LUNAR POLAR VOLATILES

We are happy to announce a new special issue in Icarus which will
focus on the the study of lunar polar volatiles, following a meeting
held in Boulder, CO last year. The special issue aims to showcase the
current state of knowledge on volatiles trapped in the lunar polar
regions, derived from theory, models, and observations, as well as
outstanding questions and goals that will be addressed by missions
anticipated in the coming decade.

We solicit articles that would illuminate the present-day inventory
and spatial distribution of lunar polar volatiles, as well as
processes affecting their history of accumulation, modification, and
erosion inside permanently shadowed regions. Testable predictions and
comparative analyses among cold-trapped volatiles on the Moon, Ceres,
and Mercury are also encouraged, as well as studies on upcoming
missions or mission concepts related to polar volatiles.
