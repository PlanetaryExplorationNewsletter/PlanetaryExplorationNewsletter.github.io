URANUS FLAGSHIP: INVESTIGATIONS AND INSTRUMENTS FOR CROSS-DISCIPLINE 
SCIENCE WORKSHOP

We are happy to announce the Uranus Flagship: Investigations and 
Instruments for Cross-Discipline Science Workshop scheduled for July 
25-27, 2023 in Pasadena, California, and virtually via Zoom.

The purpose of this workshop is to bring together scientists and 
engineers to discuss how cross-discipline discoveries in the Uranus 
system can be achieved through instrument concepts and synergistic 
scientific investigations. This differs from past workshops that were 
focused on traditional, discipline-specific Ice Giant science 
questions. All components of the Uranus System (interior to 
magnetosphere) are in our scope, as are ties to exoplanets, 
heliophysics, and astrophysics. Innovative aspects of mission or 
instrument design that enable cross-discipline science are also 
welcome. This workshop will advance planning for the Uranus Orbiter 
and Probe mission called for by the recently released Planetary 
Science and Astrobiology Decadal Survey.

Indication of Interest:

ABSTRACT DEADLINE EXTENSION FOR THERMOPS IV

We are pleased to inform the community that the abstract submission 
deadline for the Fourth Workshop on Thermal Models for Planetary 
Science has now been extended to: Tuesday 14 February (23:00 UTC)

We welcome submissions for presentation at TherMoPS IV:

https://www.cosmos.esa.int/web/thermops4/abstract-submission

TherMoPS IV will be held at the European Space Research and Technology 
Centre (ESTEC) in Noordwijk, The Netherlands, 18-20 April 2023. 
Remote participation will be possible for those unable to attend 
in-person. We expect to be able to offer some travel support for young 
professionals to attend in-person. Details will be announced when 
registration opens on 27 February, when the programme is published.

Themes identified for abstract submission include:
- Thermal modelling of rocky planets, asteroids and small bodies, the 
  Moon and moons of the Solar System, and gas giants
- Technical aspects of thermal modelling such as: models of thermal 
  evolution and thermal conductivity, disk-integrated vs disk-resolved 
  approaches, advances in theory and computational techniques
- Research to investigate thermal processes and validate thermal 
  models, via laboratory work and observations from observatories or 
  spacecraft
