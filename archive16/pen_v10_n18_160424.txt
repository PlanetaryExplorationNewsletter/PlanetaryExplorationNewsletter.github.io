POSTDOCTORAL POSITION AT THE SWEDISH INSTITUTE OF SPACE PHYSICS [1]

Postdoctoral Position in Space Physics to work with data from the 
Rosetta Ion Composition Analyzer

The Solar System Physics and Space Technology research programme at the 
Swedish Institute of Space Physics (http://www.irf.se) invites 
applications for a Postdoctoral position in Space Physics, related to 
the ESA Rosetta mission to comet 67P Churyumov-Gerasimenko. The
position is for studies of the cometary plasma environment and its 
interaction with the solar wind using ion data. The work mainly 
concerns data from the Ion Composition Analyzer (ICA) on board Rosetta 
and the other instruments that form the Rosetta Plasma Consortium 
(RPC).

The position, placed in Kiruna, is funded by the Swedish Research 
Council and is for 2 years. Previous experience of working with plasma 
and/or particle data from space missions is required. Relevant 
experience with planetary-solar wind interaction studies is a merit. 
Candidates should have completed a PhD no earlier than 2013 or must 
plan to have completed their PhD degree no later than August 2016.

Closing date is 16 May 2016.

POSTDOCTORAL POSITION AT THE SWEDISH INSTITUTE OF SPACE PHYSICS [2]

Postdoctoral Position in Space Physics to work with particle data from 
the Mars Express mission

The Solar System Physics and Space Technology research programme at the 
Swedish Institute of Space Physics (IRF) in Kiruna invites applications 
for a Postdoctoral position in Space Physics, related to the analysis 
of particle data from the ESA Mars Express mission. IRF is the 
Principal Investigator of the Analyzer of Space Plasmas and Energetic 
Atoms (ASPERA-3) on board Mars Express. ASPERA-3 has been operating at 
Mars since the Mars Express orbit insertion in 2003 and has collected a 
large volume of data related to the solar wind-Mars interaction.

The position, placed in Kiruna, is funded by the Swedish Research 
Council and is for 2 years. Previous experience of working with plasma 
and/or particle data from space missions is required. Relevant 
experience with planetary-solar wind interaction studies is a merit. 
Candidates should have completed a PhD no earlier than 2013 or must 
plan to have completed their PhD degree no later than August 2016.

POSTDOCTORAL POSITION AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO

The Department of the Geophysical Sciences at The University of Chicago 
seeks to hire a postdoctoral researcher to support investigations of 
the past Mars climate and atmosphere. The successful candidate will 
work with Assistant Professor Edwin Kite to modify and run Mars 
mesoscale models and Mars global climate models, and analyze the output 
of those models. The emphasis of the work will be on processes that 
operated early in Mars history and during the transition from Mars' 
early wetter climate to the present dry climate.

Candidates should have a background in Planetary Science, Earth
Science, or Astrophysics, and experience with modifying sophisticated
numerical models. Start date is flexible.

Deadline: July 15

Send a CV, a brief description of
research interests and experience, and a list of publications as a
single PDF file to kite@uchicago.edu. Applicants should also arrange
to have two letters of reference sent to this email address. Please
direct informal inquiries about this post to Edwin Kite
(kite@uchicago.edu).

This postdoctoral position will be for one year, with the possibility
of renewal for a second year, and comes with a competitive salary and
generous benefits.

[NASA] CITIZEN SCIENCE FOR EARTH SYSTEMS PROGRAM

The primary goal of the Citizen Science for Earth Systems Program
(NNH16ZDA001N-CSESP) is to develop and implement capabilities to 
harness voluntary contributions from members of the general public to 
advance understanding of the Earth as a system. The program aims to 
advance the use of citizen science in scientific research about the 
Earth by directly supporting citizen science activities, as well as by 
developing technology to further citizen science research.

Citizen science is defined as efforts or projects which use voluntary 
public participation in the scientific endeavor, including - but not 
limited to - formulating research questions, conducting experiments, 
collecting and analyzing data collected by citizen and/or professional 
scientists, interpreting results, making new discoveries, and/or 
developing technologies and applications. Crowdsourcing, another 
frequently used term describing voluntary contributions, is included 
under citizen science in this solicitation.

Through this solicitation, two types of proposals are sought - citizen 
science research and low cost sensor deployment for the collection of 
well calibrated citizen science data.

NOI Deadline: May 27, 2016 
Proposal Deadline: July 21, 2016

ABSTRACT DEADLINE EXTENDED FOR 3RD INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON THE 
EXPLORATION OF PHOBOS/DEIMOS

http://phobos-deimos.arc.nasa.gov/

New Deadline: 11:59p PDT, April 30, 2016

The Third International Conference on the Exploration of Phobos and 
Deimos, subtitled The Science, Robotic Reconnaissance, and Human 
Exploration of the Two Moons of Mars, will be the third international 
meeting focused on Phobos and Deimos, and on how their exploration 
relates to that of other small bodies, Mars, and the rest of the 
Solar System.

The conference will be an open international forum gathering 
scientists, engineers, space exploration professionals and students 
interested in discussing the status and advancement of the exploration 
of Mars' natural satellites, the investigation of other small bodies 
in relation to Phobos and Deimos, the exploration of Mars itself via 
its moons, and the importance of exploring these moons for Solar 
System science. The conference precedes the NASA Exploration Science 
Forum at NASA Ames Research Center on July 18-19, 2016.

THEMIS GEODETICALLY CONTROLLED MOSAICS AVAILABLE FROM THE USGS

THEMIS infrared geodetically controlled mosaics, updated spacecraft 
pointing and orientation information (i.e., preliminary smithed SPICE 
kernels), and supporting documentation are available for download and 
public use from the United States Geological Survey (USGS) Astrogeology 
Science Center. Twenty-one daytime infrared and twenty nighttime 
infrared mosaics are currently available, with additional mosaics being 
released each year until a global product is completed. These mosaics 
are tied to a known coordinate system (USGS Viking Orbiter Mars Digital 
Image Model 2.1), spatially adjusted to align feature boundaries, and 
orthoprojected at 100 m/pixel scale. This process results in sub-pixel 
registration between images and the daytime IR and nighttime IR mosaics 
to be well-registered to one another. These products enhance our 
knowledge (e.g., position, precision, and accuracy) of image placement 
and the location of small-scale surface features, and will benefit the 
current and future orbital acquisition of data, the planning of 
spacecraft and surface operations, and allows for easier and improved 
intercomparison of all Mars data sets.

Please see the following website for product download and additional 
documentation:

-preliminary-smithed-kernels

9TH COSMIC DUST MEETING - SECOND CIRCULAR

Date: August 15-19, 2016
Location: Tohoku University, Sendai, Japan

This series of meetings aims at establishing a consensus among experts 
on the formation and evolution of cosmic dust: where it comes from and 
where it goes. The primary objective of the meeting is to bring 
together professionals who deal with cosmic dust as well as provide an 
opportunity for participants to develop interpersonal relationships 
and scientific interactions among themselves. All kinds of cosmic dust 
will be considered from interstellar and disk dust to regolith 
particles and planetary aerosols.

Attendees are limited to 50 people. Please, submit you application by 
May 13, 2016, 11:59 p.m. Japan Standard Time (GMT+09:00). The early 
bird rate of 10,000 JPY is available for those who complete both 
admissions application and abstract submission by April 30, 2016 
(later - 15,000 JPY). The registration fee should be paid by cash on 
arrival at the venue.
