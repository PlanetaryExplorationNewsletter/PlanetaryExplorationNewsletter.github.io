ROSES-16 AMENDMENT 3: SEPARATELY UPLOAD TOTAL BUDGET FILES FOR
ROSES-2016 PROPOSALS

ROSES-2016 was released with new budget rules barring the inclusion of
any salary or indirect rate information from the proposal document to
prevent this information from being seen by peer reviewers, see
Section IV(b)(iii) of the ROSES-2016 Summary of Solicitation. Although
ROSES-2016 already required that the full budget must be provided in
the NSPIRES cover page budgets, many proposers needed a better way to
provide to NASA detailed budgetary information. This Amendment allows
proposers to provide that additional information to NASA without it
being seen by peer reviewers.

With this amendment, all ROSES program elements allow proposers to
separately upload a "Total Budget" PDF to the same ROSES program
element NSPIRES "response structure" to which the proposal is
submitted. More information on requirements for ROSES-2016 budgets
may be found at:

The NASA point of contact for ROSES-2016 is Max Bernstein
(max.bernstein@nasa.gov).

AGU PLANETARY SCIENCE SECTION STARTS NEW CONGRESSIONAL PROGRAM

Are you a planetary science student or post-doc who is interested in
getting involved with the legislative funding process? The AGU
Planetary Sciences Section is starting a new program where students
and early career scientists will visit their congressional
representative's local office to share their research and advocate
for continued planetary science funding. Training will be done
through AGU's Public Affairs Office in May, and visits will take
place during the August and October recesses. To learn more and
sign up, visit the PS Section website:

EXOPLANETS BIOSIGNATURES WORKSHOP WITHOUT WALLS

A NExSS and Astrobiology Program Joint Workshop

The NASA Nexus for Exoplanet System Science (NExSS) and Astrobiology
Program are hosting an Exoplanet Biosignatures Workshop Without Walls
to review, frame, and advance the science and technology of remotely
detectable biosignatures for the search for life on planets around
other stars. Future exoplanet observations will soon focus on the
search for life beyond the Solar System. Biosignatures to be sought
are those with global, potentially detectable, impacts on a planet.
Biosignatures occur in an environmental context in which geological,
atmospheric, and stellar processes and interactions may work to
enhance, suppress, or mimic these biosignatures. The workshop will
bring together scientists from astronomy, planetary science,
Earth sciences, heliophysics, biology, biogeochemistry, and
instrument/mission development.

When/Where:

mid-April, 2016: Pre-workshop online activities to commence
July 27-29, 2016:  In-person workshop (and online participation),

NEOWISE 2016 DATA RELEASE

The Near-Earth Object Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (NEOWISE)
and the Infrared Processing and Analysis Center (IPAC) announce the
NEOWISE 2016 Data Release.

The 2016 Release includes all data acquired during the second year of
the NEOWISE Reactivation mission (Mainzer et al. 2014, ApJ, 792, 30),
13 December 2014 to 13 December 2015.  These data are combined with
the Year 1 data into a single archive that contains ~5.1 million 3.4
and 4.6 micron images and a database of ~38.1 billion source
detections extracted from those images.

NEOWISE scanned the sky nearly four complete times during the first
two years of survey operations, with approximately six months between
survey passes. Twelve or more independent 3.4 and 4.6 micron exposures
are made on each point of the sky during each pass. Thus, the NEOWISE
archive is a time-domain resource for extracting multiple, independent
thermal flux and position measurements of solar system small bodies,
as well as background galactic and extragalactic sources.

A quick guide to the NEOWISE data release, data access instructions
and supporting documentation is available at:

http://wise2.ipac.caltech.edu/docs/release/neowise/

NEOWISE data products are available at:

http://irsa.ipac.caltech.edu

NEOWISE is a project of the JPL/CalTech and is funded by NASA.

EUROPLANET CALL FOR ACCESS TO PLANETARY ANALOGUE SITES: IBN BATTUTA
CENTRE AND OTEHRS

Deadline: April 29th, 2016

A Call to access planetary sites including Ibn Battuta Centre field
sites, Rio Tito, Iceland and Laboratories is out. Deadline April 29th,
2016. The grants will cover field costs and logistic support as well
as scientific collaboration. EU citizens and national of Associated
Country can apply. Non EU states and associated countries citizen can
apply following some rules that can be read in the call. For
information on the Ibn Battuta Centre:

http://www.ibnbattutacentre.org

and visit the Europlanet section. Access is provided for scientists to
perform high quality scientific research and test instrumentation
for space missions under realistic planetary conditions and undertake
comparative planetology research.

SIGNATURES AND SUPPORT SOUGHT FOR OPEN LETTER TO SENIOR COMMUNITY
MEMBERS TO BATTLE HARASSMENT

Planetary science and space exploration community members,

Please read and sign this letter (and pass it further):

https://sites.google.com/site/openlettertoseniorscience/

There has been much discussion in the news recently about sexual
harassment in several fields - and those that have made it to media
visibility are generally only the most extreme cases. To define
the needed change and to enact that change, we need visibility
and people involved and invested at all career levels -
most especially senior members of our community, as they often
have the largest influence on culture and institutional policies/
enforcement. This letter calls for that engagement.

This letter will likely be published in one of our community's
journals to emphasize further the importance of discussions and 
actions.

(And, as possible, please think about what you can do - beyond the
letter - about making our community more inclusive. We define our
culture, so it is up to each one of us to see the problems and create
the change we think is needed.)

Many thanks,

Dr. Serina Diniega, Mars scientist and one of the open letter
co-authors

US PLANETARY SCIENTISTS: IS YOUR LABORATORY ADEQUATELY SUPPORTED?

The Planetary Science Subcommittee (PSS) perceives that laboratories
supporting Planetary Science Division (PSD) research may be
underfunded, and that support for laboratory technical staff is
difficult to obtain.

PSS is conducting a survey of laboratories that will be used to inform
discussions with PSD about the planetary communityâ€™s capabilities and
challenges, and to help formulate potential solutions.
