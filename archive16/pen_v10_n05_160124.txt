COMETARY SCIENCE AFTER ROSETTA: FUTURE DIRECTIONS

London, June 16-17, 2016

At this meeting, we shall review the current status of the field of 
cometary science following the keenly anticipated results of Rosetta, 
with the aim to engender focused, collaborative studies of these 
fascinating objects. The programme will include solicited presentations 
and talks and posters given by the attendees.

This meeting will immediately follow the Royal Society Discussion 
Meeting: Cometary science after Rosetta, also to be held in London, 
on June 14-15:

AOGS SESSION PS04: COMPARATIVE AERONOMY OF SOLAR SYSTEM BODIES

Please consider submitting an abstract for Session PS04 at the 
AOGS Meeting in Beijing (Jul 31 - Aug 5, 2016).

http://www.asiaoceania.org/aogs2016

Aeronomy is the study of the upper regions of planetary atmospheres 
where ionization and dissociation are important. Over the past 
several decades, many planetary missions have contributed 
substantially to our knowledge of the physical, chemical, and 
dynamical processes occurring within the mesospheres, thermospheres, 
exospheres, and ionospheres of various Solar System objects, as well 
as the couplings of these regions both downward with the lower 
atmospheres and upward with the plasma environments. The comparative 
approach is becoming increasingly fruitful when applied to Solar 
System objects as both spacecraft- and ground-based datasets are 
accumulated and interpreted by sophisticated multi-species fluid 
and kinetic models. In this session, we invite abstracts on 
observational, theoretical, and experimental results of different 
aspects of aeronomical processes within the Solar System. We also 
invite presentations on relevant future planetary missions 
(scientific goals, instrumentations, etc.). Both solicited and 
contributed talks will be included.

31ST IUGG CONFERENCE ON MATHEMATICAL GEOPHYSICS, PARIS

Geophysics, from Mathematics to Experiments

The 31st edition of the IUGG Conference on Mathematical Geophysics 
(CMG) is to be held at the Institut Henri Poincare (Paris) on June 6th 
to 10th, 2016. CMG covers a wide spectrum of current research topics 
in Geophysics: physical based modelling and measurements in Geophysics, 
using mathematical and numerical approaches, spanning terrestrial, 
atmospheric and oceanic flows, seismology, modelling of seismic 
sources and eruptions. This conference is traditionally dedicated to 
theoretical and modeling works but in 2016, it will also emphasize 
works with an experimental side or related to experimental 
investigation -- in particular conceptual experiments that address 
physical mechanisms and scaling laws. A dedicated session on 
Planetary Geophysics is chaired by Ralph Lorenz (APL) and Norbert 
Schorghofer (Hawaii).

Please note the dates and visit:

http://cmg2016.sciencesconf.org  

for more details, abstract templates and schedule. Note that
the deadline for abstract submission has been extended to 31st 
January 2016. Registration will open in February.

2016 MICROSCOPY AND MICROANALYSIS CONFERENCE

Please join us in Columbus at the 2016 Microscopy and Microanalysis 
Conference. Planetary Science will be highlighted in our symposium, 
"From Angstrom to AU: Studies of Planet-Forming Materials." The 
abstract deadline is February 8 (LPSC abstracts can be easily 
converted to the M&M format). Conference details can be found at: 

http://microscopy.org/MandM/2016

If you have any questions, please contact:
Eve Berger (eve.l.berger@nasa.gov),
Adrian Brearley (brearley@unm.edu), or 
Francis McCubbin (francis.m.mccubbin@nasa.gov).

Session P09: Micro- and nano-scale analyses of planetary materials 
(e.g., meteorites, IDPs, asteroidal and Lunar return samples, and 
experimental and terrestrial analogs) inform our understanding of 
our solar system's history. With the development of new techniques 
and novel implementations (EPMA, EELS, EDS, SIMS, FTIR, APT, EBSD, 
XCT, microscale geochronology, etc.) we further maximize the 
information gleaned from small-sample analyses. This meeting will 
report current research milestones gained through the use of these 
techniques, both individually and as part of coordinated analyses 
of planetary materials.

ICARUS SPECIAL ISSUE ON THE PLUTO SYSTEM IN THE NEW HORIZONS ERA

A special issue of Icarus brings together papers about Pluto system
science. In 2015, NASA's New Horizons mission conducted the first ever
reconnaissance of the Pluto system. Partly fueled by this flyby, the
Pluto system has also been a subject of intense observational and
theoretical study. If you are working on a paper related to the Pluto
system, you are invited to select it for inclusion in the special
issue on the Pluto system in the New Horizons era.

Submission Format:

Submitted papers must be written in English and describe original
research which is neither published nor currently under review by
other journals. Review papers will be considered only with prior
invitation by the editors. Author guidelines for preparation of
manuscripts can be found at:

http://www.elsevier.com/journals/icarus/0019-1035/guide-for-authors

PHD POSITION ON VENUS CLOUDS & CLIMATE 

Aerospace Engineering of the Technological University of Delft, 
the Netherlands.

Within this project, Venus' clouds and hazes will be studied using 
flux and polarization observations by instruments aboard ESA's Venus 
Express mission. Knowing the properties of Venus' clouds and hazes 
is crucial for understanding Venus' climate and climates of 
terrestrial (exo)planets. The analysis will be done with a radiative 
transfer code covering both the sunlight that is reflected by Venus 
and the thermal radiation emitted by Venus. 

This fully funded, 4-year project involves collaborations with 
scientists in France, Germany and the UK, as well as with astronomers 
in Leiden. 

The ideal candidate has an MSc in physics, astronomy, planetary 
sciences or related fields, solid numerical modelling skills, and 
an aptitude to code development. Experience with analyzing 
observations would be an asset, as would be knowledge on atmospheric 
dynamics and/or chemistry and radiative transfer. 

For information on the PhD-program at TU Delft and Aerospace
Engineering (AE), see:

http://graduateschool.tudelft.nl

Applicants should send a CV and a letter of motivation to: 
Dr. Daphne Stam (d.m.stam@tudelft.nl) and 
Dr. Loic Rossi (l.c.g.rossi@tudelft.nl).

The application deadline is February 26th, 2016.

DEADLINE EXTENDED - AEOLIAN RESEARCH SPECIAL ISSUE FOR THE FOURTH 
INTERNATIONAL PLANETARY DUNES WORKSHOP

Deadline for submission of final manuscripts is March 4, 2016.

The Fourth International Planetary Dunes Workshop: Integrating Models, 
Remote Sensing, and Field Data was held May 19-22, 2015 in Boise, 
Idaho (see Final Announcement). More than 60 researchers and students 
participated in two and a half days of presentations and lively 
discussion, plus a full day field trip to Bruneau Dunes State Park. 
The workshop focused on the many landforms and deposits created by the 
dynamic interactions between granular material and airflow (aeolian 
processes). These processes are known to occur on several planetary 
bodies, including Earth, Mars, Titan, Venus, and most recently the 
surface of a comet.

A special issue in Aeolian Research is planned to highlight the results 
presented at the workshop, in addition to other recent aeolian studies 
of planetary surfaces. Manuscripts on any topic within planetary 
aeolian studies are solicited, but those focusing on planetary dune 
systems are particularly encouraged. While terrestrial analog studies 
are welcome for the special issue, these manuscripts should include 
discussion of how the results relate to the analysis of features in 
planetary environments.

Please contact Matthew Chojnacki (chojan1@pirl.lpl.arizona.edu) with 
any questions.
