SEEKING MEMBERS FOR THE WFIRST SOLAR SYSTEM WORKING GROUP

NASA's Wide Field Infrared Survey Telescope (WFIRST) is NASA's next 
flagship mission after JWST. WFIRST is on track for a 2025 launch and 
a 6 year primary mission. This mission has two primary instruments: the 
Wide Field Instrument (WFI) with a 0.25 square degree FOV and the 
Coronagraph Instrument (CGI), which is designed to take images and 
spectra of super-Earths. Between the two instruments, WFIRST will be 
capable of imaging and grism spectroscopy over the wavelength range 
0.7-2 microns as well as R~100 spectroscopy with an IFU. More details 
can be found here: 

https://wfirst.gsfc.nasa.gov/ 
 
We are soliciting participants for the WFIRST Solar System Working 
Group to help develop science cases and provide input to the project 
team on instrumentation and observatory constraints. If you are 
interested please contact either of the co-leads, James (Gerbs) Bauer 
(JPL - james.m.bauer@jpl.nasa.gov) or Stefanie Milam (NASA/GSFC - 
Stefanie.n.milam@nasa.gov) by December 30, 2016.

VENUS EXPLORATION ANALYSIS GROUP (VEXAG) CALL FOR EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE 
MEMBERS

VEXAG is seeking volunteers for VEXAG Executive Committee members to 
replace those who have successfully completed their service to the 
Venus community. The new members will start in 2017 for a term that run 
for three years. Also, the VEXAG Early Career Scholars Focus Group is 
looking for interested group members.

If you are interested, send your resume and a statement of how you

VEXAG activities for the next three years are expected to be community 
building with an emphasis on:

- Venus Exploration Goals, Objectives, and Strategies
- Technology Development and Laboratory Measurements
- International Collaboration
- Early Career and Young Scholar Development
- Venus Exploration Roadmaps

VEXAG is a community-based forum established in July 2005 to assess 
scientific priorities and strategies for exploration of Venus. VEXAG 
is currently composed of a chair and five focus groups, where the 
focus groups actively solicit input from the Venus community on the 
topics listed above.

WORKING GROUP ON FINDING SIGNS OF PAST ROCK-HOSTED LIFE

Motivated by the suite of habitable environments available to Mars-2020 
for in situ exploration and sample collection, we are convening a set 
of 4 web-hosted telecons, open to the community. For those wishing to 
help make a presentation and peer-reviewed publication, there will also 
be an in-person gathering February 6-7 at Caltech. See:

http://web.gps.caltech.edu/~rocklife2017/

The first talk, "Martian Environments, Facies, and Ages: Evidence for 
Rock-Hosted Waters. What is the evidence for ancient Mars environmental 
conditions? What is the likelihood of habitats for rock-hosted life?"
will be either 8:30am December 9 or December 19th. Pencil in (no 
newsletter in between the closing of Doodle poll!) and check out the 
website Wednesday 12/7 for date and dial-in information.
