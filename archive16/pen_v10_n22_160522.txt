SPECIAL ANNOUNCEMENT: NASA SHARED SERVICES CENTER GRANT REPORT NOTICE 
SYSTEM OUT OF ORDER

We have received reports of Friendly Reminders and 1st, 2nd & 3rd 
delinquent notices of required grant progress reports by scientists
when reports had already been filed, sometimes months previously. 
We have also received a report of no reminder notices being sent 
out since late 2015 to at least one institution. NSSC reports that 
it has been transitioning to a new tracking system for grant and 
cooperative agreement progress report submission. "It is a temporary 
occurrence until the system catches up with the reminder sequence." 
If things are still problematic in another month, we recommend you 
communicate with sara@nasa.gov. We will also be in touch with SARA.

[NASA] EDUCATION AERONAUTICS SCHOLARSHIP AND ADVANCED STEM TRAINING 
AND RESEARCH (AS&ASTAR) FELLOWSHIP

This activity supports the vitality and diversity of the STEM 
workforce of NASA and the United States by training and funding 
graduate students during their STEM academic endeavors and providing 
access to NASA, its content, unique facilities, and STEM experts.

Specific award objectives:

1. Improve the nation's future STEM workforce by developing the 
skills and competencies of graduates pursuing degrees in STEM 
disciplines, one student at a time;

2. Provide opportunities for a diverse population to participate 
and contribute to NASA's missions and projects;

3. Use NASA's unique mission content, workforce, and facilities 
in order to enhance and increase the capabilities, diversity, and 
size of the nation's next generation workforce needed to enable 
future NASA discoveries;

4. Improve the rates at which students, who have historically been 
underrepresented in NASA-related fields, are awarded graduate 
degrees at their respective universities in the STEM fields.

POSTDOCTORAL POSITION IN MARS SCIENCE

The Department of Planetology and Habitability at the Centro de 
Astrobiologia (CAB) invites applications for a postdoctoral position 
to support investigations on the nature of the early Mars
environments. The successful candidate will work with Dr. Alberto 
Fairen in the ERC-funded Project "icyMARS": 

https://erc.europa.eu/projects-and-results/erc-funded-projects/icymars

Applicants should have a recent Ph.D. in the field of Planetary 
Science or related discipline, and a background in Mars research. 
Expertise in Geochemistry or Microbiology would be helpful, but not 
required.

The position, placed in Madrid, would be for two years, with possible 
extension to a third year contingent upon funding availability and 
satisfactory performance. Benefits include working in a young 
enthusiastic team at one of the leading Planetary Sciences 
institutions in Europe, full social benefits according to the Spanish 
social care system, and a very competitive salary.

Applicants should send a letter of interest, a curriculum with a list 
of publications, a brief (maximum two pages) statement of research 
interests, and a list of three references, no later than July, 1 2016, 
to Alberto Fairen (agfairen@cab.inta-csic.es).

The starting date is negotiable, but should be no later than 
Jan 1, 2017.

POSTDOCTORAL RESEARCH SCIENTISTS

The Planetary Science Institute (EOE/M/F/Vet/Disability) in 
collaboration with The CosmoQuest Virtual Research Facility is 
interested in hiring two Postdoctoral Research Scientists with 
concentrations in:

(1) earth and planetary science and 
(2) astrophysics and heliophysics, 

to work closely with scientists, educators, and the general public 
through CosmoQuest.  

CosmoQuest provides the general public and educators opportunities to 
learn through classes and web content, and to contribute to NASA SMD 
related science in meaningful ways. These postdocs are research-
focused positions. Postdocs will collaboratively work to ensure that 
citizen science results can be used to advance the understanding of 
the universe, and will be expected to aid in or lead projects that 
produce peer-reviewed science publications. The official job(s) 
description and application can be found at:

http://www.psi.edu/about/hr 

under "Science Support Staff - Current Openings."

Thank you for your time,
Jennifer Grier

USRA: SOFIA HEAD OF COMMUNICATIONS AND PUBLIC OUTREACH

USRA is seeking a knowledgeable and experienced Head of 
Communications and Public Outreach to deliver high impact 
scientific results to the public, the astronomical community, 
and NASA management.

Responsibilities:

(1) Lead a team of communications specialists at USRA, and work 
closely with NASA Public Affairs and the science community. A key 
role is to maximize the exposure of the most intellectually engaging 
and potentially newsworthy science coming from the Stratospheric 
Observatory for Infrared Astronomy (SOFIA), build the visibility for 
the science behind SOFIA, and conduct Science Outreach, Public 
Engagement and Public Affairs activities.

(2) Be responsible for the Public Affairs, Public Outreach and 
Scientific Outreach programs for the SOFIA program. The incumbent 
will manage the staff and activities associated with the public 
affairs and outreach programs and will be held accountable for 
achieving the objectives established by NASA and USRA for keeping 
the science community, the media, and the public at large 
informed as to the scientific status of SOFIA, its accomplishments, 
and opportunities for participation in the Observatory's programs.

(3) Provide leadership and vision to continue and grow SOFIA's 
successful astronomy news and public outreach program.

JOB POSTING: GEOMICROBIOLOGIST AT NASA JOHNSON SPACE CENTER

JSC's Astromaterials Acquisition and Curation Office anticipates a 
hiring opportunity for a geomicrobiology or astrobiology researcher 
to serve NASA as curator for biological components in astromaterials. 

Qualifications: 

Expertise in -  
(1) biological cleanliness and quantitative biological contaminant 
    characterization; 
(2) chemical, mineralogical, or petrological consequences of 
    microbial interaction with astromaterials, astromaterials 
    simulants, and terrestrial analogs of astromaterials; or 
(3) sample collection and handling of geological materials that 
    contain microbial matter. The successful candidate shall develop 
    an externally funded research program in the area of 
    geomicrobiology and/or astrobiology. 

Additional duties include development and implementation of curation 
plans for astromaterials returned from future missions with possible 
extraterrestrial biological components; conducting advanced curation 
research to prevent biological contamination of NASA's past, present, 
and future astromaterials collections, and developing methods of 
monitoring for biological contamination within curation facilities 
and in NASA's astromaterials collections. This individual will also 
provide expertise in the area of contamination knowledge as it

ICES IN THE SOLAR SYSTEM - FIRST ANNOUNCEMENT

We invite you to the "Ices in the Solar System" workshop at the 
European Space Astronomy Centre near Madrid, Spain. The workshop 
will be organised in January 2017. The duration of the meeting will 
be 3 to 4 days, no registration fees are expected.

Register at:

http://www.cosmos.esa.int/web/ices-in-the-solar-system/home
  
The latest advances in experimental research to support the 
interpretation of remote sensing observations on current and future 
missions observing the surfaces of icy bodies will be reviewed. The 
weathering of ices across the Solar System, in particular under 
plasma and dust bombardment in the magnetospheres of Gas Giants 
like Jupiter and Saturn, will be an important theme. Finally, the 
Rosetta mission has been continuing the examination of the 
distribution and role played by amorphous and/or crystalline ices 
in small bodies. The ability of different types of ices to trap
chemical tracers is fundamental to constraining evolutionary models 
of the Solar System.
 
This workshop will revolve around the following main themes:
* Volatiles in ices
* Surface-Ice chemistry
* Geology of icy bodies
* Laboratory analogs
* Ices within the current snowline

[NASA] PDS - MARS RECONNAISSANCE ORBITER CRISM MTRDR AND TER RELEASE 2

PDS announces the second release of Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter CRISM 
Targeted Empirical Data Record (TER) and Map-projected Targeted 
Reduced Data Record (MTRDR) products, with coverage through 
August 7, 2008. TER products are image cubes derived from CRISM 
hyperspectral targeted observations, post-processed to standardize 
the illumination and observation geometry and remove atmospheric gas 
absorptions and instrument artifacts. MTRDR products are the same 
data map-projected using terrain models of the Martian surface. 
MTRDR and TER releases are scheduled every three months, in May, 
August, November and March.
