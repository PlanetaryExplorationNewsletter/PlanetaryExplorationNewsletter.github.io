IN MEMORIAM: EDGARD G. YANOVITSKIJ (1937 - 2016)

The Ukrainian scientific community is sad to announce the passing 
of Professor Edgard G. Yanovitskij on 23 June 2016. Dr. Yanovitskij 
spent his entire professional life as a leading researcher at the Main
Astronomical Observatory of the Ukrainian National Academy of Sciences
in Kyiv. As a prominent member of the famous Soviet school of
radiative transfer founded by Academicians Viktor Ambartsumian and
Viktor Sobolev, he had devoted most of his exemplary career to the
study of radiative energy transport in planetary atmospheres and
analyses of spectrophotometric observations of planets. His most
profound accomplishments include the general analysis of principles of
invariance, the analytical theory of radiative transfer in vertically
inhomogeneous atmospheres, and the development of extremely efficient
and numerically accurate computer solvers of the radiative transfer
equation. His seminal contributions were summarized in the monograph
on "Light Scattering in Inhomogeneous Atmospheres" published by
Springer. For many years, Dr. Yanovitskij served as an Editorial Board
Member for the "Journal of Quantitative Spectroscopy and Radiative
Transfer" and "Kinematics and Physics of Celestial Bodies." His
research accomplishments were celebrated by numerous professional
awards, including the National Prize of Ukraine in Science and
Technology. Professor Yanovitsky will always be remembered as an 
outstanding scientist and an exceptional human being.

IN MEMORIAM: GERALD J. WASSERBURG (1927-2016)

Gerald J. Wasserburg was an American geologist. At the time of his 
death, he was the John D. MacArthur Professor of Geology and 
Geophysics, Emeritus, at the California Institute of Technology. 

Wasserburg was deeply involved in the Apollo program with the 
returned lunar samples. He pioneered the precise measurement of 
ultra-small samples under strict clean room conditions with
minimal contamination. He was also the co-inventor of the Lunatic 
Spectrometer (the first fully digital, mass spectrometer with 
computer controlled magnetic field scanning and rapid switching) 
and founder of the "Lunatic Asylum" research laboratory at Caltech, 
which specialized in high-precision, high-sensitivity isotopic
analyses of meteorites and lunar samples. He and his co-workers were 
major contributors to establishing a chronology for the Moon and 
proposed the hypothesis of the late heavy bombardment (LHB) of the 
whole inner solar system.

Wasserburg's research led to a better understanding of the origins 
and history of the solar system and its component bodies and the 
precursor stellar sources contributing to the solar system. This 
research established a timescale for the development of the early 
solar system, including the processes of nucleosynthesis and the 
formation and evolution of the planets, the Moon, and the meteorites.

AGU 2016 SESSION P030: THE EARLY MARS ENVIRONMENT - WARM AND WET, COLD 
AND WET, OR COLD AND ICY?

We invite contributions to a session focused on the environment of 
early Mars, at the 2016 AGU Fall Meeting in San Francisco, CA, 
December 12-16.

Geological, geochemical and mineralogical evidence indicative of 
flowing and ponding liquid water on the surface of ancient Mars 
appears abundantly across most of the Martian landscape. However, 
the presence of liquid water on the surface of early Mars is difficult 
to reconcile with the reduced solar luminosity at 3.8 Ga and before, 
unless greenhouse warming is considered. But the scarcity of carbonate 
rocks on the martian surface and the absence of evidence for vigorous 
recycling of volatiles cause many researchers to regard warming 
mechanisms as speculative. This leaves still open the question of 
how the observed fluvial features could have formed. We invite 
contributions from climate modeling, geomorphology, geochemistry 
and mineralogy that address the question of whether early Mars 
climate was "warm and wet", "cold and wet" or "cold and icy". This 
session will focus on both sharing new results from different 
perspectives and fostering communication among the community.

Submission deadline: August 5, 2016.

AGU 2016 SESSION P033: TITAN - CONSTRAINING AN OCEAN WORLD
 
San Francisco 12-16th December 2016
We welcome submission of abstracts via the AGU portal at: 

https://fallmeeting.agu.org/2016/abstract-submissions/
 
The joint NASA/ESA Cassini mission has established Titan as a prime 
location for investigating the limits of life. Cassini has studied 
Titan's interior, seasonal changes on its surface and atmosphere, 
and the atmosphere's interaction with an energetic magnetosphere. 
Cassini finds surface-atmosphere interactions producing erosional 
features similar to Earth's, including dunes, mountains, rivers, 
alluvial deposits, and features suggesting recent cryovolcanism.   
There is also evidence for a salty ocean interior and accumulations 
of liquid hydrocarbons are evident on its surface. The atmosphere's 
interaction with the magnetosphere produces a continuous supply of 
new organic material. The inclusion of Titan as a target for 
exploration by missions under NASA's New Frontiers program highlights 
broad solar system community interest in this scientifically rich moon.  
This session will explore new results that intend to provide a 
comprehensive and integrated understanding of Titan's interior, 
surface, and atmosphere, along with the atmosphere's interaction with 
the Saturn's energetic environment.

Deadline for abstracts: Wednesday, 3 August 23:59 EDT.
 
Conveners: Robert M. Nelson (PSI), Rosaly Lopes (JPL), 
Conor A Nixon (NASA GFSC), Joseph H Westlake (JHU APL)

AGU 2016 SESSION SH009: ICME AND ENERGETIC PARTICLE INTERACTIONS 
IN THE HELIOSPHERE AND AT SOLAR SYSTEM BODIES 

We invite contributions to the special session SH009, at the AGU Fall
Meeting in San Francisco, December 12-16. The session is cross-listed 
with Planetary Sciences and SPA-Magnetospheric Physics.

Simultaneous measurement of radiation, plasma, and magnetic fields 
at multiple locations (e.g., the Moon, Mars, comets) has ushered in 
an era where it is possible to study energetic solar events as they
propagate through the Solar System. The effects of the same energetic 
solar events on different types of bodies can also be compared and 
contrasted. The publicly available analysis tools at the Community 
Coordinated Modeling Center facilitate these studies by helping 
identify conjunctions or magnetic connections between observing 
locations. This session aims to tie together topics on interplanetary 
coronal mass ejections (ICMEs) and energetic particle propagation and 
evolution in the heliosphere, along with resulting effects on Solar 
System bodies; such as those relating to space weathering of the 
surface and subsurface, as well as changes to magnetospheres, 
ionospheres, or exospheres.

To submit an abstract (Deadline August 3rd, 2016):
