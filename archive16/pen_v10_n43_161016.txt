PLENARY AT DPS: ADDRESSING UNCONSCIOUS BIAS

Patricia Knezek
Wednesday, October 19th, 2016: 2:00-2:20 PM, Ballroom D

Abstract: Unconscious bias reflects expectations or stereotypes 
that influence our judgments of others (regardless of our own group). 
Everyone has unconscious biases. The end result of unconscious bias 
can be an accumulation of advantage or disadvantage that impacts the 
long-term career success of individuals, depending on which biases 
they are subject to. In order to foster a professional culture and 
climate, being aware of these unconscious biases and mitigating 
against them is a first step. This is particularly important when 
judgments are needed, such as in cases for recruitment, choice of 
speakers for conferences, and even reviewing papers submitted for 
publication. This presentation will cover how unconscious bias 
manifests itself, what evidence exists to demonstrate it exists, 
and ways it can be addressed.

JAPANESE SOCIETY FOR THE PROMOTION OF SCIENCE (JSPS) CORE-TO-CORE 
PROGRAM PLANET2 SYMPOSIUM 2017

Symposium web site: 

https://www-n.oca.eu/michel/JSPSPlanet2_2017/

The JSPS Core-to-Core Program Planet2 Symposium 2017 will take place 
on February 20-23, 2017 in Villefranche Sur Mer (France) on the 
Cote d'Azur. The Symposium aims at reviewing recent ongoing and 
upcoming space missions and observations and recent progress in 
planet formation theories. Also we will discuss how we should 
synthesize these observational constraints to improve our 
understanding of planetary formation inside and outside the solar 
system. Topics will include remote-sensing observations of small 
bodies from a spacecraft or from ground-based observatories, 
microanalyses of samples from small bodies, observations of 
exoplanets from both space-based and ground-based telescopes, and 
planetary formation theories (from disk formation/evolution to 
current planetary system properties). Opportunities for 
international exchanges of young scholars in this field of 
science will also be discussed.

Registration and abstract submission will open soon and an 
announcement will be forthcoming. Please save the dates if 
you're interested.

CALL FOR PAPERS: ICARUS SPECIAL ISSUE ON ASTEROIDS

There have been major advances in asteroid science in the last decade 
and, as that trend continues, we think it is the appropriate time to 
incorporate manuscripts reporting the results of new research from 
the field into a single special journal issue. Expecting that this 
will increase the impact and visibility of these papers, we have 
made arrangements with the journal Icarus for the publication of 
a special issue on asteroids.

Topics of interest include, but are NOT limited to:

* Near-Earth Asteroids and Impact Hazards
* Surveys and Exploration
* Asteroid Population Models
* Asteroid Origins and Characterization
* Asteroid Compositions
* Asteroid Spins, Sizes, and Shapes
* Asteroid Interiors
* Asteroid Families
* Active Asteroids
* Collisions and Cratering
* Orbit Determination and Propagation
* Dynamical Evolution

Guest Editors:

Bojan Novakovic
Henry Hsieh
Giovanni F. Gronchi

Important Dates:

First submission: November 1st 2016
Deadline for paper submission: January 15th 2017

Manuscripts should be submitted through the EVISE e-learning platform 
located at:

https://www.evise.com/profile/#/ICARUS/ 

The authors must select "Special Issue: Asteroids" at the 
"Article Type" step in the submission process. 

Pre-submission questions regarding the topics of interest should be 
directed to bojan@math.rs

[NASA] ROSES-16 FINAL TEXT RELEASED FOR THE NEW FRONTIERS DATA 
ANALYSIS PROGRAM

The objective of the New Frontiers Data Analysis Program (NFDAP) is 
to enhance the scientific return from New Frontiers missions by 
broadening scientific participation in the analysis and interpretation 
of data returned by these missions. Other mission and nonmission data 
sets may be used to supplement these data in a supporting role, but 
all proposals require the use of data from at least one New Frontiers 
mission. This program solicits research proposals to conduct 
scientific investigations utilizing or enhancing the utilization of 
data obtained by the New Frontiers missions. Please note that, 
similar to the Cassini Data Analysis Program and unlike target-focused 
Data Analysis Programs, NFDAP also permits the use of New Frontiers 
mission data for certain comparative planetology studies.

Step-1 proposals are due February 8, 2017
Step-2 proposals are due May 3, 2017

[NASA] MARTIAN MOONS EXPLORATION (MMX) MISSION SALMON-2 SECOND 
COMMUNITY ANNOUNCEMENT

In a previous Community Announcement (released April 15, 2016), 
NASA's Science Mission Directorate (SMD) stated its intent to release 
a Program Element Appendix (PEA) to the Stand Alone Missions of 
Opportunity Notice (SALMON-2). This PEA will solicit proposals for 
one instrument investigation to be implemented on the Martian Moons 
eXploration (MMX) mission, which is being developed by the Japan 
Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) for launch in 2024.

Release of this MMX PEA has been postponed. NASA SMD intends to 
release the PEA no earlier than February 1, 2017. The MMX PEA will 
be issued as an appendix to the SALMON-3 notice, which is planned 
for release before that date.

As previously announced, the purpose of the PEA will be to solicit 
proposals for one Principal Investigator (PI)-led science 
investigation involving the development of a Neutron and Gamma-Ray 
Spectrometer instrument, to be integrated with and deployed on the 
MMX spacecraft. Also as previously announced, no other 
investigations or instruments are planned for solicitation in 
this PEA.

Questions:
Dr. Thomas S. Statler

The subject line should consist of the character string "MMX PEA" 
(without quotation marks)
