ASSISTANT PROFESSOR OF GEOLOGY, UNIVERSITY OF GEORGIA
 
The Department of Geology at the University of Georgia seeks to fill a 
position for a tenure-track assistant professor in the field of 
petrology/mineralogy, welcoming applications from scientists in both 
the Earth and Planetary sciences to complement the department's 
growing focus in planetary sciences. We encourage applications from 
petrologists/mineralogists with strong backgrounds in chemistry and 
physics who may employ unconventional and interdisciplinary approaches 
to address big-picture questions including but not limited to 
petrologic and/or mineralogical aspects of planetary evolution 
involving core, mantle, and/or crustal processes. 

The successful candidate must be comfortable teaching our undergraduate 
core curriculum classes in mineralogy and/or petrology, a graduate 
course in their specialty, as well as introductory courses in geology. 
The successful candidate will be expected to establish an externally 
funded research program to attract outstanding graduate students in 
their field, and our core electron microprobe facility with dedicated, 
long-standing technical support may be critical to that effort.

INTERNATIONAL WORKSHOP: IMPACT OF EXOPLANETARY SPACE WEATHER ON CLIMATE 
AND HABITABILITY

The international workshop without walls International Workshop 
entitled "Impact of Exoplanetary Space Weather on Climate and 
Habitability" will be held November 29-December 2, 2016, in New 
Orleans, LA. The major goal of the workshop is to promote 
collaboration between NAI NExSS team members and broader US and 
international communities to discuss recent progress in 
interdisciplinary studies and develop a community roadmap that cross 
the boundaries of space weather from the Sun to cool stars and 
investigate its impact on (exo)planetary climates. This will be 
achieved by bringing together the members of NExSS team who are 
involved in related activities and broader astrophysics, heliophysics 
and planetary science communities.

The workshop will be open to community participation via face-to-face 
attendance, and virtual participation via Adobe Connect.

The 2nd announcement with full agenda (preliminary version) is

COMET WIRTANEN - OBSERVERS' WORKSHOP AT DPS

12:30-2:00   Monday, October 17, Pasadena Convention Center, Room C102

The Comet Group at the University of Maryland is organizing a campaign 
to coordinate observations of Comet 46P/Wirtanen during its 2018 
apparition. To kick off this campaign, we are holding a short 
workshop at the DPS meeting in Pasadena to raise awareness of this 
opportunity, and to assemble participants who may be interested in 
collaborations and coordinated studies, as well as public outreach and 
educational opportunities.

Comet Wirtanen is a small, hyperactive comet with properties similar 
to 103P/Hartley 2, and its orbit makes it a prime potential spacecraft 
target. Wirtanen will be observable for many hours per night for over 
a year around perihelion, coming within 0.077 AU from the Earth on 
December 16, 2018. This offers a unique opportunity to obtain long
duration, high-resolution observations for deriving its physical 
characteristics and behavior. This event also offers the potential 
for mobilizing the amateur observing community to execute otherwise 
difficult-to-achieve science programs.

For more information, contact Tony Farnham (farnham@astro.umd.edu).

[NASA] ADVANCE NOTICE OF IGHAPS PROGRAM
 
ROSES-16 Amendment 36: This amendment creates a placeholder for 
program element C.26 Instruments For Gondola For High-Altitude 
Planetary Science
 
NASA's Planetary Science Division has begun development of the 
stratospheric balloon platform Gondola for High-Altitude Planetary 
Science (GHAPS) intended for use by the broad science community. 
NASA intends to release a new program element for GHAPS science 
instruments through ROSES in early November 2016. The report of the 
science instrument definition team (SIDT), convened to define the 
scope of potential science investigations and derive the science 
requirements and potential instrument concepts for such a platform 
that could address Planetary Science Decadal Survey questions, is 
available on the NSPIRES web page for this program element. A summary 
of that report will also appear in Poster #123.31 at the joint 48th 
meeting of the Division for Planetary Sciences and 11th European 
Planetary Science Congress in Pasadena, California, October 16-21, 
2016. The issuance of this community announcement does not obligate 
NASA to release a program element.
  
Questions concerning this program element may be directed to Rob 
Landis at rob.r.landis@nasa.gov and Kelly Fast at 
kelly.e.fast@nasa.gov.

AAS ORAL HISTORY PROJECT AT THE UPCOMING DPS MEETING IN PASADENA

As part of the ongoing AAS Oral History Project, we are soliciting 
planetary scientists to be interviewed at the DPS meeting in Pasadena, 
CA. We are looking for DPS members from all stages of career from 
undergraduate to emeritus and everything in between. Each interview 
takes about two hours and will become part of an oral history archive 
in partnership with the AIP Niels Bohr Library Oral History Archive. 
Of particular interest to the interviewers are:

- Those involved with astronomy/planetary science education
- Members of "astronomy families," such as dual-career couples, 
  single parents, and astronomers with a parent or child who is also 
  an astronomer (The interviewers would like to speak with the parent 
  or child, too, if possible.)
- Scientists who work in team collaborations
- Instrumentation designers and builders
- Scientists working with big data
- Researchers using small telescopes
