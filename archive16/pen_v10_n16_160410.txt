MAVERICKS LAB: GRAD STUDENT AND POST DOC OPPORTUNITY

The SETI Institute has partnered with NASA HQ, NVIDIA and the Asteroid 
Grand Challenge for a summer research project aimed at pairing young 
planetary scientists with early-career machine learning software 
developers to "hack" various datasets pertaining to the tracking 
and cataloging of NEO's. The idea is to see what can be gleaned 
from such datasets by applying some of the latest developments in 
machine learning to analyze the data in new and innovative ways.

The project is called "Mavericks Lab" and it has its own website at:

http://www.maverickslab.org

We are looking for more applicants to the project from the planetary 
science community, where the target is PhD candidates or postdocs.  
The project will run for ~6 weeks this summer, and will be hosted 
here at SETI Institute. Participants will be housed at dormitories 
at NASA Ames. Applications due April 24.

SMALL BODIES ASSESSMENT GROUP 15TH MEETING: EARLY CAREER TRAVEL SUPPORT

The 15th meeting of the Small Bodies Assessment Group will be help at 
the JHU Applied Physics Laboratory June 28-30, 2016. A draft agenda 
can be found at: 

http://www.lpi.usra.edu/sbag/meetings/jun2016/draft_agenda_20160401.pdf

Early career travel support: We are planning to offer limited U.S. 
travel support for early career scientists to participate in the 
SBAG 15 meeting, to be held at the Johns Hopkins University Applied 
Physics Laboratory June 28-30, 2016. Interested undergraduate students, 
graduate students, postdocs, and other early career scientists (within 
3 years of PhD/MS/BS) should submit a letter and a CV to SBAG Early 
Career Secretary Angela Stickle (angela.stickle@jhuapl.edu) by COB 
(5 pm Eastern time) April 29, 2016. Included in the letter, which 
must not exceed 2 pages, should be a demonstration of financial 
need and an explanation of how the applicant's work relates to the 
purposes of the SBAG. The letter and CV should be combined into a 
single PDF document for submission by e-mail attachment. Recipients 
of travel support will be expected to give a short presentation of 
their SBAG-relevant work at the SBAG 15 meeting.

[NASA] PDS - CASSINI DATA RELEASE 45

The Planetary Data System (PDS) is pleased to announce a new delivery
of Cassini data, Release 45, April to June 2015, for instruments:

* CDA
* INMS
* ISS
* MAG
* MIMI
* RADAR
* RPWS
* RSS
* SPICE
* UVIS
* VIMS

* CIRS, HRD data are not available yet.

The standard RPWS data for this period was previously released. The 
RPWS data in this release are Langmuir Probe products.

Please note that while the data products from this release are 
available online now through the links below, they may not be 
immediately accessible through PDS web services such as the Planetary 
Image Data Atlas. Large data sets may take as long as a few days 
beyond the formal release date to be incorporated into these 
services. Check each service's web site to see the status of the 
latest release.

To access the above data, please visit:

[NASA] SCIENCE MISSION DIRECTORATE SEEKS PUBLIC POLICY EXPERT

Under authority granted to NASA in the NASA Flexibility Act of 2004 
(Pub. L. 108-201, 118 Stat. 461 (5 U.S.C. 9801 et seq.)), the initial 
Intergovernmental Personnel Act (IPA) appointment will be for up to 
two years, with the possibility of reappointment up to a total of 
six years. 

Ideal candidates would have an advanced degree in Public Policy or 
a related field and have multiple years of experience working in 
public policy implementation. All candidates must possess excellent 
policy analysis, writing and editing skills. Prior experience working 
on space policy is desirable, but not required. SMD's preferred start 
date is between August 1, 2016, and September 1, 2016. 

The individual selected would join a six-person team focused on 
providing policy support to SMD's over 100 missions that span 
Astrophysics, Earth Science, Heliophysics, Planetary Science, and 
various reimbursable projects for other agencies. In support of 
SMD's policy functions, the policy team manages SMD's relations 
with external groups, including Congress, the Office of Management 
and Budget (OMB), the Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP), 
educational entities, and external advisory committees and boards. 
In partnership with other SMD Divisions, the policy branch also 
supports the SMD Associate Administrator by providing integrated 
guidance, strategy, and focused advocacy for NASA's science program.

Applicants should forward their resume or Curriculum Vita to 
Dr. T. Jens Feeley at jens.feeley@nasa.gov, preferably on or before 
April 22, 2016.

[NASA] ROSES-16: STEP-1 DUE DATE DELAYED FOR LABORATORY ANALYSIS 
OF RETURNED SAMPLES

The goal of the Laboratory Analysis of Returned Samples (LARS) 
Program is to maximize the science derived from planetary sample-
return missions. Activities supported by LARS fall into two 
categories: 

(1) development of laboratory instrumentation and/or advanced 
techniques required for the analysis of returned samples; 
(2) direct analysis of samples already returned to Earth.

Step-1 proposals are now due on May 2, 2016, and 
Step-2 proposals are still due by June 24, 2016.
