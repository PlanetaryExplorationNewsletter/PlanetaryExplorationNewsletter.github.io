POSTDOCTORAL POSITION IN PLANETARY PHYSICS, JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY

Applications are invited for multiple postdoctoral positions working 
on research topics related to planetary physics (solar system or 
extrasolar) in Prof. Sabine Stanley's group in the Department of Earth 
and Planetary Sciences at Johns Hopkins University. Areas of interest 
include theoretical, observational or computational studies in 
planetary magnetic fields, planetary interior structure and evolution, 
dynamo theory, or other topics where a strong collaboration with Prof. 
Stanley's group is beneficial. In addition to members of the 
Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences, there are also 
opportunities for interactions with planetary scientists at the 
Applied Physics Laboratory and the Space Science Telescope Institute. 
One position will involve spending the majority of time at the Applied 
Physics Lab. The deadline for applications is February 15th, 2017.

SEEKING GRADUATE STUDENTS, NORTHERN ARIZONA UNIVERSITY

We are recruiting excellent undergraduates for our PhD program in 
Astronomy and Planetary Science at Northern Arizona University. Our 
department is rapidly growing, and our new PhD students will join 
students, postdocs, and faculty working on telescopic observations of 
our Solar System and other planetary systems; spacecraft explorations 
of Mars and other bodies in our Solar System; "big data" science, in 
preparation for LSST; and astrophysical laboratory experiments, among 
other topics. We enjoy unparalleled telescope access and rich 
collaborations with neighboring institutions Lowell Observatory and 
the US Geological Survey/Astrogeology Branch.

Flagstaff is a beautiful four seasons mountain town that is surrounded 
by national forest; nearly every kind of outdoor activity takes place 
within minutes of downtown's excellent food/coffee/beer/art scene.

Applications are due January 15, but preference will be given to 
applications that are received by January 1. For more information, 
including list of current faculty and their research interests, as 
well as how to apply to our program, please see

http://www.physics.nau.edu/AstroPhD

Please do not hesitate to contact me or any member of our department 
for additional information. You may also send queries to 
astronomy.grad@nau.edu. We look forward to hearing from you!

CALL FOR PRESENTATIONS FOR THE 3RD 2020 MARS ROVER MISSION LANDING 
SITE WORKSHOP

The 3rd landing site workshop for the 2020 Mars Rover mission will be 
held at the Doubletree Hotel, Monrovia, CA, on February 8-10, 2017. 
Presentations are solicited on the science merits of the eight 
remaining candidate landing sites for the Mars 2020 mission. The full 
second announcement/call for presentations, workshop logistics, and a 
request for registration can be found at:

http://marsnext.jpl.nasa.gov/workshops/wkshp_2017_02.cfm

The primary goal of the third workshop will be to further evaluate the 
eight candidate landing sites that emerged from the second workshop and
reduce the number of candidate sites remaining under consideration to 
three or four. Evaluations at the Workshop will employ the framework 
provided by existing data for Mars (e.g., MRO), the science 
requirements of the 2020 mission, and a better understanding of the 
2020 engineering requirements and traversability of the landing sites 
relative to these requirements. Presenters at the workshop are expected 
to make a comprehensive, persuasive talk on why a specific site is the 
right one for the 2020 mission and payload, including how and where the 
science objectives of the mission can be accomplished.

SECOND ANNOUNCEMENT OF MARS POLAR ICARUS SPECIAL ISSUE

The Scientific Organizing Committee is organizing a special issue of 
Icarus related to Mars Polar research, particularly in the fields of 
polar geology, glaciology, climate record, atmospheric dynamics, 
terrestrial analogs, ground ice, geochemistry, and Mars polar surface 
activity. In recognition of the broad scope, interdisciplinary nature, 
and strong international interest in this topic, we welcome the 
participation of any interested scientist with relevant theoretical, 
experimental, or field experience. This special issue is open to all 
interested authors with Mars Polar related research to publish, 
whether they attended the conference or not. Please email questions  
or notices of intent to guest editors, Adrian Brown (abrown@seti.org) 
and Michael Sori (michael.sori@gmail.com). 

Manuscripts should be submitted through Icarus' EVISE website at: 

https://www.evise.com/profile/#/ICARUS/login

Authors must select "Mars Polar Science VI" when they reach the 
"Article Type" step in the submission process.

POST-DOCTORAL SCIENTIST IN PLANETARY SPACE PHYSICS AT THE SWEDISH 
INSTITUTE OF SPACE PHYSICS IN UPPSALA

This project will investigate the structure and dynamics of Saturn's 
ionosphere and its interaction with the charged dust and plasma near 
its rings. The Cassini mission will end in 2017 with close orbits 
through the ring systems and passages through the upper atmosphere 
and ionosphere of Saturn. The Radio & Plasma Wave Science instrument 
package includes IRF's Langmuir probe. Data from this will be analysed 
in order to study the ring dust and plasma and make the first detailed 
in-situ measurements of Saturn's ionosphere.

Candidates should have completed a PhD in space physics or a related 
field during 2013 or later. Candidates planning to obtain their PhD 
before April 2017 may apply. If the candidate has an older degree and 
wants to refer to special circumstances, this should be clearly 
stated. Candidates should demonstrate experience in spacecraft data 
analysis, as part of national and international collaborations. 
Experience with theoretical modelling is an advantage, as is an 
interest in developing instrumental techniques and methods, and 
experience in coordinating scientific activities.

NASA NEW FRONTIERS PROGRAM AO RELEASED
 
NASA's Science Mission Directorate (SMD) is releasing the Announcement 
of Opportunity (AO) for New Frontiers Program mission investigations. 
The New Frontiers Program conducts Principal Investigator (PI)-led 
space science investigations in SMD's planetary programs under a 
not-to-exceed cost cap for the PI-Managed Mission Cost. At the 
conclusion of Phase A concept studies, it is planned that one New 
Frontiers investigation will be selected to continue into subsequent 
mission phases. New Frontiers Program investigations must address 
NASA's planetary science objectives as described in 2014 NASA 
Strategic Plan and the 2014 NASA Science Plan. Both documents are 
now available at: 

http://science1.nasa.gov/about-us/science-strategy/.

WORKING GROUP ON FINDING SIGNS OF PAST ROCK-HOSTED LIFE

Motivated by the suite of habitable environments available to 
Mars-2020 for in situ exploration and sample collection, we are 
convening a set of 4 web-hosted telecons, open to the community. The 
first two telecons are:

Telecon 1: Martian Environment: Evidence for Rock-Hosted Waters 
What is the evidence for ancient Mars environmental conditions? What 
is the likelihood of habitats for rock-hosted life? 
December 19, 8:30AM PST // facilitated by Bethany Ehlmann, Paul Niles
 
Telecon 2: Metabolisms and Niches for Terrestrial Rock-Hosted Life 
Where rock-hosted life found on earth today? What are its metabolisms 
and products?
December 20, 8:30AM PST // facilitated by Tullis Onstott, Jeff Marlow

The URL for the meeting is:
