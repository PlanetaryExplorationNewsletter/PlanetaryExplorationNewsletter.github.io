PROJECT SCEINTIST POSITION AT NASA MSFC 

The Heliophysics and Planetary Science Office at NASA Marshall Space 
Flight Center anticipates filling a Planetary Scientist civil service 
position within the next several weeks. The candidate will fill a 
project scientist position for the Space Launch System (SLS), 
providing relevant expertise on Solar System destinations for human 
and robotic exploration, and become a part of the MSFC Planetary 
Science group focused on geologic investigation of planets, asteroids, 
and/or moons. We are especially interested in adding capability in 
remote sensing of solid surfaces to complement our existing expertise 
in geochronology and geophysics. The candidate is expected to bring 
or build a strong independent scientific research program through 
peer-reviewed proposals to NASA programs and/or through involvement 
in NASA planetary missions.

All candidates must use the USAJobs website:

USAJobs.gov 

to prepare and submit applications, and United States citizenship is 
required to be eligible. We anticipate filling the position at the 
GS-13 level with a starting date in mid-2016. Formal job posting will 
be announced when available. Informal inquiries can be directed to:
 
Dr. Barbara Cohen 
MSFC Planetary Sciences 
barbara.a.cohen@nasa.gov

GSI SESSION P8: TECTONICS AND IGNEOUS ACTIVITY

The Geological Society of Italy (GSI; founded in 1881) is having 
planetary geology together with terrestrial geology topics in the 
same sessions with the aim of favouring interdisciplinary dialogue 
and collaborations. A complete list of the available sessions, 
conveners and keynote speakers is available for each session can be 
found here:

http://www.sginapoli2016.it/home/index.php/en/2016-01-15-21-14-07/
session-list

The 88th Conference of the GSI will be held in Naples, 7-9 September 
2016, with a rich programme of excursions in the fantastic 
surroundings of the city, including the Vesuvius and the Campi 
Flegrei. All the relevant information can be found here:

http://www.sginapoli2016.it/home/index.php/en/ 

I would like to draw your attention to session P8, which will also 
include planetary volcanism and tectonics. This session will discuss 
the current state of knowledge about the interaction between tectonics 
and igneous activity in different geodynamic settings, with a focus on 
mid-plate settings and subduction zones. We invite contributions from 
a broad range of Earth and planetary scientists, who employ different 
techniques to assess various magma-tectonic processes in ancient and 
recent tectonic settings, and the relationships between volcanism and 
tectonic structures at global, regional or local scale.
 
Best regards,

Giovanni Leone

SUMMER SCHOOL IN SOFTWARE SYSTEMS FOR ASTRONOMY

The University of Hawaii'i at Hilo Physics and Astronomy Department 
offers the two week course (July 25 - August 5). The course covers 
software design and implementation of telescope and instrument control 
systems, observation planning tools, and software for analyzing and 
archiving astronomical data. A full course description and instructions 
for enrollment are given at:

REGISTRATION EXTENSION FOR THE 4TH EUROPEAN LUNAR SYMPOSIUM

The 4th European Lunar Symposium will take place at the Trippenhuis 
(Dutch Royal Academy of Arts and Sciences), Amsterdam, The Netherlands 
on Wed, 18th May and Thu, 19th May, 2016 (pre-registration on the 
evening of Tue 17th May, 2016). 

The registration deadline has been extended to April 29th. Space is 
limited, therefore the organizing committees suggest that you register 
now to insure your participation.

A global surge in lunar exploration has thrust lunar science and 
exploration back into the limelight once again. Current interests in 
the exploration of the Moon range from astronomical, astrophysical, 
geological, commercial, resource utilization, and strategic 
considerations, to its use as an outpost for future human exploration 
of the Solar System. One of the main aims of this meeting is to bring 
together the European scientific community interested in various 
aspects of lunar exploration. In addition, lunar experts from 
countries engaged in launching lunar missions are also invited to 
attend this meeting.

Further information relating to abstract submission, registration etc. 
will be made available via the meeting website which is located at: 

http://sservi.nasa.gov/els2016/

OPAG MEETING - NEW STEERING COMMITTEE MEMBERS SOUGHT

The next OPAG meeting will be August 11-12 at Little America in 
Flagstaff, AZ. If you would like to make a presentation (including 
science nuggets), please contact OPAG chair Alfred McEwen 
(mcewen@lpl.arizona.edu).

OPAG needs five new members for the steering committee because of 
rolloffs from time expiration and other commitments. We will accept 
nominations (including self-nominations) consisting of one paragraph 
about how your involvement will benefit OPAG, plus your CV, sent to 
mcewen@lpl.arizona.edu. The OPAG committee will vote on who to add, 
considering how to maintain balance between science disciplines, 
planetary objects, and institutions, to retain expertise in relevant 
technologies, and to promote diversity.

[NASA] WATER WORLD ADDITIONS TO PICASSO, MATISSE, AND PSTAR AND 
DELAY OF MATISSE DUE DATES

The Planetary Instrument Concepts for the Advancement of Solar System 
Observations (PICASSO) and Maturation of Instruments for Solar System 
Exploration (MatISSE) Programs support the development of spacecraft-
based instruments. Planetary Science and Technology Through Analog 
Research (PSTAR) program supports investigations focused on exploring 
the relevant environments on Earth in order to develop a sound 
technical and scientific basis to conduct planetary research on other
solar system bodies. Amendment 7 adds text to those program elements 
noting that instruments focused on the detection of extant life in the 
"Ocean Worlds" of the outer Solar System are especially of interest 
and will be considered for separate funding from the Outer Planets 
and Ocean Worlds Program.

The due dates for MatISSE have changed. MatISSE Step-1 proposals are 
now due May 20, 2016 and Step-2 proposals are now due July 21, 2016.
 
Questions concerning program element PICASSO may be directed to 
James Gaier (james.r.gaier@nasa.gov).

Questions concerning program element MatISSE may be directed to 
William B. Cook (william.b.cook@nasa.gov).

Questions concerning program element PSTAR may be directed to
Sarah Noble (sarah.noble-1@nasa.gov) or Mary Voytek 
(mary.voytek-1@nasa.gov).

PDS LOLA DATA RELEASE

The Planetary Data System (PDS) announces the release of a new data set
from the LOLA instrument on the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter. The LOLA 
Radiometry (RADR) data set contains along-track profiles of normal 
albedo, the radiance of the Moon at zero phase angle relative to a 
Lambert surface illuminated normally, calculated from LOLA altimetry 
data acquired during the Nominal Mission phase.

LOLA RADR data may be obtained from the PDS Geosciences Node at:
