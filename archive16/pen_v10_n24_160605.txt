VISITING ASSISTANT PROFESSOR POSITION, DEPARTMENT OF GEOLOGY AND
PLANETARY SCIENCE AT THE UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH

The Department of Geology and Planetary Science at the University of 
Pittsburgh is currently advertising for a visiting (non-tenure track) 
assistant professor position with specialties in one or more of the 
following: planetary science, volcanology, igneous petrology and/or 
tectonics. Due to a recent departure of a faculty member, this new 
hire would ideally start in the Fall. Therefore, this is being treated 
as a rapid hire/turn-around.

You can find the details of the position and the application procedure 
here:

Please feel free to contact me or the Chair of the Search committee 
(gpsgrad@pitt.edu) if you have further questions.

Cheers,
Michael Ramsey, Professor

MARTIAN GULLIES WORKSHOP POSTER ABSTRACT DEADLINE MONDAY JUNE 6

We encourage both established Mars-researchers and those new to the 
field to attend. The meeting concentrates on Earth analogues and we 
also have contributions on experimental, numerical modeling and, of 
course, remote sensing studies. Highlights include our invited 
speakers: Bill Dietrich (Berkeley), Alfred McEwen (UofA, HiRISE PI) 
and Anne Mangeney (IPGP). The workshop is focussed on gullies but 
encompasses contributions on associated landforms, such as recurring 
slope lineae (RSL), glacier-like forms, "solifluction" lobes, 
patterned ground, impact craters, dunes, etc. For more details on the 
conference, please see the website!

There are limited places available for (A0 portrait) posters, so please 
send your abstracts by Monday for the second international workshop on 
martian gullies: "Martian Gullies and their Earth Analogues" to be held 
on 20-21 June 2016, hosted by the Geological Society, Burlington House, 
London, UK. Registration is open, so please register for the meeting 
now to secure your place!

WHITE PAPER ON THE VALUE OF PARTICIPATING SCIENCE PROGRAMS ON NASA 
PLANETARY MISSIONS

Dear colleagues,

On behalf of the Assessment/Advisory Groups (OPAG, MEPAG, VEXAG, SBAG, 
LEAG and CAPTEM), we are preparing a white paper about the value of 
Participating Science programs on NASA planetary missions, and how the 
usefulness of such programs might be maximized. This white paper will 
be delivered to NASA and made available to the scientific community. 

To help with the study, we have prepared a survey to gather opinions 
and perceptions about Participating Scientist programs and experiences. 
(Please note, we consider Guest Investigators and Interdisciplinary 
Scientists to also be a type of Participating Scientist). Please 
consider responding to this survey whether or not you have been a 
Participating scientist on a NASA mission. We will be contacting 
mission Principle Investigators and Project Scientists separately about
their experiences, but all are welcome to fill out this survey; please 
answer as many or as few questions as you wish.

EVOLUTION OF CHEMICAL COMPLEXITY: FROM SIMPLE INTERSTELLAR MOLECULES
TO TERRESTRIAL BIOPOLYMERS

Liblice Castle, Czech Republic, 13-15 September 2016
 
The meeting will try to map the chemical evolution of the molecular 
building blocks of life from their possible sources in the interstellar 
medium, the atmospheres of planets and on their surfaces. It also aims 
to serve to engage the astrochemistry and systems chemistry communities 
into a dialogue.

The meeting venue is Liblice Castle, an 18th century castle in a 
wonderful park offers 4 star hotel accommodation, excellent meeting 
facilities in Baroque settings and excellent meals. 

http://www.chateau-liblice.com/
 
The venue is situated only a 30 minutes drive from Vaclav Havel 
airport in Prague. A shuttle service will be provided on the arrival 
and departure days. 

Please note: Bursaries are available for scientists and Ph. D. 
students from countries participating in the European Union COST Action 
"Origins and Evolution of Life on Earth and in the Universe". A list of 
these countries can be inspected at:

http://www.cost.eu/COST_Actions/tdp/TD1308?parties

Deadline for registration and abstract submission is 15 July 2016.

We are looking forward to meeting you in Liblice.

Best wishes,
