AGU 2016 SESSION ED007. CITIZEN SCIENCE WITH BIG DATA: INTERSECTION OF 
OUTREACH, CROWD-SOURCED DATA AND SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH

Abstract due date is 3 August 2016.

Abstracts submitted to an Education session is not counted against 
the one allowed contributed/Invited abstract.

Education
Session ID: 12673  

The traditional method of outreach to formal, informal, science and 
non-science audiences has undergone a fundamental change with recent 
advances in technology, social media and crowd-sourced data, giving 
way to citizen science with many applications. With increasing 
"Big Data" projects, active partnerships between professional, amateur 
and data scientist communities are necessary. Innovative design, 
sustainability and evaluation of these projects is as important as the 
citizen science they generate. This session invites papers from 
scientists, educators and as well as those who design, facilitate, 
evaluate or fund such programs. Topics may include methodology, 
applications of citizen science to enhancing outreach, transformative 
approaches to science education, lessons learned, and the future of 
citizen science. Presentations are invited from all scientific 
disciplines: astronomy, planetary and space science, geology and
geophysics, seismology, biogeoscience, atmosphere and ocean sciences.

AGU 2016 SESSION P007. ENCELADUS: GETTING VERY NEAR THE END

We cordially invite you to submit an abstract to the 11th Special AGU 
Session on Saturn's geysering moon, Enceladus.

Though the very close targeted flybys of Enceladus by the Cassini 
spacecraft at Saturn came to an end in December 2015, Cassini's more 
distant remote-sensing observations of the moon will continue up to 
the mission's finale, slated to occur no later than September 15, 
2017. Consequently, this special AGU session on Enceladus will be 
the last one to occur while Cassini is still active at Saturn.

As in years past, we will focus on the most recent observational, 
theoretical and modeling efforts aimed at assessing Enceladus' 
ocean chemistry, the characteristics and hydrodynamics of its 
geysers, the moon's dynamical and rotational states, its thermal 
and interior structure and evolution, its geological history, as 
well as its astrobiological potential. Presentations on concepts 
for future missions back to Enceladus will also be considered.

AGU 2016 SESSION P009. EXPERIMENTAL PLANETARY GEOCHEMISTRY: 
SIMULATING PLANETARY PROCESSES ON THE MOON, MARS AND OTHER ROCKY 
BODIES IN THE SOLAR SYSTEM

Abstract Deadline is August 3, 2016, 11:59 P.M. EDT

Session ID: 13053

Session Details: Experimentation has been a vital tool in the 
geosciences for many years, helping to advance the fields of 
petrology, mineralogy, and geochemistry. Thanks to successful remote 
sensing and in situ surface investigations, our understanding of the 
composition of planetary bodies has increased immensely. However, 
the origin and evolution of materials in the Solar Nebula, the 
geochemical processes affecting the formation and alteration of rocky 
bodies, and interactions between planetary surfaces, atmospheres, and 
interiors all remain in question. The study of planets, moons, 
asteroids, and meteorites can benefit from experimentation, provided 
that the laboratory conditions (temperature, pressure, volatile load, 
etc.) are relevant to conditions on these bodies. For this session 
we seek researchers interested in sharing their approach to 
laboratory investigations in the planetary sciences which are aimed 
at constraining the processes driving planetary compositional 
evolution.

AGU 2016 SESSION P015. JUNO'S EXPLORATION OF JUPITER AND THE EARTH-
BASED COLLABORATIVE CAMPAIGN

Session ID#: 13297

Session Description:
NASA's Juno mission to Jupiter launched in 2011 and arrived at Jupiter
on July 4, 2016. Juno's scientific objectives include the study of 
Jupiter's interior, atmosphere and magnetosphere with the goal of 
understanding Jupiter's origin, formation and evolution. An extensive 
campaign of Earth based observations of Jupiter and the solar wind 
were orchestrated to complement Juno measurements during Juno's 
approach to Jupiter and during its orbital mission around Jupiter. 
This session provides results from the Juno measurements and the 
collaborative campaign during the early phases of Juno's prime 
mission. Scientific results include Jupiter's interior structure, 
magnetic field, deep atmospheric dynamics and composition, and the 
first in-situ exploration of Jupiter's polar magnetosphere and aurorae.

AGU 2016 SESSION P022. POLARIMETRY AS AN INVALUABLE TOOL TO STUDY 
THE SOLAR SYSTEM AND BEYOND

Abstract due date is 3 August 2016.

Planetary Science
Session ID: 13392
  
Polarimetry is a powerful observing tool and modeling technique, 
providing information about astronomical objects that cannot be 
obtained by traditional photometric/spectroscopic observations. 
Applications include characterization of solar system objects (Sun, 
Earth, planetary atmospheres, aurorae, comets, asteroids, planetary 
satellites/ring systems, dust, etc.) to the detection of exoplanets 
and identification of biological markers in search of habitability. 
Innovative developments in vector radiative transfer theory; 
laboratory measurements, and the increasing significance of non-
sphericity effects on retrieval efforts showcase the importance of 
polarimetric exploration of the solar system and other planetary 
systems. This session is open to papers about observations of solar 
system bodies, theoretical or experimental investigations, 
instrumental developments ground-based facilities or onboard 
future space missions.

AGU 2016 SESSION P030. THE EARLY MARS ENVIRONMENT: WARM AND WET, COLD 
AND WET, OR COLD AND ICY?

We invite contributions from climate modeling, geomorphology, 
geochemistry and mineralogy that address the question of whether 
early Mars climate was "warm and wet", "cold and wet" or "cold and 
icy". This session will focus on both sharing new results from 
different perspectives and fostering communication among the community.

AGU 2016 SESSION SA014. IONIZING RADIATION ENVIRONMENTS THROUGHOUT THE 
SOLAR SYSTEM

We invite contributions to a session focused on the radiation 
environment in the solar system at the 2016 AGU Fall Meeting in San 
Francisco, CA, December 12-16.

Ionizing radiation is an important consideration for both solar 
system exploration and understanding atmospheric and surface processes 
of planets. In addition to exploration, the ionizing radiation 
environment at Earth is an important component to a multitude of 
phenomenon, including understanding the safety concerns of atmospheric 
radiation for aviation and atmospheric chemistry. There has been a 
recent effort to obtain in situ experimental data on the ionizing 
radiation environment throughout the solar system, namely the RAD 
detector on MSL, the SEP instrument on MAVEN, the CRaTER instrument 
on LRO, and multiple experiments flown on both commercial airlines 
and high altitude balloons at Earth. The objective of this session 
is to gather modelers and experimentalists dealing with high energy 
particles in space, on planets, and at Earth.

AGU 2016 SESSION SM016. MAGNETOSPHERES IN THE INNER SOLAR SYSTEM

We invite contributions to an AGU session entitled "Magnetospheres in 
the Inner Solar System" scheduled at the 2016 AGU Fall Meeting 
(December 12-16)

The structure and dynamics of each planetary magnetosphere (intrinsic 
and induced) in the inner solar system are driven by a unique set of 
factors including the nature of its magnetization, atmosphere-
ionosphere coupling, and local solar wind parameters. To provide a 
forum for discussion of recent data analysis and modeling efforts 
concerning the inner planet magnetospheres, this session welcomes 
submissions on the intrinsic magnetospheres of Mercury and Earth, as 
well as the induced magnetospheres of Venus and Mars. It will focus 
on general magnetospheric processes including, but not limited to: 
solar wind-magnetosphere interaction, magnetosphere-ionosphere 
coupling, plasma acceleration and transport, magnetic reconnection, 
wave instabilities, magnetotail dynamics, and bow shock physics. 
We strongly encourage comparative studies of these inner solar system 
magnetospheres with each other or with other planetary magnetospheres 
throughout the solar system.
