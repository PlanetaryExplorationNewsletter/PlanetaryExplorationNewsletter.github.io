EWEN WHITAKER (1922-2016)

Ewen was a British-born astronomer specializing in lunar studies since
1951. During WWII he was part of the secret PLUTO project (Pipe Line 
Under The Ocean) to supply Allied vehicles in France with gasoline 
after the Normandy invasion. After meeting Gerard Kuiper at an IAU 
meeting in Dubline in 1955, he was invited to join the Lunar Project
at Yerkes to produce a high-quality photographic atlas of the moon, 
and subsequently moved with Kuiper to Tucson, Arizona, where this 
project ultimately resulted in the establishment of the Lunar and 
Planetary Laboratory. He provided valuable input into the planning and 
operations of Apollo operations on the Moon. Ewen was much beloved by 
his colleagues and is remembered for his knowledge, friendliness and 
charm.

ANNOUNCING OPENPLANETARY

OpenPlanetary is a bottom-up effort to address the need of the 
planetary science community for sharing ideas and collaborating on 
common planetary research and data analysis problems, new challenges, 
and opportunities. Our goal is to build and sustain an online 
distributed framework and ecosystem enabling open collaborations 
between scientists, engineers, designers, teachers, students, space 
enthusiasts, and citizen scientists. To find our regular blog on topics 
related to planetary data, software, and analyses, and to join the 
ongoing discussion in our Slack forum.

FACULTY POSITION AT ROWAN UNIVERSITY

The School of Earth & Environment at Rowan University is seeking an 
Assistant Professor for the Department of Geology. We seek outstanding 
candidates who hold a Ph.D. (by Sept 1, 2017) in Geology/Geoscience, or 
a closely related discipline. The successful candidate will have 
demonstrated early success at research and publication. Postdoctoral 
experience is desirable. We seek candidates who have a global focus - 
established international collaborations are a plus. The areas of 
expertise are open, however, preference will be given to applicants 
engaged in the following research: nearterm and/or long-term 
paleoclimate studies (biotic or abiotic), sea level science and coastal 
sustainability, geohazards, polar research, Earth systems processes, 
and planetary science in general, however, the science of impacts or 
the dynamical evolution of airless planetary bodies would be of 
particular interest.
