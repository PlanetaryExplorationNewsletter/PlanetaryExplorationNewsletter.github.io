DAP-2017 CALL FOR ABSTRACTS

The Dust, Atmosphere and Plasma environment of the Moon and Small 
Bodies (DAP-2017) workshop will be held at LASP in Boulder, Colorado on 
January 11-13, 2017. The workshop will be a forum to (i) discuss 
current understanding of the surface environment of the Moon, the moons 
of Mars, and comets and asteroids, (ii) share new results from past and 
ongoing missions to airless bodies and comets, and (iii) describe 
expectations for planned upcoming missions to airless bodies and 
comets. The meeting web site is hosted at: 

http://impact.colorado.edu/dap_meeting.html

DAP-2017 is a NASA/SSERVI follow up on two previous NASA/NLSI-SSERVI 
workshops, LDAP-2010 and DAP-2012. Contributions to LDAP-2010 and 
DAP-2012 were published in special issues of Planetary and Space 
Sciences. A similar volume is planned to report the contributions to 
DAP-2017.

The workshop is hosted by M. Horanyi and A. Stern, and supported by 
NASA's Solar System Exploration Research Virtual Institute (SSERVI): 
Institute for Modeling Plasma, Atmospheres, and Cosmic Dust 
(IMPACT), the Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics (LASP), and 
the Center for Integrated Plasma Studies (CIPS) of the University of 
Colorado.

The DAP-2017 abstract deadline is Sept. 30th, 2016; submit your 
abstract to dusty.meetings@gmail.com

A WORKSHOP FOR EARLY-CAREER ASTRONOMERS WHO WANT TO DO BETTER OUTREACH

Tuesday and Wednesday, Jan 3 & 4, 2017 at the start of the American 
Astronomical Society Meeting near Dallas, TX.

The American Astronomical Society is sponsoring a skill-building 
workshop - and an ongoing community - to support early-career 
astronomers (graduate students, post-docs, recent faculty) in doing 
effective outreach to schools, families, and the public. Working with 
the Astronomical Society of the Pacific and other outreach 
organizations, the AAS Astronomy Ambassadors program (now in its fifth 
year) offers you two days of hands-on training, extensive resources and 
pre-tested activities (plus a like-minded group of peers). If you are a 
younger astronomer with an interest in spending a fraction of your time 
helping students or the public become more scientifically literate, 
this is an invitation to join the growing Ambassadors community.

Applications are due by no later than Oct. 17, 2016.

POST-DOCTORAL RESEARCHER AT APL

The Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory (APL) is 
seeking a Post-doctoral Researcher to undertake interdisciplinary 
planetary science research as part of the Space Exploration Sector's 
Planetary Exploration Group.

Job Summary: The successful candidate will engage in research on the
thermal and physical properties of the lunar regolith and polar 
regions. Working with scientists on the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter 
mission, the candidate will analyze data from the Diviner and Mini-RF 
instruments. These data will be compared to other relevant data sets. 
A model will be developed to interpret the results with respect to the 
distribution and stability of volatiles in the lunar polar regions. 
A candidate who has experience in both remote sensing data anlysis 
and computational modeling is especially desired.

Qualifications include a doctorate in geology, planetary science, or
applicable science or engineering field, a strong record of successful
publication of research results, and a demonstrated ability to manage 
time effectively on two or more projects. Familiarity with Diviner or 
Mini-RF data sets and computational modeling is desired.
