3RD INTERNATIONAL WORKSHOP ON INSTRUMENTATION FOR PLANETARY MISSIONS

The 3rd International Workshop on Instrumentation for Planetary 
Missions will be held on October 24-27, 2016, at the Pasadena Hilton in 
Pasadena, California. Note that this is the week immediately following 
DPS and EPSC. The purpose of this workshop is to broadly survey the 
current state-of-the-art and emerging capabilities in instrumentation 
available to future planetary missions. It is also to provide a forum 
for collaboration, exchange of ideas and information, and discussion 
of the instruments, subsystems, and other payload-related technologies 
needed to address fundamental planetary science questions.

PLANETARY INTERIOR STRUCTURE AND DYNAMICS SCIENTIST

Job ID #2016-6584

For full information:

http://Careerlaunch.jpl.nasa.gov/ 

The Jet Propulsion Laboratory invites applications for a full-time 
position in interior structure and dynamics of planets and satellites. 
The applicant will join a broad-based team of scientists and engineers 
to advance JPL's Planetary Science research that excels in applying 
remote sensing data, in-situ measurements and state of the art models 
to planetary geophysics. Determining the interior structure and 
dynamics of planets, moons, and small objects is key to better 
understanding of the formation and differentiation of Solar System 
objects. The scientific scope of interest for this position is broad, 
but candidates should have demonstrated expertise in one of the 
following areas: Modeling of signal propagation in solid bodies and 
atmospheres, with applications, for example, to icy satellites, Mars, 
Venus, and giant planets; Processing of geophysical data, in particular 
seismic signals, over a broad range of frequencies; Material mechanical 
properties and their dependence on several parameters including 
pressure, temperature and forcing frequency; and/or Modeling of 
planetary internal processes. The selected applicant is expected to 
participate in or lead science definition and advancement of new 
science, technology, and mission proposals.  

Applications will be reviewed as they are received.

NEW HORIZONS KUIPER BELT EXTENDED MISSION SCIENCE PLANNING OPPORTUNITY

The centerpiece of the proposed New Horizons Kuiper Belt Extended 
Mission (NH-KEM) is the very close flyby of the 20-40 km wide KBO 
2014 MU69 on 1 January 2019. NH-KEM will also observe ~20 other KBOs 
at phase angles and/or at resolutions not otherwise possible, producing 
a unique database of KBO phase curves, satellite searches, and ring 
searches. 

If NH-KEM is approved, mission schedules require that both distant KBO 
observations and MU69 close flyby planning must begin almost 
immediately.

The New Horizons team plans to use a portion of its September Science 
Team Meeting the week of Sep 19 to gather community input to NH-KEM 
observation plans.

Those are interested in listening to or potentially presenting at 
this activity should complete the indication of interest form at:

POSTDOCTORAL POSITION IN MARS SCIENCE

The Department of Planetology and Habitability at the Centro de 
Astrobiologia (CAB) invites applications for a postdoctoral position to 
support investigations on the nature of the early Mars environments. 
The successful candidate will work with Dr. Alberto Fairen in the 
ERC-funded Project "icyMARS":

https://erc.europa.eu/projects-and-results/erc-funded-projects/icymars

Applicants should have a recent Ph.D. in the field of Planetary Science 
or related discipline, and a background in Mars research. Expertise in 
Geochemistry or Microbiology would be helpful, but not required.

The position, placed in Madrid, would be for two years, with possible 
extension to a third year contingent upon funding availability and 
satisfactory performance. Benefits include working in a young 
enthusiastic team at one of the leading Planetary Sciences institutions 
in Europe, full social benefits according to the Spanish social care 
system, and a very competitive salary.

Applicants should send a letter of interest, a curriculum with a list 
of publications, a brief (maximum two pages) statement of research 
interests, and a list of three references, no later than July 1 2016, 
to Alberto Fairen (agfairen@cab.inta-csic.es).

The starting date is negotiable, but should be no later than Jan 1, 
2017.

SUMMER SCHOOL IN SOFTWARE SYSTEMS FOR ASTRONOMY

The University of Hawai'i at Hilo Physics and Astronomy Department 
offers the two week course (July 25 - August 5). The course covers 
software design and implementation of telescope and instrument control 
systems, observation planning tools, and software for analyzing and 
archiving astronomical data. A full course description and instructions
for enrollment are given at:

[NASA] PDS - MESSENGER DATA RELEASE 15

The Planetary Data System is pleased to announce Release 15 of data 
collected by the MErcury Surface, Space ENvironment, GEochemistry, and 
Ranging (MESSENGER) mission, including the redelivery of calibrated 
products created from data acquired through the end of Mercury orbital 
operations on 30 April 2015, the redelivery of advanced products 
created from data acquired through 17 March 2014, and the delivery of 
advanced products created from data acquired through 30 April 2015. New 
products for this release include additional Mercury maps and digital 
elevation models (DEMs). The products in this delivery reflect improved 
calibrations and corrections as well as the incorporation of 
MESSENGER-derived refined values for Mercury's radius and rotational 
elements and the global DEM.

MESSENGER hosted seven science instruments: Mercury Dual Imaging 
System; Gamma-Ray and Neutron Spectrometer; X-Ray Spectrometer; 
Magnetometer; Mercury Laser Altimeter; Mercury Atmospheric and Surface 
Composition Spectrometer, combining Ultraviolet and Visible Spectrometer 
with Visible and Infrared Spectrograph; and Energetic Particle and 
Plasma Spectrometer, and conducted a Radio Science experiment.
