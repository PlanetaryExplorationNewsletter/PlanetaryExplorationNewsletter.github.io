AGU 2016 SESSION P017: LUNAR AND RECONNAISSANCE ORBITER - SEVEN YEARS 
AT THE MOON

We invite contributions to an AGU session highlighting recent work 
using LRO data.

In over seven years of operation, the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter 
(LRO) has returned a vast quantity of data collected across the Moon. 
These data are revolutionizing our view of fundamental processes that 
operate throughout the Solar System - some that are ongoing today and 
others that are billions of years old. The longevity of LRO has 
uniquely enabled the innovative use of its instrument suite to address 
new questions, including those of contemporary processes (e.g., impact 
cratering, volatile migration) with changes observable by LRO and 
broad implications for other planetary bodies. This session will 
highlight research that makes use of (or otherwise benefits from) 
LRO data.

AGU 2016 SESSION P026: SOLAR SYSTEM SMALL BODIES - RELICS OF FORMATION 
AND NEW WORLDS TO EXPLORE

We would like to invite you to submit an abstract to our session 
entitled "Solar System Small Bodies: Relics of Formation and New 
Worlds to Explore" scheduled at the AGU Fall Meeting at San Francisco, 
December 12-16 2016.

Abstract deadline: 3 August 23:59 EDT/03:59 +1 GMT.

https://agu.confex.com/agu/fm16/preliminaryview.cgi/Session13304

The composition and physical properties of Small Solar System Bodies 
(SSSBs), remnants of the formation of planets, are key to better 
understand our solar system. Increased knowledge of their surface 
properties and their potential as resources are also necessary to 
prepare for robotic and human exploration. Hints about the internal 
structure and composition of SSSBs have been acquired recently thanks 
to flyby/rendezvous data from space missions, study of complex 
multiple asteroid systems, or close encounter between asteroids. This 
session welcomes abstracts on the results bringing information on the 
internal structure and composition of SSSBs based on space and ground-
based data, numerical models, as well as instrument/mission concepts 
in the prospect of future exploration.

AGU 2016 SESSION P030: THE EARLY MARS ENVIRONMENT - WARM AND WET, COLD 
AND WET, OR COLD AND ICY?

We invite contributions from climate modeling, geomorphology, 
geochemistry and mineralogy that address the question of whether early 
Mars climate was "warm and wet", "cold and wet" or "cold and icy". 
This session will focus on both sharing new results from different 
perspectives and fostering communication among the community.

AGU 2016 SESSION EP024: LINKING SEDIMENT TRANSPORT AND GEOPHYSICAL 
FLOWS TO PLANETARY SURFACE EVOLUTION

We invite contributions to session EP024 (details below) at the 2016 
AGU Fall Meeting in San Francisco. The session is cross-listed with 
Planetary Sciences.

Planetary missions over the past decade have revealed that while 
planetary bodies across the solar system differ greatly in surface 
conditions, their landscapes share some striking similarities to 
those on Earth. Understanding the feedbacks between how geophysical 
flows and sediment transport processes affect landscape evolution is 
necessary for constraining the current and past climatic conditions of 
planetary surfaces. We invite contributions from research exploring 
these interplays using remote sensing data from surface or orbital 
missions, numerical modeling, laboratory experiments, Earth analog 
studies, or some combination thereof.

Invited Speakers: Edwin Kite (University of Chicago) and Tjalling 
de Haas (Utrecht University)

Conveners: Marisa Palucis, Alexander Morgan and Orkan Umurhan

AGU 2016 SESSION PP038: REGULATION OF CO2 AND CLIMATE ON EARTH AND 
OTHER PLANETS

We invite contributions to a session focused on the regulation of 
climate on Earth-like planets through the carbon cycle. Submission 
deadline: August 3, 2016.

Session Title: What processes regulate atmospheric carbon dioxide, and 
stabilize climate, on Earth and other planets (Session ID#: PP038)

https://agu.confex.com/agu/fm16/preliminaryview.cgi/Session12973.html

Description: It is generally thought that a negative feedback 
mechanism involving silicate mineral dissolution and carbonate 
precipitation regulates atmospheric carbon dioxide levels on Earth to 
maintain a habitable climate over geologic time. The same is likely to 
be true on rocky exoplanets. However, despite decades of research, 
there is still debate about how this feedback mechanism works. For 
example, the relative importance for carbon dioxide consumption of the 
dissolution of silicate minerals on the continents versus at the 
seafloor is debated, as is the importance of organic carbon burial. 
Similarly, the processes that modify global weathering feedbacks, such 
as changes in lithology at the planet's surface, are poorly 
constrained. This session invites contributions that address our 
understanding of the long-term carbon cycle and climate on Earth and 
other planetary bodies from a diverse range of approaches and time 
periods. Contributions from laboratory, field or modeling studies are 
welcome.
