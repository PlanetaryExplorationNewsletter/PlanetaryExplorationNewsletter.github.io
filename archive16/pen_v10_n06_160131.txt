POST-DOCTORAL POSITION IN PLANETARY MASS SPECTROMETRY

A post-doctoral position is available immediately to work on surface 
induced dissociation of small, neutral molecules. These experiments 
seek to characterize the molecular fragmentation that takes place as a 
spacecraft-based mass spectrometer determines composition of a 
planetary exosphere during a high-velocity flyby. Successful 
applicants will have experience in relevant areas including CID, SID, 
vacuum system hardware and design, GC-MS analysis, ion-molecule 
chemistry, ion activation and dissociation, and cryotrapping. 
Competitive salary is based on experience. To apply, please email cover 
letter and resume to Prof. Daniel Austin, Department of Chemistry and 
Biochemistry, Brigham Young University, Provo, Utah 
(austin@chem.byu.edu).

[NASA] EARTH AND SPACE SCIENCE FELLOWSHIP (NESSF) PROGRAM 2016-2017
ACADEMIC YEAR PROPOSAL SUBMISSION DEADLINE IS EXTENDED

Due to the severe winter weather and blizzard conditions experienced 
in parts of the country and the resultant flooding and other hardship 
conditions, the proposal submission deadline for the subject program is 
being extended to 11:59 p.m. on February 8, 2016.

This change will allow additional proposal preparation time for 
proposers who may have been impacted by these conditions, so that all 
proposers may prepare high-quality, responsive proposals.

Durham, UK

Abstract Deadline: March 4, 2016

* All presenters may submit up to two abstracts.
* A number of travel bursaries will be awarded.
* Prizes will be awarded for outstanding student research 
  presentations.

Please consider submitting full research articles presenting relevant 
and compelling new research to the GCA thematic volume "Highly

EUROPA INITIATIVE WORKSHOPS IN TOULOUSE AND MADRID

NASA's Europa Multiple-flyby Mission is scheduled to launch in the 
2020s to explore the habitability of the moon passing over the moon 45
times while in orbit around Jupiter.

NASA has officially invited ESA to provide a 250-kg class flight
element (TBD) to contribute the mission. Five possible spacecraft 
elements that could constitute an ESA contribution to NASA have been 
identified.

The contributions from the different spacecraft option studies will be
discussed with the Europa Initiative team and the larger scientific
community in a series of initial Europa workshops:

Workshop #2, hosted by IRAP
Toulouse, France 
22-24 February 2016
Go to:

http://europa.sciencesconf.org/ 

Workshop #3, hosted by CAB 
Madrid, Spain 
29 February-01 March 2016
Go to:

http://auditore.cab.inta-csic.es/europa-m5initiative/

We invite the scientific community to contribute to these two
workshops that will produce directions for the preparation of the
Europa proposal to the ESA Cosmic Vision M5 call.

From Michel Blanc (IRAP) and Olga Prieto-Ballesteros (CAB), on 
behalf of the Europa Initiative
