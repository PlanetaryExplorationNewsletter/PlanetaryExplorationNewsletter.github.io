SPECIAL LPSC EVENT NOTICE: THE 2017 NASA BUDGET-THE PLANETARY 
COMMUNITY RESPONSE AND YOUR Q&A

Tuesday, 12:00 to 1:15 p.m., Waterway 6

Was your question left unanswered at NASA Night? Or do you feel that 
an important topic is not being addressed by your professional 
societies? Or do you wonder what the next five years will hold for 
planetary science at NASA? Then come to this special lunch session 
to meet representatives from the American Geophysical Union, Division 
of Planetary Sciences, Geological Society of America, and The 
Planetary Society for an open, frank, and lively discussion about the 
Planetary Science budget problems and possibilities. We will even 
provide a limited number of free drink tickets to encourage further 
discussion. So go ahead and grab an early lunch, bring your friends 
and colleagues, and level-up your knowledge of your field and learn 
how to strategically engage the process to help your field and your 
profession.

SMALL BODIES ASSESSMENT GROUP 15TH MEETING

The 15th meeting of the Small Bodies Assessment Group (SBAG) will be 
held June 28-30, 2016, hosted at APL in Laurel, MD. Some logistical 
details are still being finalized, but a draft agenda is now available 
online:

http://www.lpi.usra.edu/sbag/meetings/

The SBAG 15 meeting is also in the NASA Conference Tracking System, 
with NCTS # 24436-16. If you typically use the NASA Conference 
Tracking System for your travel, or have a different travel 
authorization processes for your institution, please follow those 
usual procedures.

Additionally, the SBAG community has worked to generate an SBAG Goals 
Document over the last year, and the efforts of numerous members of 
the community are very much appreciated. The final SBAG Goals 
Document is now available online:
