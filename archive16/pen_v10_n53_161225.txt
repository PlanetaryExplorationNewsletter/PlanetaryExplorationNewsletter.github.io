LPSC SPECIAL SESSION ON LIPS

Please consider submitting your abstract to the special session on 
Large Igneous Provinces (LIPs) in the Solar System for the 48th LPSC. 
Comparing LIPs on different planetary bodies will provide lively 
discussion, greater understanding, synergy and collaborations. Please 
contact conveners Tracy Gregg (tgregg@buffalo.edu) or Richard Ernst 
(Richard.Ernst@ErnstGeosciences.com) if you have any questions.

LPSC SPECIAL SESSION ON MARS VOLATILE SURFACE-ATMOSPHERE INTERACTIONS:
PAST AND PRESENT

This session will focus on the recent advancements in Mars polar 
science. The exchange of volatiles between the atmosphere and the 
surface is one of the modern climate drivers, and one of the most 
active processes on modern Mars. If one defines the polar regions as 
places with active exchange, then the term "polar processes" includes 
the mid-latitudes and the Tharsis bulge. Both invited and contributed 
abstracts are welcome.

LPSC Planetary Polar Processes and/or Cryospheres.

In addition to the Mars Special Session, there is also the more 
general "Planetary Polar Processes and/or Cryospheres." In the past, 
this session has mostly attracted abstracts from the Mars and Mars 
Analog communities. We encourage the use of this session topic for 
all planetary bodies that have cryospheres - especially those icy 
bodies in or past the Main Asteroid Belt.

Abstract Deadline:  Tuesday, January 10, 2017
(5:00 p.m. U.S. Central Standard Time, GMT-6)

[NASA] PDS - MARS EXPLORATION ROVERS DATA RELEASE 50

The Planetary Data System (PDS) is pleased to announce Release 50
of Mars Exploration Rover data. This release includes data primarily
from Sols 4321 through 4410, rover Opportunity (MER1/B), instruments:

APXS
Atmospheric Opacity
HAZCAM
NAVCAM
MI
PANCAM
RAT
Rover Motion Counter
SPICE

There is no Radio Science data in this release, and no more Mini-TES
or Moessbauer data is expected.

PLANETARY GEOMORPHOLOGY AT EGU 2017

Abstract deadline 11th Jan.

Once you have turned in your LPSC abstract(s), get thinking about EGU! 
The Planetary Geomorphology session GM1.4/PS9.5 at EGU2017 (Vienna 
Austria 23-28 April) welcomes abstracts concerning landforms and the 
processes that shape them on all solar system bodies. Earth analogue 
studies, flume/simulation work and novel approaches using remote 
sensing data are especially encouraged. This session has always 
provided a stimulating forum for cross-disciplinary discussion and we 
hope you'll join us once again to bring geomorphology and planetary 
science closer together. This year we welcome Prof. Michael Lamb from 
Caltech as our invited speaker!

[NASA] RFI FOR LIFE DETECTION CHALLENGE

NASA has released a Request For Information seeking input on a 
potential new Centennial Challenge. The Centennial Challenges program 
is seeking input on a life detection challenge proposed to start in 
2017. The challenge focuses on building and demonstrating a scientific 
instrument capable of detecting evidence of Earth-type life in a small 
(10 mL) liquid sample provided to the instrument. The RFI is available 
at:
