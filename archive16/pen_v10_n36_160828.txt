CALL FOR ABSTRACTS TO PRE 8

The 8th International Workshop on Planetary, Solar and Heliospheric 
Radio Emissions (PRE 8) deals with the most recent developments in the 
study of non-thermal radio emissions from the Sun, the radio planets, 
the heliosphere, and from extrasolar sources like exoplanets or brown 
dwarfs. Special emphasis is put on current spacecraft missions (Juno, 
Cassini, Van Allen Probes etc.), but also new developments in ground-
based radio telescopes will be matters of discussion, which should 
lead to a better coordination of ground- and space-based radio 
observations.

PRE 8 is the continuation of a series of workshops that took place 
in Graz in 1984, 1987, 1991, 1996, 2001, 2005 and 2010. PRE 8 will 
take place October 25-27, 2016, in the conference hotel "Schloss 
Seggau", which is located about 30 km south of Graz near the town of 
Leibnitz in Austria.

For more information please visit our website at:

Registration and abstract submission are already open. The abstract 
deadline is on 5 September 2016.

The organizing committee looks forward to your abstract submission.

[NASA] SOLAR SYSTEM EXPLORATION RESEARCH VIRTUAL INSTITUTE CYCLE 2 
CAN RELEASED
 
Step-1 Proposal Due: September 23, 2016
Step-2 Proposal Due: November 21, 2016
  
NASA is announcing an opportunity for submission of multiinstitutional 
team-based proposals for research as participating members of SSERVI. 
Proposals must clearly articulate an innovative, broadly based research 
program addressing basic and/or applied research fundamental to 
understanding the nature of the Moon, Near Earth Asteroids (NEAs), the 
Martian moons, and their near space environments to enable eventual 
human exploration. Nondestination targets may provide critical 
information relating to origin and evolution of the proposed target 
bodies; therefore, comparative planetary investigations that include 
comets and/or main-belt asteroids are within the scope of this CAN 
provided the prime focus is on the Target Body(s). Proposed research 
that complements current Institute Teams, or addresses important 
research areas not currently covered in the Institute, will also be 
given strong consideration. Proposals in astrophysics and heliophysics 
that are enabled through human and robotic exploration of Target Bodies 
are also solicited through this CAN. 

The full text of the CAN may be found by going to:

VENUS EXPLORATION GOALS, OBJECTIVES, AND INVESTIGATIONS DOCUMENT UPDATE

The Goals, Objectives, and Investigations for Venus Exploration were 
recently updated to improve consideration of space physics and 
aeronomy. These changes are focused in Goals I.A.1 and I.A.2, with 
accompanying narrative on page 6. Community comments are solicited. 

The updated document can be accessed on the Venus Exploration Analysis 
Group (VEXAG) web site:

[NASA] ROSES-16 AMENDMENT 25: C.24 HOTTECH RELEASED
 
The Hot Operating Temperature Technology (HOTTech) program supports 
the advanced development of technologies for the robotic exploration 
of high-temperature environments, such as the Venus surface, Mercury, 
or the deep atmosphere of Gas Giants. The goal of the program is to 
develop and mature technologies that will enable, significantly 
enhance, or reduce technical risk for in situ missions to high-
temperature environments (approaching 500 degrees Celsius or higher). 
It is a priority for NASA to invest in technology developments that 
mitigate the risks of mission concepts proposed in response to 
upcoming Announcements of Opportunity and expand the range of science 
that might be achieved with future missions. Note that this HOTTech 
program element is not soliciting hardware for a flight opportunity. 
HOTTech is limited to high temperature electrical and electronic 
systems that could be needed for potentially extended in situ missions 
to such environments.

Notices of Intent due date: September 28, 2016, 
Proposal due date: November 23, 2016.
 
This Amendment to the NASA Research Announcement "ROSES 2016" 
(NNH16ZDA001N) will be posted on the NASA research opportunity 
homepage:

PLANETARY SCIENCE SLIDES AND ILLUSTRATIONS

Are you looking for some great slides or illustrations to use in your 
presentations? The Planetary Science Research Discoveries website has 
sets of Powerpoint slides. These are summaries of PSRD articles 
covering planetary science, including the processes by which planets, 
moons, and small bodies form and evolve. The slides are annotated with 
captions and notes, and are linked to PSRD articles that provide the 
full context, additional graphics, and references. New content added 
monthly. Use our search box to find just what you need.

http://www.psrd.hawaii.edu/Archive/Archive-PSRDpresents.html

The Cosmochemistry Illustrated website offers additional Powerpoint 
slides with planetary examples to enrich geochemistry, petrology, and 
introductory geology lectures. References and background are given in 
the notes pages.

POST-DOCTORAL POSITION FOR THE ANALYSIS OF VIRTIS/ROSETTA DATA

A 2-year post-doctoral position in cometary science is opened at the 
Observatory of Paris (LESIA, CNRS, Meudon), beginning in fall 2016.

The successful applicant will analyze infrared spectra of the 
atmosphere of comet 67P/Churyomov-Gerasimenko obtained with the 
high-spectral resolution channel of the VIRTIS/Rosetta instrument 
(Visible Infrared Thermal Imaging Spectrometer) built at the 
Observatory of Paris. The project will focus on the study of the 
distributions of H2O and CO2 gases and their variations to understand 
the processes that control cometary activity. Other topics of 
interest could be considered.

A PhD in astrophysics is required. The following skills will be 
considered in the evaluation process of the applicants:
- working knowledge in planetary science and comets
- expertise in reduction of infrared spectroscopic observations
- knowledge in radiative transfer
- previous experience in space missions, in particular Rosetta, 
  is an asset.

Applicants should submit a CV with a publications list, a short review 
of previous works and statement of research interest. They should 
arrange for two reference letters. Applications should be sent via 
email to dominique.bockelee@obspm.fr. The closing date is 25 September 
2016. Late applications can be considered, until the position is 
filled.

REGISTRATION OPEN FOR SSB SEARCH FOR LIFE WORKSHOP

The Space Studies Board of the National Academies of Sciences, 
Engineering, and Medicine is hosting a workshop and poster session to 
explore the current status of activities to detect extraterrestrial 
life in the solar system and extrasolar planetary systems. The 
workshop will feature presentations from experts on the environmental 
limits of life, habitable environments in the solar system and beyond, 
extraterrestrial biosignatures, and life detection techniques and 
instrumentation.

The workshop will take place at the Beckman Center in Irvine, CA on 
December 5-6, 2016.  To register as a poster presenter or participant 
and learn more about the workshop, please visit:

ABSTRACT DEADLINE EXTENDED FOR MINI-SYMPOSIUM ON ASTEROIDS

http://www.stardust2013.eu/Training/Conferences/StardustFinal
Conference/Asteroids/tabid/5541/Default.aspx

New Deadline: 5th September 2016

The mini-symposium on asteroids will be organized during the Stardust
Final Conference, to be held at the ESA-ESTEC (The Netherlands), 31st
October - 4th November, 2016. The mini-symposium will take place over 
two days (31st Oct & 1st Nov), and will focus on small solar system 
objects, mainly asteroids. It will consist of two half-day sessions, 
aiming to review the state-of-the-art of the corresponding lines of 
research, as well as to present ongoing projects, and to discuss 
directions for the future developments.

As there have been major advances in asteroid science in the last 
decade, and that trend continues, we think it is an appropriate time 
for such a meeting. Moreover, we want to incorporate manuscripts 
reporting the results of new research from the field into a single 
special journal issue, expecting that this will increase the impact 
and visibility of these papers. For these reasons we have made 
arrangements with the journal ICARUS for the publication of a special 
issue on asteroids, associated with the mini-symposium.
