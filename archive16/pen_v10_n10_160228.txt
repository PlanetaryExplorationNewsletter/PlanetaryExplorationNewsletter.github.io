Polarimetry is a currently enjoying a rejuvenation in various 
astronomical applications. As a complementary technique to imaging 
and spectroscopy, polarization allows the investigation of 
scattering properties of variety of media ranging from planetary 
atmospheres, comets, small bodies (planetary satellites, asteroids, 
Kuiper Belt objects, etc.) to detection and characterization of 
exoplanets, brown dwarfs, star and planet forming regions; 
characterization of magnetic fields and search for optically active 
molecules in a search for habitability elsewhere than our earth. We 
invite contributions from observers, modellers, laboratory 
measurements, instrument designers and missions. We anticipate half 
to one day of presentations including oral and poster contributions.

AOGS 2016 SESSION PS-08: SOLAR SYSTEM PRIMITIVE BODY EXPLORATION 
MISSIONS 

Asia Oceania Geosciences Conference 2016
July 31 – Aug 5, Beijing, China

Conference website: 

http://www.asiaoceania.org/aogs2016/public.asp?page=home.htm

This session welcomes abstracts about the results from all past and 
ongoing small body missions by combining multiple missions, as well as 
new concepts for future missions. Solar system small bodies are 
considered the best-preserved fossils from the early era of planetary 
systems formation. Small body exploration missions have tremendously 
revolutionized our understanding of the formation of the planetary 
system with their paradigm changing results. In the context of past 
and current missions, such as Dawn, Rosetta, Stardust-Next, EPOXI, Deep 
Impact, NEAR, Giotto, and VEGA, as well as missions such as Hayabusa2, 
en route to its target, OSIRIS-REx, in development and possibly Lucy, 
Psyche, AIDA, and the Japanese Trojan asteroid mission, it is now 
time to both combine the mission results to enhance scientific returns 
of these missions and to develop concepts for future small body 
explorations. Abstract submissions are open until March 4, 2016.

AOGS2016 SESSION PS-09: PLANETARY SCIENCE DATA ARCHIVING
 
Asia Oceania Geosciences Conference 2016
July 31 – Aug 5, Beijing, China

Conference website: 

http://www.asiaoceania.org/aogs2016/public.asp?page=home.htm 

The focus of this session is planetary science data archives, archiving 
activities, and future plans. We invite contributed abstracts related 
to all aspects of planetary science data archiving activities and 
concepts  and will invite speakers from the major data archiving 
organizations from various space agencies to discuss their facilities 
and activities. It is of great importance and broad community interest 
to archive and make available to the public the data returned by 
planetary science exploration missions and related data from Earth-
based observatories. The ultimate goal is to enable and facilitate 
combined scientific analyses using data covering long time-baselines 
and multiple observations for new phenomena and scientific objectives 
emerging in the future. This session provides a forum for researchers 
in planetary sciences to discuss and understand the standards, 
approaches, current progress, and future plans and concepts for 
effective long-term planetary science data preservation. Abstract 
submissions are open until March 4, 2016.

AOGS 2016 SESSION PS-13: COMMUNICATING THE EXCITEMENT OF SPACE 
EXPLORATION TO AUDIENCES IN YOUNG SPACE-FARING NATIONS
 
Asia Oceania Geosciences Conference 2016
July 31 – Aug 5, Beijing, China

Conference website:

http://www.asiaoceania.org/aogs2016/public.asp?page=home.htm

Abstract submission deadline: extended to March 4, 2016
 
Recent years have seen growth in the number of nations that are 
conducting spacecraft missions for planetary science, space science, 
and astronomy. China, India, and Japan have flown successful lunar 
and planetary missions. Korea and Russia also have plans to enter or 
re-enter the arena of space exploration. A challenge for countries 
with youthful space exploration programs is to engage their citizens 
and communicate an appreciation of the value and excitement of space 
exploration. This session will highlight education and public outreach 
(EPO) programs, strategies, and technologies, with emphasis on 
developing countries and nations that are relatively new to space 
science and exploration. We also welcome presentations that describe 
outreach programs that have been successful in the U.S., Europe, or 
elsewhere.

AOGS 2016 SESSION PS-15: ROLE OF SMALL BODIES IN THE FORMATION OF THE 
SOLAR SYSTEM: FROM INTERPLANETARY DUST TO PLANETARY MOONS

Solar system small bodies, ranging from dust particles to primitive 
bodies (asteroids, comets, minor planets, KBOs) and planetary moons 
and ring systems present targets for future exploration. Results from 
recent missions such as NASA/New Horizons to Pluto and now enroute to 
a KBO, ESA/Rosetta mission to comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, NASA/
DAWN mission of Vesta and Ceres, ESA/Gaia, and new missions such as 
JAXA/Hyabusa2 mission to an asteroid, NASA/Europa Clipper mission, etc. 
illustrate the importance of studying these objects and their role in 
the formation and evolution of the solar system. Given their location, 
composition and evolution, we have windows into the inventory of the 
early solar system. The asteroid-comet spectrum; discovery of rings 
around Centaurs; jets from planetary satellites are examples of large 
diversity that exists in our solar system. We invite presentations 
(oral and poster; invited, reviews and contributed) covering the broad 
themes of observations, models, laboratory measurements, 
instrumentation, missions, and related outreach and Citizen Science 
activities.

Abstract submission deadline: extended to March 4, 2016
 
Session Description: Recent years have provided us with many new 
insights on both the Moon and Mercury. In the past the Moon was often 
considered as a Mercury analog. Now we know that this view is true 
only to a limited extent. However there are many similarities between 
these two bodies, and the differences allow us to learn more about 
airless bodies in the Solar System in general. Therefore we invite 
contributions to this comparative session. In addition to comparative 
presentations, contributions that focus on just one of these bodies 
are welcome.
