NASA'S ASTROPHYSICS INVESTMENTS WEBSITE FOR THE PLANETARY SCIENCE 
COMMUNITY

Jim Green, Director, Planetary Science Division, NASA
Paul Hertz, Director, Astrophysics Division, NASA

NASA's Astrophysics Missions are available for the use of the entire 
science community to advance important science objectives independent 
of which NASA Division manages the programs. The planetary science 
community has benefited from both using the tools and science derived 
from NASA's astrophysics investments. This has been occurring for a 
long time and we want to highlight this great relationship that our 
two disciplines have continued to develop over the years. We truly 
believe that the collaboration benefits both scientific disciplines 
and furthermore, that the best insights come from interdisciplinary 
interactions between many scientific fields. 

With the goal of engaging the planetary community in taking part in 
further potential observations from astrophysics missions and 
continued astrophysics collaborations, we held workshops at the 
Division of Planetary Science (DPS) meeting through a collaboration 
of the Astrophysics and Planetary Science Divisions. As a result, and 
with the goal of providing continuous information to the community, we 
are creating a website that would keep updates about the missions 
proposals schedules as well as links to white papers and 
presentations that would help our community.
 
Please visit: 

http://www.lpi.usra.edu/astrophysicsassets/ 

We plan to archive the presentations given at our workshops and keep 
an updated calendar relevant to our community. 

This website is not meant to replace the missions websites, but 
to provide as much as possible, a portal for our community interested 
in using those investments.

It is quite apparent that we have been experiencing a renaissance 
of planetary science using astrophysics missions. We deeply 
appreciate how these two communities of scientists have started to 
work together in understanding the origin and evolution of our Solar 
System and all the diversity of objects within. When we look at the 
sky at night, we now know that the stars we see have solar systems 
similar to our own. This is the new paradigm that has drawn us more 
closely together.
