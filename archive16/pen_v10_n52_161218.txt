ASSISTANT PROFESSOR OF GEOLOGY, UNIVERSITY OF GEORGIA

The Department of Geology at the University of Georgia seeks to fill 
a position for a tenure-track assistant professor in the field of 
petrology/mineralogy, welcoming applications from scientists in both 
the Earth and Planetary sciences to complement the department's 
growing focus in planetary sciences. We encourage applications from 
petrologists/mineralogists with strong backgrounds in chemistry and 
physics who may employ unconventional and interdisciplinary 
approaches to address big-picture questions including but not limited 
to petrologic and/or mineralogical aspects of planetary evolution 
involving core, mantle, and/or crustal processes.

The successful candidate must be comfortable teaching our 
undergraduate core curriculum classes in mineralogy and/or petrology, 
a graduate course in their specialty, as well as introductory courses 
in geology. The successful candidate will be expected to establish an 
externally funded research program to attract outstanding graduate 
students in their field, and our core electron microprobe facility 
with dedicated, long-standing technical support may be critical to 
that effort.

EGU 2017 SESSION ON PLANETARY PLASMA PHYSICS AND INTERACTIONS IN THE 
SOLAR SYSTEM

Please consider submitting an abstract to the session PS5.1/ST2.7
Planetary Plasma Physics and Interactions in the Solar System of the 
EGU General Assembly to be held 23-28 April 2017, in Vienna, Austria:

http://meetingorganizer.copernicus.org/EGU2017/abstractsubmission

The abstract submission deadline is 11 January 2017, 13:00 CET. 

The emphasis of the session is on all aspects of planetary plasma 
physics and interactions in the Solar System, including:
(a) magnetospheres, ionospheres, auroras
(b) the solar wind interaction with planets, moons, asteroids and 
    comets
(c) plasma interactions with exospheres, dust and surfaces (e.g. at
    Mercury, Europa, Ganymede, our Moon, etc.)
(d) intercomparisons of planetary environments

Contributions are welcome which address previous (e.g. CHANDRAYAAN-1,
KAGUYA, VENUS EXPRESS, MESSENGER,ROSETTA), present (e.g. CASSINI, 
MARS EXPRESS, MAVEN, CHANG'E 2,JUNO), forthcoming (e.g. BEPI COLOMBO) 
and planned (e.g. JUICE) observations from space. Analyses of ground-
based observations of neutral and ionized environments are welcome. 
Theoretical modelling and simulations are also strongly encouraged, 
both in themselves and as a basis for intercomparisons and 
interpretation of measurements. Laboratory studies on planetary 
analogues aiming to simulate the surface-plasma interaction are 
considered as well.

[NASA] ROSES-16: THE ASTROPHYSICS RESEARCH AND ANALYSIS PROGRAM

The Astrophysics Research and Analysis Program (APRA) program solicits 
basic research proposals for investigations that are relevant to 
NASA's programs in astronomy and astrophysics and includes research 
over the entire range of photons, gravitational waves, and particle 
astrophysics. Awards may be for up to four yearsâ€™ duration (up to 
five years for suborbital investigations), but shorter-term proposals 
are typical; four-year or five-year proposals must be well justified. 
Proposals for suborbital investigations are particularly encouraged. 
APRA investigations may advance technologies anywhere along the full 
line of readiness levels, from Technology Readiness Level1 (TRL1) 
through TRL9. The emphasis of this solicitation is on technologies 
and investigations that advance NASA astrophysics missions and goals, 
including those missions being studied for the next decadal survey.

Amendment 50 makes a number of changes throughout Section 1.2, and 
in particular a new paragraph has been added to 1.2.1.2. In addition, 
some of the points of contact have changed in the Summary Table of 
Key Information. New text is in bold, deleted text is struck 
through. The due dates remain unchanged.
