PHD OPPORTUNITIES WITH THE DESERT FIREBALL NETWORK

Curtin University, Perth, Australia

The Desert Fireball Network team at Curtin University are seeking two 
PhD candidates (fully funded) to work within the team to analyse the 
massive dataset. Potential projects include, but aren't limited to:

* Statistical analysis of asteroidal material arriving at 1 AU;
* Fireball modelling;
* Probabilistic orbital dynamics of meteorites (and their parent 
  asteroids);
* Tracking space debris;
* Fitting orbital and compositional data into an overall model of the 
  compositional structure of the Solar System.

There will be opportunities to become involved in all other areas of 
the project, including meteorite recovery in Australia, and sample 
analysis.

More information about the Desert Fireball Network is available on the 
website:

description at: 

http://meetingorganizer.copernicus.org/EGU2016/session/21463

The session will host two invited talks: 

- Geomorphology of ice stream beds: recent progress and future 
  challenges, by Chris Stokes (University of Durham); and

- Eskers and other evidence of wet-based glaciation in Phlegra Montes,

26TH GOLDSCHMIDT CONFERENCE MOON SESSION

We would like to make you aware of our Moon-session at the 26th 
Goldschmidt Conference that will take place in Yokohama, Japan between 
the 26th June and 1st of July, 2016. Information about Session 2g 
(Lunar Evolution: Endogenous and Exogenous Processes) may be found at:

http://goldschmidt.info/2016/program/programViewThemes

This session aims to combine lunar geochemistry, geophysics, 
thermodynamics, chronology and impact flux data, in order to enhance 
our understanding of heterogeneity in the lunar crust and mantle, the 
bulk composition of the Moon, as well as the crust and mantle 
morphologies associated with impact basins. The convergence of 
knowledge on endogenous and exogenous processes that shaped up the 
Moon can help us better understand the early processes of planetary 
differentiation and evolution in general. 

Abstract submission will open on January 1st and end on February 26th. 

Wishing you all happy Festivities and a great 2016!

at a hotel near Pasadena California. Details about the class and the 
registration form are available here:  

http://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/naif/WS2016_announcement.html

The class is designed for professionals working in the field of solar

on the SPICE tutorials, and student-executed programming lessons 
("open book" style), available in each of the four programming 
languages supported by NAIF (Fortran 77, C, IDL and Matlab). 

There is no charge for the class, but advance registration is 
required... the sooner, the better. The 60 seats available will be 
allocated only upon NAIF receiving a completed registration form. 
Allocation will be done on a first come, first served basis.

The objective of the workshop is to bring together international
experts from different fields of Titan's research in order to have
an overview of the current understanding, and to determine the 
remaining salient scientific issues and the actions that could be 
implemented to address them. PhD students and post-doc researchers are 
welcomed to present their studies. This conference aims to be a 
brainstorming event leaving abundant time for discussion during oral 
and poster presentations.

[NASA] DRAFT ANNOUNCEMENT OF OPPORTUNITY (AO) FOR NEW FRONTIERS PROGRAM
TO BE RELEASED

NASA has released a community announcement as an advance notice of its 
plan to release a Draft Announcement of Opportunity (AO) for New 
Frontiers Program mission investigations with a target release date of 
July 2016. The New Frontiers Program conducts Principal Investigator 
(PI)-led space science investigations in SMD's planetary programs under 
a not-to-exceed cost cap for the PI-Managed Mission Cost (PMMC). At the 
conclusion of Phase A concept studies, it is planned that one New 
Frontiers investigation will be selected to continue into subsequent 
mission phases. The full text of the announcement, including important 
anticipated AO parameters and schedule, is available on at the New 
Frontiers Program Acquisition website:

DEADLINE APPROACHING FOR PLANETARY GEOMORPHOLOGY AT EGU 2016

Vienna, Austria 
17-22 April 2016  
GM7.1/PS9.3

Please note that the deadline for EGU abstracts is just 13 hours after 
the LPSC deadline, namely 13:00 CET 13th January 2016. Late abstracts 
will be heavily penalised this year. The Planetary Geomorphology 
session welcomes abstracts concerning landforms and the processes that 
shape them on all solar system bodies. Earth analogue studies, 
flume/simulation work and novel approaches using remote sensing data 
are especially encouraged. This session has always provided a 
stimulating forum for cross-disciplinary discussion and we hope you'll 
join us once again to bring geomorphology and planetary science closer 
together.

COSPAR/ISECG WORKSHOP ON SCIENCE ENABLED BY HUMAN EXPLORATION

CNES HQ, Paris 
Feb 10/11 2016

Participating space agencies of the International Space Exploration 
Coordination Group (ISECG) have teamed with the COSPAR Panel for 
Exploration to organize a workshop on the scientific benefits from the 
ISECG Global Exploration Roadmap.

The GER provides insights into agencies' exploration planning for 
potential future human exploration, post-ISS.

In preparation for next version of the GER, a Science White Paper has 
been in development that articulates and promotes the scientific 
opportunities of the proposed mission themes. The scientific content 
of the document has been prepared by representatives of the 
international scientific communities and has been openly discussed at 
a number of events.

The COSPAR/ISECG workshop participants will review and discuss 
appropriate overarching science themes for exploration of the lunar 
surface, a cislunar habitat, and asteroids, as well as the 
opportunities of early human-robotic missions. The recommendations 
of the workshop will directly feed into the ISECG Science White Paper 
and inform the development of the next version of the GER.

Workshop details can be found at:

AOGS 2016 SESSION PS22 - CALL FOR ABSTRACTS

Dear colleagues,

We invite you to submit an abstract to the following session of the 
13th Annual Meeting of the Asia Oceania Geosciences Society (AOGS) 
held in Beijing, China, 31 July to 05 August 2016:

PS22: Isotope Ratios Across The Solar System: Origin And Evolution Of 
Planetary Bodies

"Isotope Ratios across the Solar System" Session will address recent 
advances in isotope compositions and ratios in different Solar System 
objects and reservoirs. Isotopes in the Solar System display temporal 
and sun-distance location heterogeneities. Isotope composition and 
ratios of planetary bodies (planets, satellites and primitive bodies) 
convey a unique record of the processes that formed the Solar System 
and planetary bodies. Their tracers and ratios constituye a powerful 
diagnostic tool and offer a key to reconstruct the physical and 
chemical conditions of the early solar system and to unravel the 
complex dynamics and chemistry associated with the formation and 
evolution of planetary bodies. Scientific investigations include, but 
are not limited...

Please visit the AOGS Annual Meeting site:

Deadline for abstract submission is 19 February 2016.
