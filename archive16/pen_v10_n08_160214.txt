NASA AMES APPLIED RESEARCH ACCELERATOR: MAVERICKS LAB

Mavericks Lab is looking for Planetary Scientists, with a passion for 
data science, to join peers in machine learning to develop breakthrough 
applications for planetary defense. 

The program will be hosted at NASA Ames and SETI in Silicon Valley 
for 6 weeks this summer, where three teams will work in parallel 
mentored by senior experts from both academia and the private sector.  

Mavericks Lab is an experimental new tool in NASA's innovation 
portfolio that places emphasis on inter-disciplinary approaches, 
rapid iteration and teamwork to bridge knowledge gaps useful to the 
Space Program - in this case the Asteroid Grand Challenge.  

In this inaugural Mavericks Lab, participants and mentors will be 
invited to work on solutions within the following themes: 

1. New Tools 

e.g. Feature Net
A Machine Learning Tool for Removing False Positives  

2. New Approaches 

e.g. Lost Wolves
Alignment of Astrometry of New Observed Objects and Objects 
From Archived Surveys

3. New Discoveries  

e.g. Fall Finding
Radically Increasing the Number of Found Meteorite Falls 
Using Machine Vision and Drones

Applications for this year's Mavericks Lab are now open:

DEBRIS CIVIL SERVANT OPENING

Civil servant Space Scientist position in the field of orbital debris 
research to characterize the debris environment for the NASA Orbital 
Debris Program Office.

Duties include:

Coordinates and develops theory and computer models, e.g. (1) that 
relate measured orbital debris data to physical characteristics of 
objects generated in space as a result of dynamic events such as 
explosions or collisions spacecraft, or from the slow degradation 
of satellite surfaces, (2) that characterize the current and future 
debris environment. Test models against measurement and laboratory 
data to resolve differences and reduce model uncertainties.

Desired Qualifications/Experience:

(1) Orbital mechanics (e.g. collision evolution; restricted n-body 
    problem; non-gravitational forces on the orbits of small objects). 
(2) Designing, planning, and coordinating complex scientific 
    experiments. 
(3) Knowledge of spacecraft vulnerabilities from the micro meteoroid 
    and orbital debris environment. 
(4) Remote sensing (radar and optical) and in situ measurements to 
    characterize the orbital debris environment.

Advanced degree or equivalent experience in the physical sciences or 
mathematics is strongly preferred. U.S. Citizenship required.

AOGS2016 SESSION PS-08: SOLAR SYSTEM PRIMITIVE BODY EXPLORATION 
MISSIONS

Asia Oceania Geosciences Conference 2016
July 31 - Aug 5, Beijing, China
Conference website: 

http://www.asiaoceania.org/aogs2016/public.asp?page=home.htm

Abstract submission deadline: February 19, 2016

This session welcomes abstracts about the results from all past and 
ongoing small body missions by combining multiple missions, as well 
as new concepts for future missions. Solar system small bodies are 
considered the best-preserved fossils from the early era of planetary 
systems formation. Small body exploration missions have tremendously 
revolutionized our understanding of the formation of the planetary 
system with their paradigm changing results. In the context of past 
and current missions, such as Dawn, Rosetta, Stardust-Next, EPOXI, 
Deep Impact, NEAR, Giotto, and VEGA, as well as missions such as 
Hayabusa2, en route to its target, OSIRIS-REx, in development and 
possibly Lucy, Psyche, AIDA, and the Japanese Trojan asteroid 
mission, it is now time to both combine the mission results to 
enhance scientific returns of these missions, and to develop 
concepts for future small body explorations.  

Conveners: Jian-Yang Li (Planetary Science Institute, United States),
Makoto Yoshikawa (JAXA, Japan), Lucy McFadden (NASA Goddard Space 
Flight Center, United States), Sebastien Besse (ESA, Spain), 
Liang Chang (Yunnan Observatory, China)

AOGS2016 SESSION PS-09: PLANETARY SCIENCE DATA ARCHIVING

Asia Oceania Geosciences Conference 2016
July 31 - Aug 5, Beijing, China
Conference website: 

http://www.asiaoceania.org/aogs2016/public.asp?page=home.htm

Abstract submission deadline: February 19, 2016

The focus of this session is planetary science data archives, 
archiving activities, and future plans. We invite contributed 
abstracts related to all aspects of planetary science data archiving 
activities and concepts and will invite speakers from the major data 
archiving organizations from various space agencies to discuss their 
facilities and activities. It is of great importance and broad 
community interest to archive and make available to the public the 
data returned by planetary science exploration missions and 
related data from Earth-based observatories. The ultimate goal is 
to enable and facilitate combined scientific analyses using data 
covering long time-baselines and multiple observations for new 
phenomena and scientific objectives emerging in the future. This 
session provides a forum for researchers in planetary sciences to 
discuss and understand the standards, approaches, current progress, 
and future plans and concepts for effective long-term planetary 
science data preservation.

ASTRONOMY EDUCATION PROJECT INFORMATION REQUEST

My name is Molly Simon and I'm a 3rd year graduate student at the 
University of Arizona working with Dr. Chris Impey on an astrobiology/
planet formation education project. If you teach an astrobiology 
course for non-majors and could send me your syllabus and the list of 
topics you teach in the course that would be great!

Additionally, if you teach planet formation in any course (not just 
astrobiology) if you could provide me with a short explanation as to 
how you teach it (Powerpoint slides, videos etc...) I would greatly 
appreciate it!

molly.simon1203@gmail.com

Thank you!
