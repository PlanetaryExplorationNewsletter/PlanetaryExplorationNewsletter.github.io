4TH EUROPEAN LUNAR SYMPOSIUM

May 18 - May 19

The 4th European Lunar Symposium will take place at the Trippenhuis 
(Dutch Royal Academy of Arts and Sciences), Amsterdam, The Netherlands 
on Wed, 18th May and Thu, 19th May, 2016 (pre-registration on the 
evening of Tue 17th May, 2016).

A global surge in lunar exploration has thrust lunar science and 
exploration back into the limelight once again. Current interests in 
the exploration of the Moon range from astronomical, astrophysical, 
geological, commercial, resource utilization, and strategic 
considerations, to its use as an outpost for future human exploration 
of the Solar System. One of the main aims of this meeting is to bring 
together the European scientific community interested in various 
aspects of lunar exploration. In addition, lunar experts from countries 
engaged in launching lunar missions are also invited to attend this 
meeting.

The format will consist of both oral and poster presentations divided 
into four broad themes of: "Science of the Moon", "Science on the 
Moon", "Science from the Moon" and "Future Lunar Missions".

Further information relating to abstract submission, registration etc. 
will be made available via the meeting website which is located at:

LINKING EXOPLANET AND DISK COMPOSITIONS

Workshop at the Space Telescope Science Institute, Baltimore MD, USA

Dates: September 12-14, 2016

This workshop will gather scientists working on the compositional 
characterization of planets and planet-forming regions in 
protoplanetary disks. Recent and upcoming advancements make it timely 
to have a round-table conversation among the communities involved, to 
join forces in tackling our most compelling questions on the origins 
of exoplanet diversity. Do exoplanet compositions retain the imprint of 
large-scale disk processes? Do disks include compositional trends that 
imprint planets? What do we learn in this context from observations of 
Solar System bodies? And what can we test with observations of disks 
and exoplanets in the near future? We intend to identify long-lasting 
and observable links between exoplanet and disk compositions, to help 
the community in shaping ongoing modeling efforts as well as the 
essential parameter space to cover with existing and upcoming 
observatories for exoplanet and disk characterization.

Pre-registration and abstract submission are now open:

NASA's Science Mission Directorate is recruiting reviewers for ROSES 
proposals to Astrophysics and Planetary Science. If you are interested 
in being a reviewer, please go to: 

http://science.nasa.gov/researchers/volunteer-review-panels/ 

We especially encourage post-doctoral fellows and other early career 
scientists to volunteer. The following programs are currently listed: 
Astrophysics Data Analysis, Exoplanets Research, Emerging Worlds, Solar

2016 NASA PLANETARY SCIENCE SUMMER SCHOOL APPLICATIONS OPEN

NASA is accepting applications from science and engineering post-docs, 
recent PhDs, and doctoral students for its 28th Annual Planetary 
Science Summer School, which will be held July 25-29, 2016 at the Jet 
Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif.

During the program and pre-session webinars, student teams will carry 
out the equivalent of an early mission concept study, prepare a 
proposal authorization presentation, present it to a review board, and 
receive feedback. By the end of the session, students will have a 
clearer understanding of the life cycle of a space mission; 
relationships between mission design, cost, and schedule; and the 
tradeoffs necessary to stay within cost and schedule while preserving 
the quality of science.

Applications are due April 6, 2016. Partial financial support is 
available for a limited number of individuals. Further information is 
available at: 

http://pscischool.jpl.nasa.gov

THIRD INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON THE EXPLORATION OF PHOBOS AND DEIMOS

July 18-19, 2016 at NASA Ames Research Center

The Third International Conference on the Exploration of Phobos and 
Deimos, subtitled The Science, Robotic Reconnaissance, and Human 
Exploration of the Two Moons of Mars, will be an open international 
forum gathering scientists, engineers, space exploration professionals 
and students interested in discussing the status and advancement of 
the exploration of Mars' natural satellites, the investigation of 
other small bodies in relation to Phobos and Deimos, the exploration of 
Mars itself via its moons, and the importance of exploring these moons 
for Solar System science.

The conference is being convened at a time of growing interest in the 
exploration of Phobos and Deimos, with several international robotic 
spacecraft missions and concept studies underway, in particular in 
Europe, Japan, Russia, and the United States. Important new scientific 
data relating to Phobos have also been obtained recently by NASA's 
Mars Atmosphere and Volatile EvolutioN (MAVEN) mission and ESA's Mars 
Express (MEX) mission. The human exploration of Phobos and Deimos is 
also under serious consideration in the international context of the 
Global Exploration Roadmap.

The deadline for submission of abstracts is Tuesday, 19 April 2016, 
5:00 pm Pacific Daylight Time.
