VENUS TARGETS WORKSHOP REPORT POSTED ON VEXAG WEBSITE

Over fifty scientists from around the world participated in a Venus 
Exploration Targets Workshop held May 19-21, 2014 at the Lunar 
Planetary Institute. Their goal was to identify key targets for future 
exploration of Venus and to evaluate their potential for answering the 
fundamental questions posed in VEXAG's Venus Exploration Goals, 
Objectives and Investigation document and other reports. Science 
targets for the surface, atmosphere and from space were identified. A 
Final Report from that Workshop is now available at the VEXAG website:

Users will be asked about their current or previous participation as a 
PI, Co-PI, Program Director, or Co-Program Director in federally

BARRINGER GRANT APPLICATIONS FOR 2016 NOW BEING ACCEPTED

This year's application deadline for grants from the Barringer Family 
Fund for Meteorite Impact Research is April 8, 2016. This program 
provides three to five competitive grants each year in the range of 
$2500 to $5000 USD for support of field research at known or suspected 
impact sites worldwide. Grant funds may be used to assist with travel 
and subsistence costs, as well as laboratory and computer analysis of 
research samples and findings. Masters, doctoral, and post-doctoral 
students enrolled in formal university programs are eligible. Over the 
past 14 years, 51 research projects have been supported.

The Barringer Family Fund for Meteorite Impact Research has been 
established as a memorial to recognize the contributions of Brandon, 
Moreau, Paul, and Richard Barringer to the field of meteoritics and 
the Barringer family's strong interest and support over many years in 
research and student education. In addition to its memorial nature, 
the Fund also reflects the family's long-standing commitment to 
responsible stewardship of The Barringer Meteorite Crater and the 
family's steadfast resolve in maintaining the crater as a unique 
scientific research and education site.
