WORKSHOP: DUST, ATMOSPHERE AND PLASMA ENVIRONMENT OF THE MOON AND 
SMALL BODIES (DAP-2017)

The Dust, Atmosphere and Plasma environment of the Moon and Small 
Bodies (DAP-2017) workshop will be held Jan 11-13, 2017 in Boulder, 
Colorado, to discuss our current understanding of the surface 
environment of the Moon, the moons of Mars: Phobos and Deimos, and 
asteroids, to share new results from past and ongoing missions, and 
to describe expectations for planned upcoming missions. The workshop 
will be focused on the open science questions, the status and future 
of our supporting modeling and laboratory experimental capabilities, 
the definition of the required measurements and instrument 
capabilities for future investigations from orbit, or to be 
deployed on the surface.

OPEN PLANETARY ASTRONOMY POSITION

The Chester F. Carlson Center for Imaging Science at the Rochester 
Institute of Technology invites applicants for a tenure track assistant 
professor position in the Digital Imaging and Remote Sensing Laboratory 
(DIRS). We are seeking candidates whose research expertise and 
knowledge in the remote sensing field will complement the existing 
and well-established expertise within DIRS in passive and active 
electro-optical systems, data exploitation, modeling and simulation, 
and environmental applications. Areas of complementary expertise of 
interest include, but are not limited to, unmanned aerial systems, 
synthetic aperture radar, and deep learning. Individuals working in 
the field of planetary remote sensing will be considered. The 
successful candidate will be expected to advise graduate students, 
teach graduate level remote sensing courses and undergraduate courses 
relevant to imaging science, and develop an externally funded research 
program. More information on the activities of the DIRS group can be 
found at:

LINKING EXOPLANET AND DISK COMPOSITIONS

Workshop at the Space Telescope Science Institute, Baltimore MD, USA

Dates: September 12-14, 2016

This workshop will gather scientists working on the compositional 
characterization of planets and planet-forming regions in 
protoplanetary disks. Recent and upcoming advancements make it 
timely to have a round-table conversation among the communities 
involved, to join forces in tackling our most compelling questions 
on the origins of exoplanet diversity. Do exoplanet compositions 
retain the imprint of large-scale disk processes? Do disks include 
compositional trends that imprint planets? What do we learn in 
this context from observations of Solar System bodies? And what 
can we test with observations of disks and exoplanets in the near 
future? We intend to identify long-lasting and observable links 
between exoplanet and disk compositions, to help the community in 
shaping ongoing modeling efforts as well as the essential parameter 
space to cover with existing and upcoming observatories for exoplanet 
and disk characterization.

Abstract submission will begin on March 26, 2016 through the link

OBSERVATION CAMPAIGN OF KBO TARGET FOR PROPOSED NEW HORIZONS FLYBY

Having completed its successful flyby of the Pluto system, the New 
Horizons spacecraft is on a trajectory to encounter Kuiper Belt 
Object 2014 MU69. Pending NASA approval for an extended mission, 
New Horizons will also take advantage of being an observing platform 
in the outer solar system to observe a select number of other KBOs 
having favorable geometries for resolved or high signal-to-noise 
measurements.

Earth-based observations can support these pending New Horizons 
measurements through calibrated photometry at low phase angle (Earth), 
which will be complementary to the higher phase angle data from the 
spacecraft. In particular for objects having the potential for 
resolved imaging from the spacecraft, knowledge of the rotational 
phase at the time of the New Horizons observations can help constrain 
the overall shape of these distant objects.

An Earth-based campaign website in support of the pending science 
from the New Horizons extended mission is under construction at: 

http://www.boulder.swri.edu/nh-support-obs/kbo

Available there now is a table listing the pending targets having 
the highest priority for supporting observations. Register on that 
page to indicate interest.

[NASA] ROSES-2016 PLANETARY SCIENCE PROGRAM OVERVIEW CLARIFIED

In C.1 the Planetary Science Research Program Overview Section 3.5.2 
on Data Archiving in the Planetary Data System (PDS) contained 
contradictory language, in one place indicating that proposers 
"should" and in another case that proposers "must" communicate with 
and obtain a letter from a PDS Discipline Node. The text has 
been clarified to indicate that "Proposals must demonstrate an 
understanding of the work involved in preparing data for the PDS" 
but that inclusion of a letter from Planetary Data System Discipline 
Nodes is not mandatory. New text is bold and deleted text is struck 
through.

COMETS 2016 - FIRST ANNOUNCEMENT

An international conference on cometary science entitled "Comets: A 
new vision after Rosetta/Philae" will be held November 14-18, 2016, 
at the Abattoirs Museum in Toulouse, France. The conference is 
principally organized by the teams involved in the Rosetta mission, 
the European Space Agency (ESA), the French Space Agency (CNES) and 
the Institute of Research in Astrophysics and Planetology (IRAP). 
Toulouse is famous for its aeronautics and space industry, its 
gastronomy and its history dating back to the Roman empire.  

A general press conference on the Rosetta mission will be organized 
at CNES on Monday morning. The 46th Rosetta Science Working Team 
technical session will be held on Wednesday. A convivial dinner is 
scheduled on Tuesday night. Optional mid-conference visits will be 
organized on Wednesday and Thursday. Additional details about the 
program, will be included in the second and third announcements.

One goal of this meeting is to generate a comprehensive global 
understanding of comets that will serve as an important resource 
for future studies. Reports on the discussions of the conference 
will be published at a later time.

LPSC: MARSSI USER WORKSHOP

When: Wednesday 03/23/2016 12:00-13:15
Where: Room Shenandoah

MarsSI (Acronym of MARS System of information) is a web Geographic 
Information System application which allows the managing and 
processing of Martian orbital data. From this application, the 
users are able to easily and rapidly select observations, to process 
raw data via proposed automatic pipelines and to get back final 
products which can be visualized under Geographic Information Systems 
like ARCGIS and QGIS. Also, MarsSI proposes automatic stereo-
restitution pipelines to produce Digital Terrain Models (DTM) 
from CTX and HIRISE stereo pairs. This application is part of 
the ERC project e-Mars founding from the European Union's Seventh 
Framework Program (FP7/2007-2013) (ERC Grant Agreement No. 280168). 
This tool is also part of Portail of Planetary Surfaces (PSUP) 
founded by the french national research agency (CNRS).
