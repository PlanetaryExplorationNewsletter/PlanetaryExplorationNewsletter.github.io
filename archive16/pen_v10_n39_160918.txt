NASA JSC CURATOR POSITION (REPOSTING)

The Astromaterials Acquisition and Curation Office at the NASA Johnson 
Space Center is reposting a position in the field of geomicrobiology 
or astrobiology. Qualified candidates who applied previously are 
encouraged to re-apply. 

The successful candidate will serve NASA as curator for biological 
components in astromaterials. We seek an individual with expertise in 
at least one of the following areas: 

(1) biological cleanliness and quantitative biological contaminant 
characterization; 

(2) chemical, mineralogical, or petrological consequences of microbial 
interaction with astromaterials, astromaterials simulants, and 
terrestrial analogs of astromaterials; 

(3) sample collection and handling (including transport, containment, 
preservation, and curation) of geological materials that contain 
microbial matter. 

The successful candidate should have a Ph.D. and at least 2 years of 
relevant post-graduate experience, and a demonstrated record of 
contributions to the field. The candidate shall develop an externally 
funded research program in the area of geomicrobiology and/or 
astrobiology. This individual will also provide expertise in the area 
of contamination knowledge as it relates to biological cleanliness of 
NASA spacecraft at all stages of a mission. A complete description of 
the position is posted at USAJobs at: 

http://www.usajobs.gov/GetJob/ViewDetails/450322000

Applications due: 10/5/2016

[NASA] INTENT TO RELEASE A CAN FOR THE NASA ASTROBIOLOGY INSTITUTE
 
The NASA Science Mission Directorate Planetary Science Division intends
to release a Cooperative Agreement Notice (CAN) soliciting team-based 
proposals for membership in the NASA Astrobiology Institute (NAI) in 
January 2017. Step 1 proposals will be due around March 15, 2017, and 
Step-2 proposals will be due in early June 2017.
 
The NASA Astrobiology Institute (http://astrobiology.nasa.gov/nai/) 
was established in 1998 as an institution of scientific collaboration 
across disciplines, across organizations, and within and among its 
participating Teams irrespective of their geographic distribution. 
 
The goal of this CAN (Cycle-8) is to maintain a multidisciplinary 
institute by selecting focused, interdisciplinary teams that 
compliment without replicating the strengths of the continuing teams. 
The teams selected this cycle will replace the teams selected in 
Cycle 6 and it is anticipated that the number of teams selected in 
Cycle 8 will be about the same number selected in Cycle-6 (five 
teams).
 
Further information will be posted through the NSPIRES system at: 

http://nspires.nasaprs.com
 
Questions and comments related to this announcement should be 
addressed to Mary Voytek, NASA Astrobiology Institute Program 
Scientist, Science Mission Directorate, NASA Washington DC 20546 
(E-mail: mary.voytek-1@nasa.gov).

[NASA] ROSES DATA ANALYSIS PROGRAM
 
Advance notice is given that C.25 Rosetta Data Analysis Program will be 
solicited as part of ROSES-2017.
 
The objective of the Rosetta Data Analysis Program (RDAP) will be to 
enhance the scientific return of the Rosetta mission and broaden the 
scientific participation in analysis of archived data collected from 
the Rosetta and Philae spacecraft.
 
The proposal due dates will be released with ROSES-2017, but the 
Planetary Science Division expects to schedule the Step-1 and Step-2 
proposal due dates of RDAP to coincide with those of the Discovery 
Data Analysis Program (DDAP), and expects that RDAP proposals will 
be co-reviewed at the same time as DDAP proposals. However, RDAP 
awards will be funded from a source other than the Discovery Program. 
NASA expects to make approximately ten RDAP awards.
