2016 PIERAZZO INTERNATIONAL STUDENT TRAVEL AWARD

Application deadline: 9 PM PST, November 30, 2016

Awards will be announced on or before December 9, 2016

This award is established by the Planetary Science Institute in memory 
of Senior Scientist Betty Pierazzo to support and encourage graduate 
students to build international collaborations and relationships in 
planetary science. Two awards will be made each year, contingent upon 
there being meritorious applications. One will be awarded to a graduate 
student working on his or her Ph.D. at an institution within the U.S. 
This is to support travel to a planetary science related meeting 
(conferences and workshops) outside of the U.S. The second award will 
be to a graduate student working on his or her Ph.D. at an institution 
outside of the U.S. This is to support travel to a planetary science 
related meeting within the U.S. These include general meetings that 
have planetary-focused sessions such as the AGU, GSA, EGU and IAG.

The award will consist of a certificate and up to $2000US.

AGU SCIENCE POLICY ALERT: APPLICATION OPEN FOR CONGRESSIONAL SCIENCE 
FELLOWSHIP

AGU is accepting applications for the 2017-2018 AGU Congressional 
Science Fellowship program at:

http://sciencepolicy.agu.org/congressional_fellows/

The fellowship offers scientists the opportunity to work in the field 
of science policy in Washington, D.C. The two AGU-sponsored fellows 
attend an intensive two-week course on politics and the legislative 
process run by the American Association for the Advancement of Science 
(AAAS) before spending one year in either the personal office of a 
senator or representative or on a House or Senate committee in the 
U.S. Congress. Fellows serve as staff members in their assigned 
offices, and their responsibilities may include writing legislation, 
preparing for congressional hearings, meeting with lobbyists and 
constituents, and more.

The fellowship carries a stipend of $68,000, as well as health 
insurance, moving expenses, travel to the 2017 AGU Fall Meeting, 
and a work-related travel allowance.

The application period opens 1 November 2016, and all submissions 
are due by 1 February 2017. For more information on the fellowship, 
application requirements, and past fellows, visit the website above.

AGU members are also eligible for the Congressional Science 
Fellowship sponsored by American Geosciences Institute

advances, measurements, and applications. The specific topics that 
will be covered include (but not limited to) the following:

- new theoretical developments, numerical simulations, and laboratory 
  measurements of light scattering by nonspherical and morphologically 
  complex particles and particle groups;
- detection and characterization of atmospheric particulates using 
  laboratory, in situ, and remote sensing techniques;
- scattering of light by aerosols, clouds, and oceanic particulates;
- scattering of light by solar system objects, exoplanets, and 
  exoplanetary environment and various astrophysical objects;
- light scattering in densely packed particulate media.
