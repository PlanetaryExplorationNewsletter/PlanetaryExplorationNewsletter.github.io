PLANETARY AND SPACE SCIENCE SPECIAL ISSUE REMINDER

Dear colleagues,

We remind you about the Special Issue on "Space Weather at the 
Terrestrial Planets" in the Planetary and Space Science journal, whose 
submission deadline is October 1st 2016.

The covered topics will include all aspects of planetary plasma physics 
and interactions in the inner Solar System, e.g.:
(a) magnetospheres, ionospheres, auroras
(b) the solar wind interaction with planets (Mercury, Venus, Earth, 
    Mars) and their moons, or with asteroids / comets
(c) plasma interactions with exospheres, dust and surfaces
(d) intercomparisons of planetary environments

Contributions that address previous, present, forthcoming and planned 
observations from space, as well as ground-based observations, 
theoretical modelling or simulations are welcome. Laboratory studies 
on planetary analogues aiming to simulate the surface-plasma 
interaction will be considered as well.

Regular papers are expected, and the usual refereeing process will be 
applied for publication in PSS. To ensure that all manuscripts are 
correctly identified for inclusion into the special issue, it is 
important that authors select the name of the special issue when 
they upload their manuscripts: "Planetary space weather."

Best regards,
A. Milillo, A. Radioti, P. Garnier and N. Ganushkina

ANNOUNCEMENT OF A SPECIAL ISSUE OF ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH ON SMALL 
BODY SCIENCE AND EXPLORATION

Papers are invited for a special topical issue of Advances in Space 
Research (ASR) entitled "Past, Present and Future of Small Body 
Science and Exploration" that was proposed within the 41st COSPAR 
2016 Scientific Assembly.

This special issue is open to all scientists that want to share 
their results with the scientific community about small body science 
connected to space exploration. The year 2016 has seen an incredible 
burst in the Space mission activities to minor bodies, leading to 
tremendous or surprising results. The present special issue welcomes 
contributions that have a Scientific, Technical or Instrumental
focus and serves as a crossroad of recent results and future 
prospects of small body explorations.

Papers must be submitted electronically to:

http://ees.elsevier.com/asr

To ensure that all manuscripts are correctly identified for inclusion 
into the special issue, authors must select "Special Issue: Small 
Body Exploration" when they reach the "Article Type" step in the 
submission process. The deadline for submissions is 31 January 2017.

Questions can be directed to Drs. Palomba, Hestroffer or to the 
Co-Editor for Special Issues, Dr. Peggy Ann Shea (sssrc@msn.com).

Solar System as well as exoplanets, including theory, observation, 
and instrumentation. However, we are especially interested in 
individuals whose research complements existing MIT expertise. 

Applicants must hold a Ph.D. in Planetary Science or related field 
by the start of employment and must demonstrate ability to excel in 
teaching. A complete application must include curriculum vitae, 
two-page description of research and teaching plans and three 
letters of recommendations.

BIG DATA CHALLENGES, RESEARCH, AND TECHNOLOGIES IN THE EARTH AND 
PLANETARY SCIENCES

http://geo-bigdata.github.io/

Part of IEEE International Big Data Conference 2016, Washington D.C.
Monday, December 5th, 2016

Paper submissions due September 25th, 2016

A new paradigm is needed in order to increase the productivity and 
effectiveness of scientific data analysis for Earth and planetary 
science investigation. This paradigm must recognize that architectural 
and analytical choices are interrelated, and must be carefully 
coordinated in any system that aims to allow efficient, interactive 
scientific exploration and discovery to exploit massive data 
collections, from point of collection to analysis and decision support.

Both observational systems and data centers will be needed as part 
of this new paradigm, which includes the significant increase in size 
and complexity of science data as well as new approaches across the 
entire data lifecycle from capture to management and analysis of 
the data.

This workshop builds off of two successful previous workshops that 
have merged to offer a comprehensive venue for all aspects of Big 
Data in the Earth and Planetary Sciences. We seek computational and 
data science experts to present on their research and discuss Big Data 
roadmaps, architectures, technologies, and methodologies for future 
Earth and planetary science data challenges emerging from both 
instrumentation and data access and analytics.

MAPSIT

MAPSIT, the Mapping and Planetary Spatial Information Team, is a new 
NASA Assessment Group that is seeking steering committee membership, 
including international. We consider all aspects of planetary data, 
from collection, to processing, to incorporation into regional and 
global products and maps, and finally to storage and accessibility. 
We seek to identify and prioritize community needs and to increase 
the utility of our international spacecraft data. We will accept 
nominations (including self-nominations) consisting of one paragraph 
about how your involvement will benefit MAPSIT, plus your CV, sent 
to janirad@byu.edu by 30 September 2016. The MAPSIT steering committee 
will decide between these nominations, considering how to retain 
expertise in tools and methods and to maintain balance between 
science, disciplines and institutions. Visit:

http://www.lpi.usra.edu/mapsit/ 

for more information on MAPSIT.

ELSI 5TH INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM & YOUNG RESEARCHERS DAY 

The Earth-Life Science Institute will be holding its 5th International 
Symposium on the 11-13 Jan 2017, on the broad topic of the emergence 
of the biosphere. We welcome interested scientists to join this 
discussion.

The emergence of biosphere on Earth, and possibly elsewhere in the 
universe, remains one of the great unsolved scientific questions. 
Research into the origin and subsequent evolution of life takes 
place across an array of scientific disciplines, including but not 
limited to planetary sciences, astronomy, theoretical physics, 
chemistry and biology. The goal of the Symposium is to provide a 
forum for diverse perspectives and unify the fragmentary knowledge 
stemming from a single discipline. Accordingly, the program features 
talks and discussions aimed at understanding the nature of life, 
constraints of habitability, early Earth environments, systems 
chemistry, structure and attributes of early life.

On 10 Jan 2017, will be the Young Researcher Day (YRD), a workshop 
for early career investigators to present and discuss their work, 
and for which we offer a number of full or partial travel grants.

NSRC Community,

We want to call attention to this meeting and special session that 
may be of interest to members of the NSRC community. Conference 
information and abstract submission at:

www.aeroconf.org. 

Disregard the July 1 date in the Call for Papers, the conference 
organizers have told us that abstracts are still being accepted.

IEEE Aerospace Conference
Big Sky, Montana
March 4-11, 2017

Session 8.14 - New Technologies and Instruments for Scientific 
Balloon Missions. Scientific balloons are capable of testing new 
technologies and performing groundbreaking science for low cost. 
Topics include mission concepts (astrophysical, planetary, and 
terrestrial), instrument, sensor and infrastructure technologies 
(e.g., gondola mechanical structures, pointing/aspect systems, 
payload networking, data streaming techniques, power management 
schemes, and ground station operation enhancements and architectures) 
and cross-over technologies relevant for future orbital and deep 
space payloads.  Also of interest are specific electronic 
developments related to long duration and ultra-long duration 
balloon flights, as well as related technologies applicable to 
balloon systems, testing, and performance.
