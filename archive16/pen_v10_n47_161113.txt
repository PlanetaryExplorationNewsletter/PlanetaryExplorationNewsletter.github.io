2016 PIERAZZO INTERNATIONAL STUDENT TRAVEL AWARD

Application deadline: 9 PM PST, November 30, 2016

Awards will be announced on or before December 9, 2016

This award is established by the Planetary Science Institute in memory 
of Senior Scientist Betty Pierazzo to support and encourage graduate 
students to build international collaborations and relationships in 
planetary science. Two awards will be made each year, contingent upon 
there being meritorious applications. One will be awarded to a graduate 
student working on his or her Ph.D. at an institution within the U.S. 
This is to support travel to a planetary science related meeting 
(conferences and workshops) outside of the U.S. The second award will 
be to a graduate student working on his or her Ph.D. at an institution 
outside of the U.S. This is to support travel to a planetary science 
related meeting within the U.S. These include general meetings that 
have planetary-focused sessions such as the AGU, GSA, EGU and IAG.

The award will consist of a certificate and up to $2000US.

POST-DOCTORAL RESEARCH ASSOCIATE POSITION IN COMET OBSERVATIONS AT THE 
OPEN UNIVERSITY, UK

This part-ESA funded position will combine preparation of observational 
data on comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko for archiving at the ESA 
Planetary Science Archive, with research on cometary science. The 
research direction is flexible within the broad topic of comet science, 
and will depend on the interests of the successful candidate, but is 
expected to make use of (and/or build on) the same observations of 67P. 
Possible topics include the large-scale structure of the comet's coma 
and tails, its composition, and/or comparison with other comets - in 
all cases, comparing between remote observation and Rosetta 
instrument results. The research could also involve further 
observations (based on new proposals) or work with Rosetta instrument 
teams. There will be a roughly 50-50 split between research and 
functional duties. The duties encompass collation and documentation 
of data from various observatories, working with observers to ensure
that data is properly reduced, and interaction with the ESA PSA to 
have it archived in a useful way alongside spacecraft data. 

Closing date for applications is 29 Nov 2016.

NEW COSMIC DUST DATA SET: WIND SPACECRAFT DUST IMPACT DATABASE

This announces the public release of the Wind/WAVES dust impact 
database on NASA's CDAWeb and the ftp/http directories at NASA's Space 
Physics Data Facility (SPDF).

It was recently discovered that the Wind/WAVES electric field 
instrument has been detecting interplanetary and interstellar dust at 
1 AU for over 20 years through hypervelocity impact ionization of dust 
grains on the spacecraft surface.

This nearly unexplored data set has the potential to enable new 
advances in the study of cosmic dust in the heliosphere.

The Wind Spacecraft Dust Impact Database has been created to make the 
Wind dust data easily accessible to the heliophysics community. The 
database contains over 107,000 dust detections, including information 
about dust grain direction of motion. The data range from 1995-01-01 
to 2016-01-01 and will be updated periodically.

PLANNING YOUR SOLAR SYSTEM OBSERVATIONS WITH JWST
 
At the 2016 DPS meeting in Pasadena, Drs. Stefanie Milam (GSFC) and  
John Stansberry (STScI) presented a "JWST Early Release Science (ERS) 
and Proposal Workshop" as well as a JWST Townhall event. A webcast of 
the workshop, as well as all of the presentations, are now available 
on line at: 

https://webcast.stsci.edu/webcast/detail.xhtml?talkid=5248&parent=1  

In addition to details about the specific ERS call, the packages 
include detailed description of JWST's moving target capability as well 
as expected instrumental performances. If you have any questions on any 
of the presented materials, the ERS program, or JWST observations, 
please feel free to contact Stefanie Milam (Stefanie.n.milam@nasa.gov).

SMALL BODIES ASSESSMENT GROUP EARLY-CAREER TRAVEL SUPPORT

We are planning to offer limited U.S. travel support for early career 
scientists to participate in the SBAG 16 meeting, to be held at the 
University of Arizona on January 11-13, 2017. Interested undergraduate 
students, graduate students, postdocs, and other early career 
scientists (within 3 years of PhD/MS/BS) should submit a letter 
and a CV to SBAG Early Career Secretary Angela Stickle 
(angela.stickle@jhuapl.edu) by COB (5 pm Eastern time) November 25, 
2016. Included in the letter, which must not exceed 2 pages, should be 
a demonstration of financial need and an explanation of how the 
applicant's work relates to the purposes of the SBAG. The letter and 
CV should be combined into a single PDF document for submission by 
e-mail attachment. Recipients of travel support will be expected to 
give a short presentation of their SBAG-relevant work at the SBAG 16 
meeting.
