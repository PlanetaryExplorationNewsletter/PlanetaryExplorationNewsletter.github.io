PLANETARY SESSIONS AT GSA CORDILLERAN SECTION MAY 2017: T16 & T17

The GSA Cordilleran Section Meeting will be held in Honolulu, HI, 
23-25 May 2017. There will be a number of sessions of relevance to 
planetary scientists.

We welcome submissions to the following sessions:

T16. New Developments in the Geology and Geochemistry of Mars 
(Bell, Rowland)
Conveners: Jim Bell and Scott Rowland
This session will highlight spectacular recent advances in our 
understanding of the geology and geochemistry of Mars. Orbiters, 
landers, and rovers are almost daily providing new views, and new 
data, that paint a picture of Mars as a world with a complex volcanic, 
impact, tectonic, and fluvial history.

T17. Volcanism Across the Solar System
Conveners: Sarah Fagents and Rosaly Lopes
This session will focus on extraterrestrial volcanism, from our 
neighboring silicate planets to the ice-rich bodies of the outer solar 
system. We encourage contributions discussing new data and observations, 
recent modeling developments, novel techniques, field analog studies, 
integration of diverse data sets, and comparative planetary studies.

Abstract deadline is 14 February 2017.  

In addition to the conference sessions, there is a slate of workshops 
and short courses, as well as fieldtrips on Oahu, Maui, Kauai, and 
Hawaii.

23-25 May 2017. There will be a number of sessions of relevance to 
planetary scientists.

We welcome submissions to the following sessions:

T18. Deposition and Diagenesis of Volcaniclastic Sediments on Earth 
and Mars 
Conveners: Juergen Schieber, Ken Edgett, David Bish
Our goal is to bring together researchers investigating deposition 
and post-depositional alteration of terrestrial volcaniclastic 
sediments with those working on Martian sediments and sedimentary 
rock. To help with the science return from Mars rover data, of 
particular interest are mafic to intermediate sediments, sedimentary 
rocks, and their diagenesis.

T19. Mars On Earth: Understanding Mars Through Earth Surface Processes 
Conveners: Robert A. Craddock, Jacob E. Bleacher, Christopher Hamilton
Analog sites on Earth are useful for understanding geologic features 
on Mars, testing technology for future manned and unmanned missions, 
and for evaluating potential past and present conditions for 
astrobiology. Results from ongoing analog field studies, particularly 
those in Hawaii, will be presented.

Abstract deadline is 14 February 2017.

THE SETI INSTITUTE CALLS FOR WHITE PAPERS FOR THE ADVANCEMENT OF 
SETI RESEARCH

The SETI Institute is soliciting the US and international scientific 
community for inputs to advance the search for intelligent life in 
the Universe, and for the creation of a multidisciplinary Virtual 
Institute for SETI Research.

The principles associated with our new vision of SETI research 
have been outlined in an article published in the August, 2016 
edition of Astrobiology:

http://online.liebertpub.com/doi/full/10.1089/ast.2016.1536

Building upon this paper, the SETI Institute is now soliciting 
community input for the development of a roadmap and a research 
program based on a long-term vision for SETI activities. Ultimately, 
the goal is the creation of a Virtual Institute for SETI Research. 
Its mandate will be to understand how intelligent life interacts 
with its environment and communicates. 

The goals and objectives of this call, and its significance, are 
detailed in the a separate document, available at: 

http://www.seti.org/seti-institute/call-for-white-papers-search-
for-intelligent-life-and-creation-of-virtual-institute

This is an opportunity to contribute to shaping a new and exciting 
chapter in the history of SETI. We encourage you to respond to this 
call, and to distribute it to interested colleagues.

POSTDOCTORAL POSITION AT SWEDISH INSTITUTE OF SPACE PHYSICS

Applications are invited for a post-doctoral position at the Swedish 
Institute of Space Physics in Uppsala for research related to 
scientific studies of solar wind-magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling. 
Of particular interest are energy and plasma exchange between the 
two major regimes of plasma in the near-Earth environment, and the 
related flow of electric currents in the high-latitude auroral zone.

Our research group is funded to carry out research utilizing the new 
ESA multi-satellite mission SWARM in low Earth orbit in conjunction 
with other multi-satellite missions (Cluster, Themis and MMS) in 
magnetospheric orbits, and a variety of ground-based instrumentation 
(radars, magnetometers and all-sky cameras).

Candidates should have completed a PhD no earlier than 
15 December 2013. If the candidate has an older degree and wants to 
refer to special circumstances, such as parental leave, this should 
be clearly stated. The candidate should not currently be an active 
researcher at IRF in Uppsala or at the Department of Physics and 
Astronomy at Uppsala University.

TENURED SCIENTIST POSITION AT SWEDISH INSTITUTE OF SPACE PHYSICS

Applications are invited for a tenured position at the Swedish 
Institute of Space Physics in Uppsala for studies of the magnetosphere 
of the Earth, and its interaction with the upper atmosphere, in 
response to extreme solar wind driving conditions such as violent 
coronal mass ejections. Of particular interest are energy and plasma 
exchange between the two major regimes of plasma in the near-Earth 
environment, and the related flow of very intense electric currents 
in the auroral and sub-auroral zone under extreme storm-time 
conditions. We aim to better understand the mechanisms leading to 
strong geomagnetically-induced currents  affecting man-made equipment 
on the ground.

Our research group carries out research to better understand extreme 
space weather events  and allow improved prognoses of such events 
and their potential impacts. We conduct scientific studies utilising 
all sources of available solar wind and magnetospheric data, such as 
the missions at L1, multi-satellite missions in magnetospheric 
orbits, other spacecraft in lower orbits and a variety of ground-
based instrumentation.

4*P COMA MORPHOLOGY CAMPAIGN

As you may know three comets (41P/Tuttle-Giacobini-Kresak, 
45P/Honda-Mrkos-Pajdusakova in early 2017, and 46P/Wirtanen
in late 2018) will have close approaches (0.08-0.15 AU) to Earth 
in the next two years - a relatively rare occurrence.

Similar to the Comet ISON Coma Morphology Campaign, we are
organizing this 4*P Coma Morphology Campaign and are requesting
the participation of both professional and amateur astronomers.
The goal is to achieve science facilitated by a multi-longitudinal
observing campaign. 

Please look at:

information related to the campaign.

Thank You.
Sincerely,
Nalin Samarasinha, Beatrice Mueller, Matthew Knight, Tony Farnham,
