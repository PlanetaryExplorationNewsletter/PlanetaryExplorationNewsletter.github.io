2016 PIERAZZO INTERNATIONAL STUDENT TRAVEL AWARD

Application deadline: 9 PM PST, November 30, 2016

Awards will be announced on or before December 9, 2016

This award is established by the Planetary Science Institute in memory 
of Senior Scientist Betty Pierazzo to support and encourage graduate 
students to build international collaborations and relationships in 
planetary science. Two awards will be made each year, contingent upon 
there being meritorious applications. One will be awarded to a graduate 
student working on his or her Ph.D. at an institution within the U.S. 
This is to support travel to a planetary science related meeting 
(conferences and workshops) outside of the U.S. The second award will 
be to a graduate student working on his or her Ph.D. at an institution 
outside of the U.S. This is to support travel to a planetary science 
related meeting within the U.S. These include general meetings that 
have planetary-focused sessions such as the AGU, GSA, EGU and IAG.

The award will consist of a certificate and up to $2000US.

PETITION FOR SCIENCE PROGRAMMING ON MAJOR NETWORKS

Dear Planetary Colleagues, 

We have created a change.org petition to make the ABC, NBC, CBS, and 
FOX networks aware of the need for routine, high-quality science 
programming from 6 pm to midnight. If this problem is addressed, we 
believe it will advance our national discussion with respect to 
political issues that require basic scientific understanding, as well 
as enrich our society and make our work more accessible. 

We hope that you will sign our petition and share it so that we can 
address the severe lack of public scientific engagement in the United 
States. 

Here is a link to the petition with more description:

Thank you for your support! Ad Astra!

POST-DOCTORAL POSITION IN MIDAS CALIBRATION AND ARCHIVING AT THE 
SPACE RESEARCH INSTITUTE IN GRAZ, AUSTRIA

The Space Research institute in Graz, Austria, is looking (rather 
urgently) for candidates for an ESA-funded postdoc position to carry 
out extended calibration and archiving activities for MIDAS, the Atomic 
Force Microscope on Rosetta. The post is funded for two years and 
should start on 01/01/17! In principle the post could be filled by 
someone with a background in cometary science (with strong computing 
skills), AFM or image analysis. For more details see:

CALL FOR ABSTRACTS FOR POLARIMETRY SESSION PS1.4 AT EGU 2017

Dear colleagues and polarimetry enthusiasts,

We are happy to announce that the polarimetry session is back in the 
EGU 2017 General Assembly programme. You are kindly invited to submit 
an abstract in this session, which is co-organised with the AS 
(Atmospheric Sciences) and ST (Solar-Terrestrial sciences) divisions. 
Therefore, contributions ranging from Earth sciences to exoplanetary 
science are all welcome.

Contributions from Early Career Scientists are greatly encouraged. 
Please do not hesitate to share this announcement with your networks 
and/or through social media. Abstract deadline is January 11th, 2017.

PS1.4/AS4.45/ST1.11
Polarimetry as an invaluable tool to study the Solar System and 
beyond (co-organized)
Convener: Loic Rossi
Co-Conveners: Mathieu Barthelemy, Herve Lamy, Anny-Chantal

ICE IN THE SOLAR SYSTEM WORKSHOP ABSTRACT DEADLINE EXTENDED

The abstract submission deadline for the Ice in the Solar System 
Workshop has been extended to Wednesday, November 23rd, 23:59 CET, to
accommodate the exceptional interest of the community for this event.

http://www.cosmos.esa.int/web/ices-in-the-solar-system

This workshop will focus on experimental and mission data relevant for 
the past and future exploration of volatile rich bodies in the Solar 
System.The pre-registration has shown a strong interest in this topic 
with over one hundred participants expected. The topics covered by this 
workshop will include: Experimental research and associated modeling 
(preparation of ice analogs and experimental weathering in the lab, 
analysis and modeling techniques to infer optical, thermal, mechanical, 
electrical, thermodynamical, structural and compositional properties.
Mission data revealing ices and their properties, composition, 
geological context and history in the Outer Solar System (Rings, icy 
moons, KBOs and Kuiper Belt), Asteroid Belt, Mars (polar caps, ground 
ice) or well within the snow line (Mercury, Moon). The astrobiological 
potential of ices and their role and transport during the Solar System 
evolution- including the connection to the interstellar medium, 
proto-solar nebulae, icy giants and planetesimals formation.

PLANETARY GEOMORPHOLOGY AT EGU 2017 - FINANCIAL SUPPORT DEADLINE 1ST 
DECEMBER 2016

The deadline is fast approaching for financial support at EGU 2017 
(Vienna Austria 23-28 April) including for the Planetary Geomorphology 
session GM1.4/PS9.5. Support is available for students, early career 
and established scientists and your abstract must be submitted to be 
eligible. The Planetary Geomorphology session welcomes abstracts 
concerning landforms and the processes that shape them on all solar 
system bodies. Earth analogue studies, flume/simulation work and 
novel approaches using remote sensing data are especially encouraged. 
This session has always provided a stimulating forum for cross-
disciplinary discussion and we hope you'll join us once again to 
bring geomorphology and planetary science closer together. This year 
we welcome Prof. Michael Lamb from Caltech as our invited speaker!
