BIOSIGNATURES OF EXTANT LIFE ON OCEAN WORLDS WORKSHOP

September 12-14, 2016
Goddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt, MD
http://ssed.gsfc.nasa.gov/BELOW/

The goal of this workshop is to evolve our understanding of the 
detectability of extant life on ocean worlds, such as Europa and 
Enceladus. The event will bring astrobiologists, biologists, chemists, 
geologists, oceanographers and mission and instrument developers 
together to discuss the informational value of different types of 
biosignatures, the importance of context and the concept of ecology 
in the search for extant life, and examples of measurement sets and 
exploration criteria that would support a productive search for 
extant biology in future missions.

AGU 2016 SESSION: PLANETARY ANALOGS

We invite contributions to a session focused on the planetary analogs 
ranging from the tops of volcanoes to the bottom of oceans, at the 
2016 AGU Fall Meeting in San Francisco, CA, December 12-16.

For more information, visit:

https://agu.confex.com/agu/fm16/preliminaryview.cgi/Session14064

On land and in the oceans, a variety of environments exist that provide 
relevant analogs for planetary targets. These include: 

(1) deep oceanic water-rock interactions as analogs to Europa, 
    Enceladus, and early Mars processes; 
(2) volcanic terrains that extend our understanding of the habitability 
    of Mars; 
(3) terrestrial impact craters that enable first-hand study of a 
    geological process that ubiquitously affects solid bodies 
    throughout the Solar System; 
(4) active subaqueous oceanic and fluvial sediment transport that 
    extends our understanding of dune and ripple morphologies as 
    analogs for the thicker atmospheres of Venus and Titan. 

Science-driven exploration of these and other analogs result in new 
data, and leads to the development of new and novel operational and 
technological capabilities that serve to enable and inform the next 
generation of human-robotic planetary exploration. This session will 
focus on sharing new results from across diverse yet complementary 
analog research programs fostering interdisciplinary cooperation.

Submission deadline: August 3, 2016.

Conveners: Darlene Sze Shien Lim, Lynn D Neakrase, Timothy N Titus, 
and Christopher R German.

AGU 2016 SESSION: DATA VISUALIZATION IN EARTH AND PLANETARY SCIENCES

We would like to invite the community to consider submitting abstracts 
to our AGU 2016 Fall Meeting session, which focuses on novel data 
visualization techniques. Specifically, we would like to bring together 
a diverse range of geoscientists to discuss the many different 
platforms and technologies being used and developed for data 
visualization.

Session title: Sympathy for the Data: Novel approaches to the art of 
data visualization. For more information, go to:

https://agu.confex.com/agu/fm16/preliminaryview.cgi/Session13499

Please consider contributing to what we hope is a beneficial 
discussion of the best data visualization techniques that we, as 
scientists, can continue to build on in the future to better 
communicate our research. Any questions can be addressed to Martin 
(martin@seismo.wustl.edu). We are very interested in receiving 
abstracts from a wide range of researchers to develop networks across 
disciplines.

Conveners:
Martin Pratt (Washington University in St. Louis)

University)

AGU 2016 SESSION P005: CRACKING UP - ICE-OCEAN DYNAMICS ON EARTH AND 
OCEAN WORLDS

We invite abstracts for our AGU 2016 session, which aims to host a 
fruitful discussion of ice-ocean dynamics on Earth and around the solar 
system. We seek a wide range of terrestrial glaciology/oceanography and 
planetary research to foster the Earth-planetary connection.

Ice-fluid interactions are major contributors to the dynamic and often 
unpredictable processes observed across many "ocean worlds," including 
on Earth and the floating shells of distant icy satellites. However, 
our understanding of the physical processes controlling ice-ocean 
interaction remains limited, even on Earth. Bringing together Earth 
and planetary studies of ice-fluid interaction is the aim of this 
session, which invites abstracts focused on dynamic phenomena that 
arise in ices due to ice-fluid interactions. This session is open to 
contributions regarding sea ice, glaciers and ice shelves, icy 
satellites, Pluto, and beyond. Examples of these dynamics range from 
sea ice drift and ice shelf collapse, to plumes on Enceladus, to chaos 
on Europa.

As a reminder, the AGU 2016 submission deadline is 3 August.

AGU 2016 SESSION P008: EVOLUTIONS, INTERACTIONS AND ORIGINS OF OUTER
PLANET SATELLITES

Conveners: Amanda R Hendrix and Krishan K. Khurana 

This session explores current and past planetary processes that lead 
to unique present day conditions on outer planet satellites. The 
session will consist of invited and contributed talks that highlight 
geological and geophysical modeling and interpretation of both 
remote-sensed and in-situ data. Presentations on interaction of 
planetary field and plasma with the surfaces and interiors of the 
moons and theoretical models of the origin and evolution of surfaces 
and interiors of the moons are also welcome. Contributions that 
investigate processes on multiple moons to uncover underlying trends 
are especially welcome.

AGU abstracts are due no later than 3 August.

AGU 2016 SESSION P030: THE EARLY MARS ENVIRONMENT: WARM AND WET, COLD 
AND WET, OR COLD AND ICY?
 
We invite contributions to a session focused on the environment of 
early Mars, at the 2016 AGU Fall Meeting in San Francisco, CA, December 
12-16.

Geological, geochemical and mineralogical evidence indicative of 
flowing and ponding liquid water on the surface of ancient Mars 
appears abundantly across most of the Martian landscape. However, the 
presence of liquid water on the surface of early Mars is difficult to 
reconcile with the reduced solar luminosity at 3.8 Ga. and before, 
unless greenhouse warming is considered. But the scarcity of carbonate 
rocks on the martian surface and the absence of evidence for vigorous 
recycling of volatiles cause many researchers to regard warming 
mechanisms as speculative. This leaves still open the question of how 
the observed fluvial features could have formed. We invite 
contributions from climate modeling, geomorphology, geochemistry and 
mineralogy that address the question of whether early Mars climate was 
"warm and wet", "cold and wet" or "cold and icy". This session will 
focus on both sharing new results from different perspectives and 
fostering communication among the community.

SILICON VALLEY ASTRONOMY LECTURE SERIES PASSES ONE MILLION VIEWS ON 
YOUTUBE

The Silicon Valley Astronomy Lectures at Foothill College, in Los 
Altos, California, just passed the milestone of one million views on 
its YouTube channel at: 

http://www.youtube.com/svastronomylectures

The series of popular lectures, explaining the latest discoveries and 
ideas in astronomy in everyday language, features noted astronomers 
from around California and the country. Recent speakers have included 
Carolyn Porco, imaging team leader for the Cassini mission to Saturn; 
Robert Kirshner of Harvard and Alex Filippenko of Berkeley, both 
members of the teams that discovered, to everyone's surprise, that 
the expansion of the universe is accelerating; astronaut Ed Lu 
speaking about discovering asteroids that threaten the Earth; and 
NASA's Jeff Moore, from the New Horizons science team, explaining 
what we have discovered about Pluto.

The series will be starting its 17th year in October 2016. The 
lectures are jointly sponsored by NASA's Ames Research Center, the 
SETI Institute, the Astronomical Society of the Pacific, and the 
Foothill College Astronomy Department. All four organizations work 
together in selecting speakers, doing publicity, and donating the 
labor and expense of running the lectures. 

The lectures are also available as audio podcasts at:
