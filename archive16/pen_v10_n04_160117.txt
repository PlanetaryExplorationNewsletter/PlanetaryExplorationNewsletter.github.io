CALL FOR ABSTRACTS - SECOND INTERNATIONAL WORKSHOP ON MARTIAN GULLIES
 
The ”Martian Gullies and Their Earth Analogues" workshop is 20-21 June 
2016, hosted by the Geological Society, Burlington House, London, UK.

#martiangullies

The deadline for oral abstracts: Friday, 29 January 2016.

We encourage both established Mars researchers and those new to the 
field to attend and contribute. We particularly welcome abstracts 
concerning Earth analogues - experimental, numerical modelling and, 
of course, remote sensing studies will all be considered. The workshop 
is focused on gullies but can encompass contributions on associated 
landforms, such as recurring slope lineae (RSL), glacier-like forms, 
"solifluction" lobes, patterned ground, impact craters, dunes, etc., 
with the caveat that they impact on our understanding of gully 
formation or modification. For more details on the conference, please 
see the website:

https://www.geolsoc.org.uk/martiangullies

Please note that student members of the IAS will shortly be able to 
apply for a travel grant to attend this workshop through the IAS

JPGU MEETING 2016 SESSION: OUTER SOLAR SYSTEM EXPLORATION TODAY AND 
TOMORROW

[P-PS01] Outer Solar System Exploration Today and Tomorrow (session 
on May 22) will be held at the JPGU Meeting 2016 to be held in Chiba, 
Japan, May 22-26, 2016.

The giant planets provide many keys to understanding planetary 
processes. They play an important role in shaping our solar system,
and the physical and chemical processes they harbor also provide
a unique opportunity to study the phenomena relevant for studying
Earth and other planets, including exoplanetary systems. In this 
session, we discuss a wide range of topics encompassing the giant 
planets and their moons, including their origins, interiors, 
atmospheres, compositions, surface features, and electromagnetic 
fields. To advocate for current and future outer planets exploration 
(Cassini, Juno, New Horizons, JUICE, and beyond), we also call for 
discussions on future missions to explore giant planet systems, 
including how to develop better international cooperation. 
Discussion in this latter category will include progress in developing 
a solar sail mission concept for observing the Jupiter system and its 
trojan asteroids. We would very much appreciate your attendance and 
like to invite the submission of abstracts.
