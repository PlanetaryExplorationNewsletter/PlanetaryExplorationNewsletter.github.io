EGU 2016 SESSION PS5.1/ST2.2: CALL FOR ABSTRACTS

We invite you to submit an abstract to the following session of the 
next EGU meeting (Vienna, Austria, 17-22 April 2016).

PS5.1/ST2.2: Planetary Plasma Physics and Interactions in the Solar 
System

The emphasis of the session is on all aspects of planetary plasma 
physics and interactions in the Solar System, including:
(a) magnetospheres, ionospheres, auroras
(b) the solar wind interaction with planets, moons, asteroids and 
    comets
(c) plasma interactions with exospheres, dust and surfaces 
    (e.g., at Mercury, Europa, Ganymede, our Moon, etc.)
(d) intercomparisons of planetary environments

Contributions are welcome that address previous (e.g., CHANDRAYAAN-1, 
KAGUYA, VENUS EXPRESS, MESSENGER), present (e.g., CASSINI, MARS 
EXPRESS, MAVEN, ROSETTA, CHANG'E 2), forthcoming (e.g., JUNO, BEPI 
COLOMBO) and planned (e.g., JUICE) observations from space. Analyses 
of ground-based observations as well as theoretical modelling and 
simulations are also welcome. Laboratory studies on planetary 
analogues aiming to simulate the surface-plasma interaction are 
considered as well.

The participants will be later invited to submit an article in a 
forthcoming dedicated special issue in Planetary and Space Science.

Abstract submission deadline: 13 January 2016.

BIOSIGNATURE PRESERVATION AND DETECTION IN MARS ANALOG ENVIRONMENTS
 
This conference will be held the week of May 16, 2016 in Reno, Nevada.
 
Our objective is to focus strategies to detect possible biosignatures 
on Mars in different categories of geologic settings by assessing the 
attributes and preservation potential of various biosignatures in 
different Mars-analog habitable environments on Earth. The ability 
to capture and retain information about ancient life in the form of 
fossil biosignatures in the geological record depends upon complex 
interactions between key biogeochemical variables, including those 
factors that control rates of organic matter degradation and rates 
of mineralization, mediated by the specific physical and chemical 
properties of the buried organic matter. In addition, post-
depositional processes may dramatically affect the stability of 
geological materials and the biosignatures they contain, thereby 
challenging life-based interpretations. Participants in this 
conference will review the diverse categories of biosignatures that 
occur in an array of Mars-analog environments. Our plan is to produce 
a conference report that will inform the evaluation of potential Mars 
landing sites regarding their potential to preserve and provide 
accessible evidence of past martian life.

31ST MEPAG MEETING - 1ST INFORMATION CIRCULAR

I cordially invite you to attend the 2016 face-to-face meeting of 
the Mars Exploration Program Analysis Group (MEPAG), scheduled for 
1.5 days, March 2-3, 2016, in Silver Spring, MD. 

This meeting will report on the implications of the developments 
in Mars exploration since the 2015 MEPAG meeting as well as the 
overall status of Mars exploration. We will also handle some 
organizational matters for MEPAG (e.g.,, Chair and Executive 
Committee succession). 

Key discussion topics will include:

* Overview of latest science results (Curiosity, MAVEN, etc.)
* Status of Mars exploration by NASA and other space agencies
* Interaction with the Human program (HEOMD)
   - Status of Humans to Mars (the Evolvable Mars Campaign) within NASA
   - First Landing Site/Exploration Zone Workshop for Humans Missions 
     to the Surface of Mars
* HSO-SAG, NEX-SAG and ICE-WG reports
* NASA and ESA landing site selection activities
* Preview of upcoming missions (ExoMars-TGO, InSIGHT)

The meeting is open to all members of the Mars science community, 
and I welcome our international colleagues. We will also broadcast 
the meeting via Adobe Connect for those who cannot attend in person.

I look forward to seeing you in Washington!

Professor. Lisa Pratt
MEPAG Chair

FROM STAR AND PLANET FORMATION TO EARLY LIFE

25-28 April 2016
Vilnius, Lithuania
 
The meeting will cover a multitude of scientific subjects ranging 
from star and planet formation until the early evolution of life on 
Earth. It aims to bring together astronomers, physicists, chemists, 
geologists and biologists as well as academics and students from 
humanities to discuss the most important questions and newest 
findings in all related disciplines. Special sessions will be devoted 
to comets, meteorites, prebiotic chemistry and early life.

The Conference will take place from 25 to 28 April 2016 at the Art 
Nouveau style Hotel Artis Centrum in the historical city centre of 
Vilnius (UNESCO World Heritage Site).
 
On the website of the conference: 
 
http://www.vilnius2016.eu
 
you will find information about the event and Vilnius in general.  
The meeting is fairly inexpensive and cheap accommodation in hotels 
and hostels is available.
 
Registration and abstract submission is 29 February 2016.

de Heroismo (UNESCO World Cultural Heritage) will include:

* Lectures by leading scientists in the field covering a cornucopia 
  of different subjects
* Field excursions to geologically interesting sights (volcanic areas,

multitude of different fields. Field studies on the colonisation of 
lava fields and Mars analogue landscapes will complement the lectures. 
The programme of the summer school comprises:

* Lectures by internationally leading scientists covering a broad 
  range of subjects on biosignatures with the focus on detection of 
  life on Mars
