HIRISE SPACECRAFT OPERATIONS ENGINEER POSITIONS

HiRISE (uahirise.org) is hiring two Spacecraft Operations Engineers 
to work at the HiRISE Operations Center on the University of Arizona's 
Tucson campus. This is a full-time position working with HiRISE team 
scientists and JPL and other MRO instrument operations staff to plan 
and command high resolution images of Mars.

[NASA] FINAL TEXT RELEASED FOR INTERDISCIPLINARY SCIENCE FOR 
ECLIPSE 2017

On August 21, 2017, a total solar eclipse will traverse the continental 
U.S. from Oregon to South Carolina. It is estimated that hundreds of 
millions of viewers in North America will witness this natural event 
(http://eclipse2017.nasa.gov/). The purpose of this program element is 
to support development of new research or enhancement of existing 
research, applied to the 2017 eclipse. NASA is seeking proposals that 
would utilize the unique opportunity presented by the solar eclipse to 
study the Sun, Earth, Moon, astronomy, and/or space science, including 
the ionosphere-thermosphere-mesosphere (ITM) system. Building on 
existing partnerships and the use of interdisciplinary or citizen 
science approaches is encouraged. All proposals must demonstrate links 
to the 2017 solar eclipse.

Step-1 proposals are due October 27, 2016. 
Step-2 proposals are due November 30, 2016.

A NATIONAL SCIENCE TEACHERS ASSOCIATION VIRTUAL CONFERENCE: THE AUGUST 
2017 "ALL-AMERICAN" ECLIPSE OF THE SUN

(A Guide for How to Help Audiences, Students, and Community Understand 
and View it Safely)

with

Dennis Schatz (Pacific Science Center) and Andrew Fraknoi (Foothill 
College)

Featuring: Claire Raftery (National Solar Observatory)

Saturday, October 15, 2016
10 AM - 2 PM ET

In this virtual conference, designed for school teachers, museum 
educators, park rangers, librarians, and anyone who is working with 
them in anticipation of the eclipse, two experienced astronomers and 
educators, will:

- introduce the general topic of eclipses and what they can teach us;
- explain where, when, and how to view the 2017 eclipse safely;
- lead a series of hands-on activities for classrooms and informal 
  science settings (a free book of activities is included in 
  registration)
- discuss how teachers and informal educators can become a locus of 
  eclipse outreach in their communities, including how to get a kit of 
  safe-viewing glasses (with examples from what teachers are already 
  planning);
- host an introductory discussion of the latest solar science with 
  Claire Raftery from the National Solar Observatory.

CALL FOR SUPPORT: CASTAWAY, COMET AND ASTEROID SPACE TELESCOPE

Proposed as a candidate in the 2016 ESA call for (M)edium class mission 
proposals, the Comet and Asteroid Space Telescope (CASTAWAY) will 
conduct a detailed spectroscopic survey of the thousands of objects 
found in the Main Asteroid Belt. This will be achieved with a small, 
0.5 m space-based telescope periodically passing within the MAB, while 
performing visual and near infrared spectroscopy and thermal infrared 
imaging (from a range of 0.1-0.5 AU), and perform basic opportunistic 
fly-by events of pre-selected targets. This will provide, for the first 
time, detailed information on the connection between asteroid 
composition, geomorphology and orbital evolution. Smaller (1-100 m) and 
fainter, passing targets will also be discovered with dedicated star 
tracker-like cameras.

The members of the CASTAWAY international team of proposers would 
welcome indications of support for the mission. We ask everyone who 
wishes to express their support to please visit the following webpage: 

http://bit.ly/castawaymission

The list of supporters will be appended to the CASTAWAY proposal before 
its submission to ESA by 5th October. More information on the mission 
can be found at the same website. Please feel free to forward this 
message to your colleagues.
