[NASA] ASTRO-H GUEST OBSERVER - CYCLE 1 CANCELLATION

NASA planned to issue a call for Guest Observer proposals for the 
ASTRO-H mission but due to an anomaly experienced by the Hitomi 
spacecraft on March 26, 2016, and the subsequent loss of the mission, 
the planned release of this program element has been canceled.

[NASA] CONCEPTS FOR OCEAN WORLDS LIFE DETECTION TECHNOLOGY (COLDTECH)
 
The Concepts for Ocean worlds Life Detection Technology (COLDTech) 
Program supports the development of spacecraft-based instruments and 
technology for surface and subsurface exploration of ocean worlds such 
as Europa, Enceladus, and Titan.

Specifically, COLDTech seeks to a) develop and advance the maturity 
of science instruments, especially those focused on the detection of 
evidence of life, especially extant life, in the ocean worlds of the
outer Solar System (e.g., Enceladus, Europa, and Titan); b) sample 
acquisition, delivery and analysis systems for such missions, and 
c) spacecraft technologies required to access the oceans. 
 
Mandatory Step-1 proposals are due by June 17, 2016, and Step-2
proposals are due by August 12, 2016.

28TH EDITION OF THE IAC WINTER SCHOOL: SOLAR SYSTEM EXPLORATION

This year the XXVIII Edition of the Winter School of Astrophysics, 
organized by the Instituto de Astrofisica de Canarias, is focused 
on the exploration of the Solar System. The school will be held in 
the UNESCO word heritage city of San Cristobal de La Laguna, in 
Tenerife (Canary Islands, Spain) in November, 7-16, 2016.

The school in intended for post-graduate students in Astrophysics 
completing their PhD, and also to young postdocs. It is limited to 
50 participants, and will provide several advanced courses in specific 
topics like planetary space missions, asteroids, comets, origin and 
evolution of the Solar System and a small workshop on planetary data 
archiving and image processing.

MAVEN SCIENCE TEAM MEETING

The next MAVEN science-team meeting will be held on the Boston 
University campus on 14-17 June.  The meeting is open to non-team 
members as long as (i) they are actively working with MAVEN data, 
and (ii) they receive advance approval. To request approval or for 
more information, contact the MAVEN P.I., Bruce Jakosky, at 
bruce.jakosky@lasp.colorado.edu. No on-site walk-ups will be allowed.

88TH GSI CONGRESS ABSTRACT DEADLINE POSTPONED

The deadline for the submission of planetary, geological, and 
volcanological abstracts to the 88 GSI Congress, which will take place 
in Naples on 7-9 September 2016, is postponed to 30 May 2016.

The deadline for the registration to the excursions, including Vesuvius 
and Campi Flegrei, is 15 June 2016.

CALL FOR PARTICIPATION - SOCET SET TRAINING OPPORTUNITY

The Planetary Photogrammetry Guest Facility at the Astrogeology Science 
Center of the U.S. Geological Survey would like to announce its Call 
for Participation for a training opportunity on July 25-27, 2016. This 
training will cover photogrammetric processing of planetary stereo 
imagery using USGS Integrated Software for Imagers and Spectrometers 
and SOCET SET software developed by BAE Systems. The training is FREE 
to participants, and will cover end-to-end, hands-on photogrammetric 
procedures for surface extraction (i.e., digital elevation model 
generation) from Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter HiRISE image pairs.  For 
additional information and application instructions, please see 

http://astrogeology.usgs.gov/facilities/photogrammetry-guest-facility.  

For information about a USGS Integrated Software for Imagers and 
Spectrometers Hands-on Workshop being held July 28-29, 2016 - also 
hosted by the Astrogeology Science Center, please see: 

https://isis.astrogeology.usgs.gov/fixit/projects/isis/news

Interested individuals can attended both the SOCET SET and the USGS 
Integrated Software for Imagers and Spectrometers workshops.
