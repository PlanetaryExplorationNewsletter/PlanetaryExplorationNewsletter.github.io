The instruments:
  Alpha Particle X-ray Spectrometer (APXS)
  Chemistry & Micro-Imaging (ChemCam)
  Chemistry and Mineralogy (CheMin)
  Dynamic Albedo of Neutrons (DAN)
  Hazard Avoidance Cameras (Hazcam)
  Mars Hand Lens Imager (MAHLI)
  Mars Descent Imager (MARDI)
  Mast-mounted Cameras (Mastcam)
  Navigation Cameras (Navcam)
  Position Localization and Attitude Correction Estimate Storage 
    (PLACES)
  Radiation Assessment Detector (RAD)

  Sample Analysis at Mars (SAM)
  Spacecraft, Planet, Instrument, Pointing C-Matrix, and Event 
     kernels (SPICE)

This release's data:

https://pds.nasa.gov/tools/subscription_service/SS-20160801.shtml

Links to MSL data sets may be found on the PDS Geosciences Node web
site: 

http://pds-geosciences.wustl.edu/missions/msl/ 

or reached from the main PDS home page: 

http://pds.nasa.gov/. 

MSL data are archived at the PDS Atmospheres, PPI, Geosciences, 
Imaging, and NAIF Nodes.

Two services for searching the MSL archives:
The Planetary Image Atlas at the Imaging Node allows selection of MSL
image data by specific search criteria.

http://pds-imaging.jpl.nasa.gov/search/

The MSL Analyst's Notebook at the Geosciences Node allows searching 
and downloading of all MSL data in the context of mission events.

[NASA] ROSES-16 AMENDMENT 20: LDAP PROPOSAL DUE DATES DELAYED

ROSES-16 Amendment 20: Proposal due dates delayed for C.8 the Lunar 
Data Analysis Program.

The Lunar Data Analysis Program (LDAP) program funds research on the 
analysis of recent lunar missions in order to enhance their scientific 
return. LDAP broadens scientific participation in the analysis of 
mission data sets and funds high-priority areas of research that 
support planning for future lunar missions.

Step-1 proposals are now due September 8, 2016, and Step-2 proposals 
are now due by November 10, 2016.

Go to  the NASA research opportunity homepage at: 

http://nspires.nasaprs.com/
