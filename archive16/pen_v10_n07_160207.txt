FREE BOOKLET ABOUT THE 2017 ECLIPSE OF THE SUN
 
On August 21, 2017, there will be a beautiful total eclipse of the Sun 
visible from the U.S. The path of the total eclipse is only about 60 
miles wide and goes from a beach in Oregon to a beach in South 
Carolina, crossing the country diagonally. A partial eclipse will be 
visible to 500 million people in the other parts of the US and North 
America.
 
It is not too early to start thinking about how and where best to see 
this sky event. Eclipse enthusiasts are already busy reserving lodging 
and viewing space in the narrow region where the total phase can be 
seen.
 
The non-profit National Science Teachers Association (NSTA) is making 
available a popular-level introduction to help explain the eclipse and 
how to view it. The free 8-page booklet is available at: 

http://www.nsta.org/publications/press/extras/files/solarscience/
SolarScienceInsert.pdf
 
The eclipse information comes from a new book for educators in and out 
of the classroom, entitled Solar Science. It includes 45 hands-on 
learning experiences (and background information) about the Sun, the 
Moon, the sky, the calendar, the seasons, and eclipses. You can see 
the full table of contents and some sample activities at:

[NASA] REQUEST FOR INFORMATION - USE OF THE PLANETARY SCIENCE DIVISION 
FACILITIES

The Planetary Science Division (PSD) is interested in maximizing the 
scientific productivity of its Facilities Program. To assess its 
Facilities Program, PSD initiated a review of its existing funded 
facilities, organized a special session at the upcoming Lunar and 
Planetary Science Conference (LPSC) in Houston, Texas, and is now 
soliciting comments from the planetary science community through this 
RFI.

In its review of existing facilities, PSD was focused on assessing how 
the currently funded facilities are working, how they serve the 
science needs of the broader planetary community, identifying the 
impact and productivity of each funded facility, and determine best 
practices and lessons learned for further development of a Facilities 
Program.

More information may be found at:

http://science.nasa.gov/researchers/sara/grant-solicitations/nasa-

Responses to this RFI are due as a PDF submitted via email by April 30, 
2016 to Doris Daou atDoris.Daou@nasa.gov with subject line: RESPONSE to 
Facilities RFI.

MICROSYMPOSIUM 57 - POLAR VOLATILES ON THE MOON AND MERCURY: NATURE, 
EVOLUTION AND FUTURE EXPLORATION

The Woodlands Waterway Marriott, Montgomery Ballroom, The Woodlands, 
Texas

March 19-20, 2016
 
The Microsymposium 57 program is now online at:

http://www.planetary.brown.edu/html_pages/micro57.htm
 
The discovery of polar volatile materials on the Moon and Mercury has 
revolutionized our thinking about the origin, evolution and 
exploration of these significant scientific legacies and potential 
future resources. What is the nature and distribution of these 
materials? How did they form? What is their age, how are they 
maintained, what is their abundance and what records do they hold of 
the geological, geochemical and orbital history of the Moon and 
Mercury? What can they tell us about the degassing history of the Moon 
and Mercury and the flux of comets in the Solar System? What can we 
learn from the comparison of polar volatile materials on Mercury and 
the Moon?
 
In this Microsymposium, we will explore our current knowledge and seek 
to identify the key questions, goals and objectives to underpin and 
motivate future exploration. We will review current exploration plans, 
including the U.S. Resource Prospector and CubeSats, Russian Luna and 
ESA BepiColombo missions.
