EDITOR MELISSA LANE DEPARTING PEN

PSI Senior Scientist Melissa Lane has been volunteering her time as a 
Planetary Exploration Newsletter editor since September 6, 2009. That 
is more than six and a half years of weekends during which she has 
diligently edited and co-edited 380 issues of PEN, helping and 
communicating with submitters, and making a lot of judgment calls.
She has decided it is now time to roll off and focus on other 
activities. We will miss our regular interactions with her. It has been
fun! We would also like to welcome PSI Associate Research Scientist 
Karen Stockstill-Cahill to our editorial team.

COMMUNITY MEETING ANNOUNCEMENT FOR AN ASTEROID MAIN BELT EXPLORER
MISSION AS AN ESA M5 MISSION PROPOSAL

Oxford, UK
April 11, 2016

On behalf of Neil Bowles (Univ. Oxford, UK) and Colin Snodgrass (The 
Open University, UK).

In preparation for ESA's upcoming M5 mission call we would like to 
announce a community meeting on the 11th of April in Oxford, UK to 
discuss a novel mission concept to understand the evolution of our 
Solar System. CASTAway will be the first mission dedicated to the 
exploration of the main belt in all its diversity by carrying out a 
comprehensive census and spectroscopic survey of main belt populations 
with reconnaissance flybys of at least ten objects. The mission will 
place a small telescope into a heliocentric orbit in the asteroid belt, 
equipped with a spectrograph covering 0.6-5 microns and multi-spectral 
imaging capability for flybys.

For more information and to register for the meeting on the 11th of 
April please see:

BRAVE NEW WORLDS: UNDERSTANDING THE PLANETS OF OTHER STARS

May 29-June 03, 2016
Lake Como School of Advanced Studies

Only nine planets were known before 1995, the ones orbiting our 
favourite star, the Sun, which then included Pluto. Twenty years later, 
we have "lost" Pluto but we have gained two thousand planets in orbit 
around other stars. The most revolutionary aspect of this young field 
is the discovery that the Solar System does not appear to be the 
paradigm in our Galaxy, but rather one of the many possible 
configurations we are seeing out there. These include planets 
completing a revolution in less than one day, as well as planets 
orbiting two stars or moving on trajectories so eccentric as to 
resemble comets. Some of them are freezing cold, some are so hot that 
their surface is molten.  Finding out why are these new worlds as they 
are is one of the key challenges of modern astrophysics.

The school is directed to Ph.D. students and young researchers who are 
interested in widening their knowledge in the field  exoplanets, 
through an integrated approach covering observations, data analysis 
and interpretation.

[NASA] PDS - MARS RECONNAISSANCE ORBITER CRISM, MRTDR, AND TER DATA 
RELEASE

The PDS is pleased to announce the release of two new Mars 
Reconnaissance Orbiter CRISM data sets, the Targeted Empirical Record 
(TER) and Map-projected Targeted Reduced Data Record (MTRDR) product 
suites. TER products are image cubes derived from CRISM hyperspectral 
targeted observations, post-processed to standardize the illumination 
and observation geometry and remove atmospheric gas absorptions and 
instrument artifacts. MTRDR products are the same data map-projected 
using terrain models of the Martian surface. The first delivery of 
these data sets covers the data acquisition period 2006-11-10 through 
2007-11-01. Future deliveries are planned.

EIGHTH ANNUAL SUSAN NIEBUR WOMEN IN PLANETARY SCIENCE EVENT AT LPSC

Wednesday, 6:00 to 7:30 p.m., Waterway 5, Woodlands Waterway Marriott 
(LPSC Conference Venue, Houston, TX)

Everyone has implicit or unconscious biases shaped by societal 
expectations and past experiences. These biases can influence 
evaluation and judgment, in either a positive or negative way. Studies 
have shown that unconscious bias can negatively affect the careers of 
women and other minorities in STEM fields. In addition to raising 
awareness about best practices, this event is meant as a springboard for 
implementing positive change in our community. We welcome everyone's 
input on this important topic. RSVP (not required, but requested so we 
will have an idea about attendance numbers), and more information: 

http://bit.ly/WIPS_2016

Note: The formal event will be 6:00-7:30 and light refreshments will be 
provided thanks to generous support from the Division for Planetary 
Sciences (thank you!!!). We have the room until 8 for those who wish to 
continue small group discussions.

OBSERVATION CAMPAIGN OF KBO TARGETS FOR PROPOSED NEW HORIZONS EXTENDED 
MISSION

Having completed its successful flyby of the Pluto system, the New
Horizons spacecraft is on a trajectory to encounter Kuiper Belt Object
2014 MU69. Pending NASA approval for an extended mission, New Horizons 
will also take advantage of being an observing platform in the outer 
solar system to observe a select number of other KBOs having favorable 
geometries for resolved or high signal-to-noise measurements.

Earth-based observations can support these pending New Horizons 
measurements through calibrated photometry at low phase angle (Earth),
which will be complementary to the higher phase angle data from the
spacecraft. In particular for objects having the potential for resolved
imaging from the spacecraft, knowledge of the rotational phase at the 
time of the New Horizons observations can help constrain the overall 
shape of these distant objects. An Earth-based campaign website in 
support of the pending science from the New Horizons extended mission 
is under construction.

DATA MANAGEMENT PLAN WRITING WORKSHOP AT LPSC 2016

ROSES 2016, section 3.5 states that Data Management Plans (DMP) are 
required in proposals in order to broaden the access to NASA-funded 
research with some exceptions.

To aid researchers in developing (DMP), NASA will be hosting a 
workshop for writing DMPs at LPSC 2016.  NASA-HQ, Dr. Michael New, will 
present on the expectations of what should be in a DMP. NASA-PDS will 
present initial guidelines for calculating the level of effort required 
to archive common data types.

The workshop will be held during lunch on Monday, March 21st, from 
12:00 until 1:15pm.

Room: Grogan's Mill

JMARS AT LPSC

Explore Mars, Moons, Asteroids, Earth, and a whole lot more! Similar to 
previous years, the JMARS team will be staffing an exhibition booth in 
the poster hall on Monday, Tuesday, and Thursday nights as well as most 
of the normal conference hours. Come by to say hello, ask questions, 
get technical support, or give us your opinions about everything we've 
done or not done thus far.

This year we will also be hosting a JMARS Showcase at noon on Wednesday, 
March 23rd in Waterway 6-8. The JMARS Showcase will feature a series of 
short presentations by actual scientists (not our usual techies) 
demonstrating how to complete actual scientific tasks. If you haven't 
used JMARS in a while, want a quick refresher, or just want to see what 
we've slipped in since the last time, please join us.

If you want to know more about JMARS 2035, please visit our poster 
(JMARS Software Development for NASA's 2035 Human Landing Site 
Assessment) on Thursday evening.

If you can't make it to LPSC, or have questions, concerns or technical 
issues before, during, or after the conference, we can always be 
reached at help@jmars.asu.edu.
