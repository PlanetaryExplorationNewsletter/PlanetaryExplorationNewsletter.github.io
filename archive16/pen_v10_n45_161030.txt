2017 AMERICAN ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY DIVISION OF DYNAMICAL ASTRONOMY 
MEETING (AAS-DDA)

Sunday June 11 - Thursday June 15, 2017 at Queen Mary University of 
London, United Kingdom.

The annual DDA Meeting brings together top researchers in astronomy, 
astrophysics, planetary science, and astrodynamics for in-depth and 
stimulating discussions and talks on all aspects of dynamics in the 
space sciences. Prof. Rosemary F. G. Wyse (FRAS) will be honoured at 
the 2017 meeting with the AAS-DDA Brouwer Award. The DDA meeting 
features invited talks on a range of topics, contributed talks (with 
no parallel sessions), and posters that can be displayed throughout 
the entire meeting. The 2017 DDA meeting is being co-sponsored by 
the Royal Astronomical Society.

We hope to see you in London next June.

[NASA] PLANETARY SCIENCE VISION 2050 WORKSHOP
 
NASA's Planetary Science Division (PSD) is planning to host a 
community workshop at NASA headquarters in Washington, DC on February 
27-28 and March 1, 2017. This workshop is meant to provide PSD with a 
very long-range vision of what planetary science may look like in the 
future. The workshop is to gather the leading experts in Solar System 
planetary science and related disciplines, together with experts in 
space technologies, to identify potential science goals and enabling 
technologies that can be implemented by the end of the 2040s and would 
support the next phase of Solar System exploration.

JUNO-SUPPORTING POSTDOCTORAL POSITION, JPL/CALTECH POSTDOCTORAL PROGRAM

The California Institute of Technology (Caltech), Postdoctoral Scholars 
Program at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) invites applications for 
a postdoctoral research position in JPL's Planetary Science Section.

The research will involve coordination of Earth-based supporting 
observations for the Juno mission and Juno observations themselves. 
Dr. Glenn Orton, in JPL's Planetary and Exoplanetary Atmospheres Group, 
will serve as JPL postdoctoral advisor to the selected candidate. The 
appointee will carry out research in collaboration with the JPL 
advisor, resulting in publications in the open literature. 

Candidates should have a recent PhD in planetary science with a strong 
background in atmospheres. Experience in radiative transfer and 
spacecraft observations is highly desirable. Candidates who have 
received their PhD within the past five years since the date of their 
application are eligible. Postdoctoral Scholar positions are awarded 
for a minimum of one-year period and may be renewed up to a maximum of 
three years.
