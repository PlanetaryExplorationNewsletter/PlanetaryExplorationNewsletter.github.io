NEW HORIZONS KUIPER BELT EXTENDED MISSION SCIENCE PLANNING OPPORTUNITY

The centerpiece of the proposed New Horizons Kuiper Belt Extended
Mission (NH-KEM) is the very close flyby of the 20-40 km wide KBO
2014 MU69 on 1 January 2019. NH-KEM will also observe ~20 other KBOs
at phase angles and/or at resolutions not otherwise possible,
producing a unique database of KBO phase curves, satellite searches,
and ring searches.

On July 1 NASA approved the NH-KEM, which included plans to reach out 
to the planetary community for ideas to optimize the scientific return. 
The NH Project is holding two KEM WebEx workshops, one from 1-3 pm EDT 
on Sep 13 and one from 1-4 pm EDT on Oct 10, to discuss potential 
community involvement in the NH-KEM. If you're interested in 
participating in these workshops, please send an email ASAP to the NH 
Project Scientist, Hal Weaver (hal.weaver@jhuapl.edu). He will then 
provide you with further details about these workshops.

[NASA] ANNOUNCEMENT OF UPCOMING ASTEROID REDIRECT MISSION OPPORTUNITIES

NASA's Asteroid Redirect Mission Umbrella for Partnerships (ARM-UP) 
Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) will seek proposals in research areas 
including partner-provided investigations through systems or payloads 
to be hosted on the robotic segment of the ARM; collaboration through 
the ARM Investigation Team to support definition of additional mission 
investigations; studies to define mission partnership opportunities 
toward NASA's planned crewed mission to the multi-ton asteroid boulder; 
and opportunities for access and experimentation at the asteroid 
boulder after the crewed mission.

The full BAA Solicitation, with two appendices, is expected to be 
issued in early September. The ARM-UP BAA will remain open until August 
2018, with additional opportunities announced as appendices with their 
own applicable requirements and milestones. 

The first two appendices issued under the omnibus solicitation will be 
released at the same time as the umbrella BAA. Synopses of the 
appendices are available on FedBizOpps at:

Appendix A (NNH16ZCQ002K-HP), Hosted Payloads on Asteroid Redirect 
Robotic Mission:

MARS PLASMA PHYSICIST SOUGHT

The University of Iowa Department of Physics and Astronomy is seeking 
a plasma physicist to conduct research on the Martian ionosphere and 
its interaction with the solar wind using the ionospheric radar (code 
name MARSIS) on the Mars Express spacecraft. The primary emphasis of 
this research is to carry out collaborative investigations with the 
MAVEN spacecraft which is also conducting ionospheric and solar wind 
interaction studies in orbit around Mars.

GEOLOGIC MAPPING SUBCOMMITTEE SEEKING STUDENT MEMBER

The Geologic Mapping Subcommittee (GEMS) of the Mapping and Planetary 
Spatial Infrastructure Team (MAPSIT) is seeking a Student Member to 
join the committee, which advises NASA on issues related to the 
geological mapping of planetary surfaces. We are seeking either a 
current Ph.D. graduate student working a geological map for eventual 
publication by the USGS, or a recent Ph.D. graduate (within one year 
of degree attainment) working a a geological map.

To apply, we request a CV and answers to these questions:

a) what is your experience in planetary geologic mapping and what role 
in your graduate research will/does planetary geologic mapping play?

b) are you able to attend the annual meeting of planetary geologic 
mappers (June) and LPSC in the next 2-3 years?

c) why would you like to serve on GEMS?

Please send your application to the GEMS Chair, Dr. David A. Williams 
at David.Williams@asu.edu by September 30, 2016.

[NASA] NEW PROGRAM: PLANETARY SCIENCE DEEP SPACE SMALLSAT STUDIES

This program element supports the study of spaceflight mission concepts 
that can be accomplished using small spacecraft, including CubeSats. 
NASA's Planetary Science Program is considering including small 
secondary payloads on every future planetary science launch. As such, 
studies performed under this program element will provide valuable 
information to assist future Announcement of Opportunity planning and 
NASA's development of small spacecraft technologies relevant to deep 
space science investigations.

In order to advance the objectives outlined in the Science Plan, 
proposed investigations may target any body in the Solar System, 
including near Earth objects (NEO's), except for the Earth and Sun. 
Investigations of extra-solar planets are not included in this 
program element.

Notices of Intent are due September 30, 2016 and proposals are due 
November 18, 2016.

Questions concerning this program element may be directed to Carolyn 
Mercer at cmercer@nasa.gov.

FIRST ANNOUNCEMENT OF ASTROBIOLOGY 2017

November 26 - December 1, 2017  
Coyhaique, Chile

http://www.astrobiology2017.org/

Astrobiology is an interdisciplinary subject at the frontier of 
science. Current research in astrobiology draws researchers from the 
fields of astronomy, space science, chemistry, biology, geology, 
humanities, sociology and ethical issues.

Many astronomers in the subfields of star formation, solar system 
studies, astrochemistry and others, tend to gather around 
Astrobiology. Science goals of new generation telescopes such as ALMA, 
SKA, TMT, GMT, E-ELT include search for prebiotic molecules, and 
detection of bio-signatures in the ever growing sample of extrasolar 
planets, many of which reside in the habitable zones. Even dedicated 
flagship space missions have been commissioned, such as the wildly 
successful Kepler mission, which alone has discovered about 2,000 
extrasolar planets, or the soon to be launched TESS and CHEOPS 
missions.

The IAU Commission F.3 (Astrobiology) will meet again in the beautiful 
town, Coyhaique, Chile in November, 2017. This key meeting fosters 
interdisciplinary collaborations for the advancement of Astrobiology, 
welcoming researchers from disciplines as diverse as astrophysics, 
biology, geology, humanities, and sociology, among others.

Those who are interested in Astrobiology 2017 are kindly requested to 
keep your schedule!

Masatoshi Ohishi 
Vice-President, IAU Commission F.3
