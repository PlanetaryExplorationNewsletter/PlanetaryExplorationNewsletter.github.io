POSTDOCTORAL SCIENTIST: PLANETARY ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY MODELING

Columbia University: 2-year Postdoctoral Research Scientist 
appointment to model planetary atmospheric chemistry and aerosol 
processes in a general circulation model.

The successful candidate will join a team from the Goddard Institute 
for Space Studies (GISS), GSFC, Columbia University, and other 
institutions as part of the Nexus for Exoplanet System Science 
(https://nexss.info). Team research addresses the habitability of past 
Solar System and exoplanet climates and informs exoplanet mission 
design. The candidate will be expected to perform original research, 
present results at scientific meetings, and publish first-author 
peer-reviewed papers. The candidate will be resident at NASA GISS in 
New York City.

Requirements: PhD. in atmospheric science, chemistry, planetary 
science, astrobiology, or a similar field. Expertise in atmospheric 
chemistry and willingness to become involved in chemistry-aerosol 
parameterization development are required, but the broad scope of 
the project allows for many possible research directions and 
collaborations in studying atmospheric composition impacts on a 
variety of climates using the model. Strong mathematics and 
programming skills are also required. For further information 
contact Anthony DelGenio (anthony.d.delgenio@nasa.gov).

Columbia University is an Equal Opportunity/Affirmative Action 
employer. Applications will be accepted until the position is 
filled. For details visit:

[NASA] DRAFT NEW FRONTIERS PROGRAM AO RELEASED

The New Frontiers Program conducts Principal Investigator (PI)-led 
space science investigations in SMD's planetary programs under a 
not-to-exceed cost cap for the PI-Managed Mission Cost (PMMC). At 
the conclusion of Phase A concept studies, it is planned that one 
investigation will be selected to continue. Investigations must 
address NASA's planetary science objectives as described in 2014 
NASA Strategic Plan and the 2014 NASA Science Plan. Both documents 
are available at:

http://science.nasa.gov/about-us/science-strategy/

Investigations are limited to six mission themes:

* Comet Surface Sample Return,
* Lunar South Pole-Aitken Basin Sample Return,
* Ocean Worlds (Titan and/or Enceladus),
* Saturn Probe,
* Trojan Tour and Rendezvous, and
* Venus In Situ Explorer.

Please see:

Solicitation: NNH16ZDA008J

The draft AO will be based on the recent Discovery AO, as well
 as the Standard PI-led Mission AO Template available at:
 
http://soma.larc.nasa.gov/standardao/index.html

Comments on the draft AO should be sent to Curt Niebur.

Timeframe:
Release of draft AO: August 2016
Comment period closes: September 30, 2016
Release of final AO:January 2017 (target)
Proposals due: April 2017

Further information will be posted at:

[NASA] NEW FOP SOLICITATION DUE 9 SEPTEMBER

NSRC Community,

NASA's STMD Flight Opportunities Program (FOP) has released its 
latest solicitation for suborbital technology demonstration missions.

Formally titled "NASA Flight Opportunities (FO): Technology Advancement 
Utilizing Suborbital Flight Opportunities". This program seeks 
proposals to demonstrate crosscutting space technologies in relevant 
space-like environments using currently available U.S. commercial 
reduced-gravity, high-altitude balloon, and suborbital reusable flight 
opportunities. It strategically invests in the growth of the commercial 
spaceflight market while helping advance technologies that will enable 
future space missions for science and exploration.

NSRC strongly supports the FOP program and encourages you to consider 
proposing to it; we also encourage you to share this news with other 
who you think might find it useful.  

Applications for the solicitation are due September 9th.

NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES SPACE STUDIES BOARD REVIEW OF NASA'S 
PLANETARY SCIENCE DIVISION'S RESTRUCTURED RESEARCH AND ANALYSIS PROGRAM

The Space Studies Board has convened an ad hoc committee to examine the
program elements of NASA's Planetary Science Division (PSD) Research
and Analysis (R&A) programs, as they currently exist following 
restructuring, for their consistency with past advice from the 
Academies. The committee will hold its second meeting August 16-18, 
2016 in Washington, DC.
