SBAG: MEETING REGISTRATION AND OPEN STEERING COMMITTEE POSITIONS

The 15th meeting of the Small Bodies Assessment Group (SBAG) will be 
held June 28 to midday June 30, 2016, at the Johns Hopkins University 
Applied Physics Laboratory in Laurel, MD. Registration and details 
for the meeting are available on the SBAG website:

http://www.lpi.usra.edu/sbag/

The SBAG Steering Committee is composed of members who represent the 
diverse nature of the small bodies community, and each member serves 
a multi-year term. There are three positions open starting in 
August 2016:

* SBAG Planetary Defense Lead - Lead SBAG activities relating to 
topics of planetary defense.

* Outer Solar System Small Bodies Expert - Provide specific expertise 
related to the science of small bodies in the outer Solar System.

* Member with any expertise relevant to SBAG - The Steering Committee 
represents a broad cross-section of the small bodies community and 
seeks potential members who are interested in small bodies topics, 
regardless of specific expertise.

For more details about the positions, visit the SBAG website above. 
To indicate your willingness to serve in any of these positions, 
please email incoming SBAG Chair Tim Swindle 
(tswindle@lpl.arizona.edu) by June 23, 2016, and include a two- to 
four-page CV.

NEW HORIZONS KUIPER BELT EXTENDED MISSION SCIENCE PLANNING OPPORTUNITY

The centerpiece of the proposed New Horizons Kuiper Belt Extended 
Mission (NH-KEM) is the very close flyby of the 20-40 km wide KBO 
2014 MU69 on 1 January 2019. NH-KEM will also observe ~20 other KBOs 
at phase angles and/or at resolutions not otherwise possible, 
producing a unique database of KBO phase curves, satellite searches, 
and ring searches. 

If NH-KEM is approved, mission schedules require that both distant 
KBO observations and MU69 close flyby planning must begin almost 
immediately. 

The New Horizons team plans to use a portion of its September Science 
Team Meeting the week of Sep 19 to gather community input to NH-KEM 
observation plans.

Those are interested in listening to or potentially presenting at 
this activity should complete the indication of interest form at:

6TH PAOLO FARINELLA PRIZE, 2016

To honor the memory and the outstanding figure of Paolo Farinella 
(1953-2000), an extraordinary scientist and person, a prize has been 
established in recognition of significant contributions given in the 
fields of interest of Paolo, which span from planetary sciences to 
space geodesy, fundamental physics, science popularization, security 
in space, weapons control and disarmament.

The prize has been proposed during the "International Workshop on 
Paolo Farinella the Scientist and the Man", held in Pisa in 2010, 
and is supported by the following Italian

Institutions: University of Pisa, ASI, INAF and IFAC-CNR.

The 6th Paolo Farinella Prize is devoted to the "Applications of 
Celestial Mechanics to the natural bodies of our solar system". The 
award ceremony will be hosted by the European Planetary Science 
Congress (EPSC) at the joint DPS-EPSC Meeting that will be held in
Pasadena, CA (USA) from 16 to 21 October 2016.

Send nominations to: Alessandra Celletti, chair of the Prize 
Committee, and Giovanni Valsecchi (co-promoter of the prize) by 
email not later than 30 June 2016, at: 

celletti@mat.uniroma2.it and giovanni@iaps.inaf.it

Please contact G.B. Valsecchi at giovanni@iaps.inaf.it for additional

ASTEROID SCIENCE INTERSECTIONS WITH IN-SPACE MINE ENGINEERING 
(ASIME) 2016 

Luxembourg Abbaye Neumunster, 21-22 September 2016

In keeping with the Luxembourg government's new initiative:

http://www.gouvernement.lu/5678423/Press-conference-Space
Resources_lu-Transcript.pdf

to support the future use of space resources, a workshop is being 
held this Fall in Luxembourg city.

The goal of this two-day workshop of roughly 30-60 scientists and
engineers is to have detailed discussions of the specific properties
of asteroids in the context of the engineering needs of space
missions with in-space asteroid utilisation. The main sessions are
organized by regional -- remote, surface, subsurface -- asteroid
science using experts in those domains to lead the sessions.
Individuals, space agencies, for-profit and non-profit companies are
welcome to participate or listen. A White Paper of approximate
answers to questions from the asteroid miners will be one tangible
outcome.

Current support for the ASIME 2016 workshop is provided by the
Luxembourg Ministry of the Economy, Europlanet, the University of
Luxembourg, and ESA.

Abstract deadline: August 15, 2016
Registration deadline: September 5, 2016

We are looking forward to meeting you in Luxembourg City!

SECOND ANNOUNCEMENT OF THE 2016 EDITION OF THE IAC WINTER SCHOOL

This announcement is to remind you of the XXVIII Edition of the IAC 
Winter School, organized by the Instituto de Astrofisica de Canarias 
and focused on the exploration of the Solar System. The school will 
be held in the UNESCO word heritage city of San Cristobal de La Laguna, 
in Tenerife (Canary Islands, Spain) in November, 7-16, 2016.

The school is intended for post-graduate students in Astrophysics/
Planetary Sciences completing their PhD, and also to young postdocs. 
It is limited to 50 participants, and will provide several advanced 
courses in specific topics like planetary space missions, asteroids, 
comets, origin and evolution of the Solar System and a small workshop 
on planetary data archiving and image processing.

The students will have the opportunity to present a poster with their 
recent work. 

Registration deadline is June, 15st.

The Planetary Photogrammetry Guest Facility at the Astrogeology 
Science Center of the U.S. Geological Survey would like to announce its 
Call for Participation for a training opportunity on July 25-27, 2016.  
This training will cover photogrammetric processing of planetary stereo
imagery using USGS Integrated Software for Imagers and Spectrometers 
and SOCET SET software developed by BAE Systems. The training is FREE 
to participants, and will cover end-to-end, hands-on photogrammetric 
procedures for surface extraction (i.e., digital elevation model 
generation) from Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter HiRISE image pairs. For 
additional information and application instructions, please see:

GSA ANNUAL MEETING 2016 SESSION T172. TECTONIC, VOLCANIC, AND 
VOLCANOTECTONIC PROCESSES ON ROCKY PLANETARY BODIES

We invite contributions to a special session on tectonic, volcanic, 
and volcanotectonic processes on rocky planetary bodies at the 2016 
GSA Annual Meeting in Denver, CO, September 25-28.

Volcanism and tectonism are two of the most ubiquitous processes at 
work in the Solar System, shaping substantially the surfaces of the 
terrestrial planets. Through a combination of solicited and
contributed presentations, this session will host observational, 
laboratory, theoretical, or analogue research into any aspect of 
planetary volcanic and tectonic activity. We particularly welcome 
submissions that compare landforms and processes on multiple bodies, 
and how lessons from specific studies can be applied to understanding 
volcanism and tectonism across the inner Solar System and beyond.

Please consider submitting an abstract for this session. For more 
information, visit: 

https://gsa.confex.com/gsa/2016AM/cfp.epl

The submission deadline is July 12, 2016.

Conveners:
Paul Byrne (North Carolina State University)
Christian Klimczak (University of Georgia)

We look forward to seeing you in Denver.

POSTDOCTORAL FELLOWSHIP OPPORTUNITY WITH NASA'S NEXUS FOR EXOPLANET 
SYSTEM SCIENCE (NEXSS)

The NASA Postdoctoral Program (NPP) offers U.S. and international 
scientists the opportunity to conduct important research while 
contributing to NASA's scientific goals. Applications are now being 
accepted for postdoctoral fellows to engage in research with NASA's 
Nexus for Exoplanet System Science (NExSS) advisors.

NExSS is a NASA research coordination network dedicated to the study 
of planetary habitability. The goals of NExSS are to investigate the 
diversity of exoplanets and to learn how their history, geology, and 
climate interact to create the conditions for life:

https://nexss.info/

NExSS investigators also strive to put planets into an architectural 
context - as solar systems built over the eons through dynamical 
processes and sculpted by stars. 

The NASA Postdoctoral Program application deadline is July 1, 2016. 
To encourage greater collaboration across the disciplines 
represented by the NExSS teams, applicants to this research 
opportunity are required to identify a project that will contribute 
to two teams. Specifically, the applicant must identify a primary 
and a secondary advisor - one from each of the two NExSS groups. 
Please see NExSS NPP for more information.
