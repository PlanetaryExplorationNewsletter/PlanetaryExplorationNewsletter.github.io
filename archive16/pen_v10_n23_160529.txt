[NASA] APPROVAL TO EXCEED PER DIEM LODGING FOR DPS 48/EPSC 11

The three hotels for which the AAS/DPS has reserved room blocks for the 
DPS48/EPSC11 conference on October 16-21, 2016, exceed the GSA lodging 
limit of $150 (plus tax). After reviewing the situation, I hereby 
affirm that for DPS48/EPSC11, travelers whose NASA SMD grants, 
cooperative agreements and contracts are subject to the Federal Travel 
Regulations may be reimbursed up to $199 plus tax per night. People 
with NASA contracts should confirm with their contracting officer. This 
waiver does not supercede the travel policy of an institution that is 
more restrictive.

EARLY CAREER PARTICIPANT SUPPORT AVAILABLE FOR NASA OUTER PLANETS
ASSESSMENT GROUP MEETING

NASA's Outer Planets Assessment Group will provide travel grants for a 
limited number of interested Early Career participants to attend the 
OPAG meeting August 11-12 in Flagstaff, AZ. These individuals may also 
attend the Roadmap for Ocean Worlds meeting on August 10. OPAG plays a 
key role in sculpting the planetary science community's input into NASA 
activities for outer planets science and exploration. Thus, it is 
critical for Early Career scientists to attend these meetings both to 
learn how NASA and Planetary Science programs operate and to represent 
the community that will work on OPAG-relevant projects in the coming 
decade. Interested graduate students, postdocs, and other Early Career 
scientists (within 5 years of PhD/MS/BS) should submit a one page 
letter of interest and a CV to britneys@eas.gatech.edu by June 15, 
2016. Recipients will be notified by June 27. For more information, 
email Britney Schmidt at the address above.

8TH INTERNATIONAL WORKSHOP ON PLANETARY, SOLAR AND HELIOSPHERIC RADIO 
EMISSIONS (PRE VIII)

Seggauberg, Austria (near Graz, Austria)
2016 October 25-27
http://pre8.oeaw.ac.at

Key topics of our workshop are the recent developments in the study of 
non-thermal radio emissions from the Sun, the five radio planets, the 
heliosphere, and potential radio emissions from exoplanets. Special 
emphasis is put on current missions like Cassini and Juno, but also 
new findings from data of older missions like Stereo, Voyager, 
Galileo, Wind or Ulysses are welcome. Studies of terrestrial radio 
emission data from missions like MMS, Themis, Cluster or Demeter will 
be another important topic. In addition to space-based observations, 
new developments in ground-based radio telescope will be matters of 
discussion, that should lead to a better coordination of ground- and 
space-based observations. Presentations should focus on physical 
properties of radio emissions like rotational modulation, fine 
structures in dynamic spectra, polarization as well as source 
direction, and theoretical modeling and simulation of plasma and 
magnetic processes leading to their generation. Key question for 
future missions like Solar Orbiter or JUICE (Jupiter Icy Moons 
Explorer) can also be addressed. Oral as well as poster presentations 
are welcome.

RESEARCH SCIENTIST IN PLANETARY RADAR (427-1100)

The Universities Space Research Association (USRA) is seeking 
applicants for a Research Scientist position in the Planetary Radar 
group at the Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico. The research emphasis 
of the group is the study and characterization of near-Earth objects 
and other Solar System bodies. Experience and interest in astronomical 
observations of Solar System objects, small-bodies geophysics, 
astronomical instrumentation, and/or numerical inverse modeling are 
desirable. Experience with radar observations and techniques, 
programming languages, and Linux systems is preferred, but not 
required. Applications from members of underrepresented groups are 
particularly encouraged. Go to:

LUNAR AND SMALL BODIES GRADUATE CONFERENCE 2016 

Abstract Submission Deadline: June 3, 2016

Registration is now open for the 7th Annual Lunar and Small Bodies 
Graduate Conference (LunGradCon 2016) to be held on Tuesday, July 19, 
2016 at the NASA Ames Research Center, preceding the NASA Exploration 
Science Forum (ESF). With the expanded interests of the Solar System 
Exploration Research Virtual Institute (SSERVI), the scope of this 
year's LunGradCon includes both lunar and small bodies science. 
LunGradCon provides an opportunity for grad students and early-career 
postdocs to present their research on lunar and small body science in 
a low-stress, friendly environment, being critiqued only by their 
peers. In addition to oral presentations, the conference presents 
opportunities for professional development and networking with fellow 
grad students and postdocs, as well as senior members of SSERVI. A 
limited amount of funding will be provided for travel and lodging 
costs. The deadline for registration and abstract submission is June 
3rd 2016, 11:59 PM PDT.

RESEARCH SCIENTIST POSITIONS AT EARTH LIFE SCIENCE INSTITUTE (ELSI)

Earth Life Science Institute (ELSI) at Tokyo Institute of Technology
invites applications for ELSI Research Scientist positions. We are
offering up to 5 positions in this recruitment.

ELSI aims to answer the fundamental questions of how the Earth was
formed, how life originated in the environment of early Earth, and how
this life evolved into complexity. ELSI pursues these questions by
studying the "origin and evolution of life" and the "origin and
evolution of the Earth" through an interdisciplinary collaboration
between the fields of Earth, Life, and Planetary Sciences. By
understanding the early Earth context we work to establish a greater
understanding of the likelihood of life throughout the universe.

ELSI seeks talented, highly motivated individuals who pursue original
research and actively engage in cross-disciplinary discussions and
synergistic research projects. ELSI is a truly integrative institute,
with a genuine commitment to bridging diverse disciplines.

The appointment will be for 3 years, with a possible extension to 5
based on performance and the direction of ELSI. Candidates must hold a
PhD from an accredited institution in a field relevant to ELSI's
research at the time of appointment.

GSA SESSION T168: PAST AND PRESENT BIOSIGNATURE RECOGNITION ON EARTH, 
MARS, AND BEYOND

Abstract deadline: July 12
GSA meeting: September 25-28
Denver, Colorado

Diagnosing and interpreting biosignatures is dependent on whether the 
biota is extant or preserved in the rock record. This forum will 
discuss advances in the search for life focusing specifically on Earth 
and Mars.

CALL FOR PARTICIPATION - SOCET SET TRAINING OPPORTUNITY

The Planetary Photogrammetry Guest Facility at the Astrogeology Science 
Center of the U.S. Geological Survey would like to announce its Call 
for Participation for a training opportunity on July 25-27, 2016. This 
training will cover photogrammetric processing of planetary stereo 
imagery using USGS Integrated Software for Imagers and Spectrometers 
and SOCET Set software developed by BAE Systems. The training is FREE 
to participants, and will cover end-to-end, hands-on photogrammetric 
procedures for surface extraction (i.e., digital elevation model 
generation) from Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter HiRISE image pairs. For 
additional information and application instructions, please see: 

http://astrogeology.usgs.gov/facilities/photogrammetry-guest-facility

[NASA] PLANETARY PROTECTION RESEARCH PROGRAM ELEMENT TEMPORARILY TBD

Planetary protection involves preventing biological contamination on 
both outbound and sample return missions to other planetary bodies. 
Numerous areas of research in astrobiology/exobiology are improving our 
understanding of the potential for survival of Earth microbes in 
extraterrestrial environments, relevant to preventing contamination of 
other bodies by organisms carried on spacecraft. Research is required 
to improve NASA's understanding of the potential for both forward and 
backward contamination, how to minimize it, and to set standards in 
these areas for spacecraft preparation and operating procedures. 
Improvements in technologies and methods for evaluating the potential 
for life in returned samples are also of interest.

The Planetary Science Division plans to compete the Planetary 
Protection Research program element in ROSES-2016 (NNH16ZDA001N), 
but the status has been temporarily changed to TBD. The final NOI and 
proposal due date for this program element will be released as an 
amendment to ROSES-2016. Proposals will be due no earlier than 90 
days after the release of the amendment.
