IN MEMORIAM: ANDRE BRAHIC (1942-2016)

From DPS Newsletter (https://dps.aas.org/news/andre-brahic-1942-2016),
Athena Coustenis

The planetary community, and in particular his French colleagues and 
friends, are very sad to announce the passing of Andre Brahic. 
Professor at the University Paris-Diderot, based at the Observatory of 
Paris until 1995 and the AIM laboratory at CEA Saclay, Andre Brahic 
devoted most of his career to the study of solar system bodies, in 
particular of planetary rings and the formation of planets, but started 
out by working on the chaos theory, the dynamics of galaxies and the 
supernovas. He was a member of the scientific teams of the cameras on 
Voyager 1 and 2, through which he made many discoveries and notably 
confirmed the existence of Neptune rings and the arcs of the Adams 
ring, that he had predicted. With an international team, he showed that 
the Adams ring, is actually composed of four arcs that he and his 
collaborators baptized "Courage", "Liberte", "Egalite", "Fraternite" 
(CLEF for "KEY" in French). He was also a [Cassini science team 
member] ... Andre Brahic was of course also an extraordinary 
communicator, who transmitted his passion for science and astrophysics 
to generations of students and to the public.

[NASA] PDS: NEOWISE DIAMETERS AND ALBEDOS DATA RELEASE

The Planetary Data System (PDS) is pleased to announce the availability 
of a data set containing a compilation of published diameters, optical 
albedos, near-infrared albedos, and beaming parameters for minor 
planets and other bodies detected by NEOWISE during the fully 
cryogenic, 3-band cryo, post-cryo and NEOWISE-Reactivation Year 1 
operations. The data set includes near-Earth asteroids, Main Belt 
asteroids, active Main Belt objects, Hildas, Jupiter Trojans, Centaurs, 
Comets, and Jovian and Saturnian irregular satellites.

WHITE PAPER ON THE VALUE OF PARTICIPATING SCIENCE PROGRAMS ON NASA 
PLANETARY MISSIONS

Dear colleagues,

On behalf of the Assessment/Advisory Groups (OPAG, MEPAG, VEXAG, SBAG, 
LEAG and CAPTEM), we are preparing a white paper about the value of 
Participating Science programs on NASA planetary missions, and how the 
usefulness of such programs might be maximized. This white paper will 
be delivered to NASA and made available to the scientific community.

To help with the study, we have prepared a survey to gather opinions 
and perceptions about Participating Scientist programs and 
experiences.

(Please note, we consider Guest Investigators and Interdisciplinary 
Scientists to also be a type of Participating Scientist). Please 
consider responding to this survey whether or not you have been a 
Participating Scientist on a NASA mission. We will be contacting 
mission Principle Investigators and Project Scientists separately about 
their experiences, but all are welcome to fill out this survey; please 
answer as many or as few questions as you wish.

If you have any questions about the survey or the white paper, please 
contact Louise.Prockter@jhuapl.edu.

[NASA] PDS: LUNAR RECONNAISSANCE ORBITER DATA RELEASE 26

The NASA Planetary Data System is pleased to announce a new delivery of 
Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) data for the following instruments:  

CRaTER 
DLRE 
LAMP 
LEND 
LOLA 
LROC 

This release includes a complete revision of LEND RSCI data products. 
In general, LRO Release 26 includes data collected between December 15, 
2015 and March 14, 2016. To access the above data, please visit the 
following link:  

https://pds.nasa.gov/tools/subscription_service/SS-20160615.shtml

PDS offers two services for searching the LRO archives: The Planetary 
Image Atlas at the Imaging Node allows selection of LRO data by 
specific search criteria: 

http://pds-imaging.jpl.nasa.gov/search/

and the Lunar Orbital Data Explorer at the Geosciences Node allows 
searching and downloading of LRO data and other lunar orbital data 
sets (Clementine and Lunar Prospector):

POSTDOCTORAL POSITION IN MARS SCIENCE

The Department of Planetology and Habitability at the Centro de 
Astrobiologia (CAB) invites applications for a postdoctoral position to 
support investigations on the nature of the early Mars environments. 
The successful candidate will work with Dr. Alberto Fairen in the 
ERC-funded Project "icyMARS":

Applicants should have a recent Ph.D. in the field of Planetary Science 
or related discipline, and a background in Mars research. Expertise in 
Geochemistry or Microbiology would be helpful, but not required.

The position, placed in Madrid, would be for two years, with possible 
extension to a third year contingent upon funding availability and 
satisfactory performance. Benefits include working in a young 
enthusiastic team at one of the leading Planetary Sciences institutions 
in Europe, full social benefits according to the Spanish social care 
system, and a very competitive salary.

Applicants should send a letter of interest, a curriculum with a list
