AGU 2016 SESSION P004: COMETARY PROCESSES IN THE LIGHT OF ROSETTA

Conveners: Bonnie Buratti, Mathieu Choukroun, Matt Taylor, and 
Nicolas Altobelli

The European Space Agency's Rosetta spacecraft will make an 
unprecedented controlled crash onto comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko in 
late September 2016, providing close scrutiny of the comet until the 
very end. This session will focus on scientific results from this final 
stage of Rosetta's life. The session will also include correlative 
studies among instruments from all phases of the mission; studies that 
incorporate ground-based observations for better temporal coverage and 
perspective; theoretical modeling of cometary processes; and 
interrelationships among comets and other small bodies.

AGU abstracts are due no later than 3 August.

AGU 2016 SESSION P006: CRACKING UP - ICE-OCEAN DYNAMICS ON EARTH AND
OCEAN WORLDS

Reminder! Our AGU 2016 session aims to host a fruitful discussion of 
ice-ocean dynamics on Earth and around the solar system. We seek a 
wide range of terrestrial glaciology/oceanography and planetary 
research to foster the Earth-planetary connection.

Ice-fluid interactions are major contributors to the dynamic and often 
unpredictable processes observed across many "ocean worlds," including 
on Earth and the floating shells of distant icy satellites. However, 
our understanding of the physical processes controlling ice-ocean 
interaction remains limited, even on Earth. Bringing together Earth and 
planetary studies of ice-fluid interaction is the aim of this session, 
which invites abstracts focused on dynamic phenomena that arise in ices 
due to ice-fluid interactions. This session is open to contributions 
regarding sea ice, glaciers and ice shelves, icy satellites, Pluto, and 
beyond.

Invited speakers: Kelly Brunt (UMD/NASA) and Ted Scambos (NSIDC)

AGU 2016 SESSION P030: THE EARLY MARS ENVIRONMENT - WARM AND WET, COLD 
AND WET, OR COLD AND ICY?

We invite contributions from climate modeling, geomorphology, 
geochemistry and mineralogy that address the question of whether early 
Mars climate was "warm and wet", "cold and wet" or "cold and icy". This 
session will focus on both sharing new results from different 
perspectives and fostering communication among the community.

AGU 2016 SESSION P032: THE SCIENCE OF EXPLORATION AS ENABLED BY THE 
MOON, NEAR EARTH ASTEROIDS AND THE MOONS OF MARS

Please consider submitting your abstracts to the following 
SSERVI-sponsored AGU Session on lunar/NEO/Phobos/Deimos research.  
Abstracts from the entire community, especially next-gen researchers, 
are encouraged. Abstract deadline is August 3rd, 11:59p EDT.  

AGU Fall 2016 Session: P032. The Science of Exploration as enabled by 
the Moon, Near Earth Asteroids and the moons of Mars.  

A close collaboration between science, technology and exploration 
will enable deeper understanding of the Moon and other airless bodies 
as we move further out of low-Earth orbit. The Solar System 
Exploration Research Virtual Institute (SSERVI) session will focus on 
the scientific aspects of exploration as they pertain to the Moon, 
Near Earth Asteroids (NEAs) and the moons of Mars. This session will 
feature interdisciplinary, exploration-related science centered around 
all airless bodies targeted as potential human destinations. Areas of 
study reported here will represent the broad spectrum of lunar, NEA, 
and Martian moon sciences encompassing investigations of the surface, 
interior, exosphere, and near-space environments as well as science 
uniquely enabled from these bodies. Graduate students and early career 
researchers are particularly encouraged to submit for oral 
presentations.

AGU 2016 SESSION 12855: RADAR INVESTIGATIONS OF PLANETARY SURFACES AND 
SUBSURFACES

We are pleased to announce a new session at the 2016 AGU Fall Meeting
in San Francisco, CA, December 12-16.

Session description: proposed and existing radar instruments are
enabling an unprecedented range of radio geophysical observations of
the surfaces and subsurfaces of solar system bodies. This has spurred
the development and application of new instrumentation, processing,
modeling, analysis, and interpretation approaches to planetary radar
science and engineering. We invite abstracts on any topic involving the
use of radar data to understand planetary bodies. These may describe
(but are not limited to) new results from existing radar observations,
the development and application of new observation or data processing
techniques, numerical modeling of existing or future observations,
and/or the analysis of airborne or orbital radar data from terrestrial
analog studies for solar system observation.

Please consider submitting an abstract for this session. For more
information, visit:

The submission deadline is August 3, 2016.

AGU 2016 SESSION EP024: LINKING SEDIMENT TRANSPORT AND GEOPHYSICAL 
FLOWS TO PLANETARY SURFACE EVOLUTION

Session ID: 13536

Invited Speakers: Edwin Kite (University of Chicago) and 
Tjalling de Haas (Utrecht University)

Planetary missions over the past decade have revealed that while 
planetary bodies across the solar system differ greatly in surface 
conditions, their landscapes share some striking similarities to 
those on Earth. Understanding the feedbacks between how geophysical 
flows and sediment transport processes affect landscape evolution is 
necessary for constraining the current and past climatic conditions 
of planetary surfaces. We invite contributions from research 
exploring these interplays using remote sensing data from surface or 
orbital missions, numerical modeling, laboratory experiments, Earth 
analog studies, or some combination thereof. We expect that a joint 
session between the Planetary Sciences Section and the Earth and 
Planetary Surface Processes Focus Group will foster collaborations 
between those working to understand how geophysical flows and 
sediment fluxes modify our own planet's surface under changing 
climates and those working to understand how surface processes 
behave in places with vastly different conditions and constraints 
from our own.

POSTDOCTORAL POSITIONS: REACTION DYNAMICS & PLANETARY SCIENCES

University of Hawaii at Manoa, USA

The Reaction Dynamics Group, Department of Chemistry, University of 
Hawai'i at Manoa, invites applications for two postdoctoral positions. 
The appointment period is initially for one year, renewable annually 
based on availability of funds and satisfactory progress. Salary is 
competitive, commensurate with experience. Applicants should have a 
strong background in experimental reaction dynamics, UHV techÂ­nology, 
REMPI, and pulsed laser systems. The goal of the experiments is to 
probe the formation of water and hydroxyl radicals on the Moon via 
interaction of ionizing radiation (Solar Wind) with lunar (analog) 
silicates.

Solid communication skills in English (written, oral), a publication
record in internationally circulated, peer-reviewed journals, and 
willingness to work in a team are mandatory. Only self-motivated and 
energetic candidates are encouraged to apply. Please send a letter of 
interest, three letters of recommendation, CV, and publication list to 
Prof. Ralf I. Kaiser, Department of Chemistry, University of Hawai'i at 
Manoa, Honolulu, HI 96822-2275, USA [ralfk@hawaii.edu]. The review of 
applications will start August 1, 2016, and continues until the 
position is filled. A description of our current research group can be

PHD POSITION: EUROPEAN TRAINING NETWORK EUROPAH

A PhD position is available at Astronomy, Leiden University, under 
supervision of Prof. Tielens, in close collaboration with drs. ten Kate 
and King of Earth Sciences, Utrecht University.

Carbonaceous meteorites and comets show a varied organic composition 
thought to reflect, at least partly, a heritage that dates back to 
interstellar clouds. A variety of processes on parent asteroidal bodies 
and comets will have modified any inherited material. PAHs are one key 
component in the interstellar medium. The student will develop models 
for the chemical evolution of PAHs in an aqueous environment and the 
photochemical evolution of ices. S/he will identify chemical markers 
for these processes, make predictions for ALMA and JWST observations, 
and assess the astronomical implications by comparison to meteoritic 
and cometary composition. Secondments are foreseen to Heriot Watt 
University, Aarhus University, and Graphic Science.

The Ideal Candidate has the equivalent of a master's degree in organic 
chemistry, physical chemistry, astronomy, Earth sciences, or physics; 
experimental and computational experience preferably in: Raman and IR 
spectroscopy, density functional theory; a good working knowledge in 
English. Certain restrictions on nationality apply related to mobility 
requirements from the Marie Curie Program.
