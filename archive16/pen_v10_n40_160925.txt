NASA POSTDOCTORAL FELLOWSHIPS

The NASA Postdoctoral Program offers US and international scientists 
the opportunity to advance their research while contributing to NASA's 
scientific goals. The NPP supports fundamental science; explores 
the undiscovered; promotes intellectual growth; and encourages 
scientific connections.

Selected by a competitive peer-review process, NPP Fellows complete 
one- to three-year Fellowship appointments that advance NASA's 
missions in earth science, heliophysics, planetary science, 
astrophysics, space bioscience, aeronautics and engineering, human 
exploration and space operations, and astrobiology.

Current research opportunities in planetary science can be viewed at:

https://npp.usra.edu/opportunities/?filter_keywords=&filter_fields=145

Applicants must have a Ph.D. or equivalent degree in hand before 
beginning the fellowship, but may apply while completing the degree 
requirements. U.S. citizens, Lawful Permanent Residents, and foreign 
nationals eligible for J-1 status as a Research Scholar may apply.

Stipends start at $53,500 per year, with supplements for high cost-
of-living areas and for certain academic specialties. Financial 
assistance is available for relocation and health insurance, and 
$8,000 per year is provided for professional travel.

Applications are accepted three times each year: March 1, July 1, 
and November 1.

RESEARCH POSITION AT THE SWEDISH INSTITUTE OF SPACE PHYSICS

The Solar System Physics and Space Technology research programme at 
the Swedish Institute of Space Physics (IRF) invites applications 
for a temporary research position in Space Physics, related to the 
ESA Rosetta mission to comet 67P Churyumov-Gerasimenko. Applications 
are invited both for a 2-year post-doc position and for shorter 
periods for senior guest scientists.

The advertised position is a research position for studies of the 
cometary plasma environment and its interaction with the solar wind 
primarily using ion data from the Ion Composition Analyzer on board 
Rosetta but also using data from the other instruments that form the 
Rosetta Plasma Consortium (RPC).

Previous experience of working with plasma and/or particle data from 
space missions is required. The position, placed in Kiruna, is 
funded by the Swedish Research Council. Post-doc candidates should 
have completed a PhD during 2013 or later. Candidates planning to 
obtain their PhD degree no later than January 2017 can also apply. 
A post-doc candidate should not currently be an active researcher 
at IRF.

Closing date is 7 October 2016.

curves for 3194 Cepheids and RR Lyrae are also part of the release 
as well as a special astrometric solution for 2152 ICRF quasars.

The goal of this IAU symposium is to ensure the world-wide sharing of
the Gaia mission results that will cover the following topics:
astrometry and reference frames, Milky Way galaxy and stellar physics
and the Solar system bodies. 

The next close deadlines are:

November 1st: IAU grant application

IMPORTANT UPDATES TO NSF GRANT PROGRAMS

James S. Ulvestad, Division Director, NSF Division of Astronomical 
Sciences NSF's Division of Astronomical Sciences (AST) provides the 
following information regarding current funding opportunities. AST is 
beginning a pilot 'no-deadline' program for proposals in 
solar and planetary astronomy. Proposals that address topics related 
to planetary systems - including exoplanets, our own solar system, 
and solar physics - should be submitted in response to the new Solar
and Planetary Research Grants (SPG) solicitation NSF 16-602. These 
proposals may be submitted at any time. Previously, these proposals 
were submitted to the Astronomy and Astrophysics Research Grants (AAG)
program (new solicitation NSF 16-574). Although SPG proposals may be 
submitted any time throughout the year, proposals submitted to SPG 
after 15 November 2016, but judged to be more appropriate for the
AAG program, may be returned without review. If you are unsure 
whether your proposed research fits into SPG, please contact one of 
the program officers listed in the SPG solicitation. For all 
programs, prospective proposers should pay close attention to the 
changes this year in the Grant Proposal Guide, NSF 16-1, which 
describes all requirements except for those superseded specifically 
in an individual solicitation.

ARIZONA-JAXA WORKSHOP

The Institute of Space and Astronautical Science (ISAS) of the Japan 
Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) and the Lunar and Planetary 
Laboratory (LPL) of the University of Arizona will hold a workshop 
dedicated to planetary science enabled by missions launched by the 
Epsilon launcher of JAXA on November 15 and 16, 2016, at LPL in 
Tucson, Arizona. 

Given the nature of the workshop described below, participation 
will be limited to the first 50 registrants. 

ISAS has defined three mission classes by which space science 
will be pursued systematically. 
(A) ISAS strategic L-class missions to be launched by the H-IIA/III 
launcher (such as the Martian Moons eXplorer (MMX), the mission under 
consideration to return samples from Phobos);
(B) ISAS competitive M-class missions to be launched by the Epsilon 
launcher (the topic of this workshop); and
(C) Participation in large-class missions to be led by foreign 
agencies.
