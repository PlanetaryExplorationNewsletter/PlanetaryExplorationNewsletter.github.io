INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON MARS AERONOMY - FIRST ANNOUNCEMENT
 
15-19 MAY 2017
Boulder, Colorado, USA
 
The Mars upper atmosphere, ionosphere, magnetosphere, and solar-wind 
interactions are becoming increasingly important for understanding 
loss of atmosphere to space and the evolution of the Martian climate.  
Recent observations have been made from Mars Express over the last 
decade, from MAVEN for the most-recent Mars year, and from Mars 
Odyssey, the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, and the Mars Orbiter 
Mission; landed spacecraft and earlier orbiters also provided valuable 
information. These missions have provided tremendous new data sets 
that allow us for the first time to describe the behavior of the upper 
atmosphere and plasma environment, understand the underlying physical 
processes, and extrapolate atmospheric loss to past epochs. This 
international conference will bring together all aspects of Mars 
aeronomy, including pertinent observations, analyses, theoretical 
models and results.
  
Details are still being worked out for abstract submission dates and 
registration deadlines and fees. You can check on our web site for

GSA 2016 SESSION T160: SATELLITES OF THE OUTER SOLAR SYSTEM

This year's annual Geological Society of America meeting features 
numerous sessions devoted to planetary sciences. We would like to 
highlight the session titled "Friends of Hoth: Satellites of the Outer 
Solar System" (T160).

We seek abstracts that discuss surface, structural, and tectonic 
processes of the outer icy satellites and their interiors, thermal 
evolutions, and analog studies of those bodies. This session will join 
the numerous other Planetary Geology Division session topics including 
results from Dawn, New Horizons, impact cratering, and planetary 
geologic mapping.

GSA is scheduled for September 25-28 in Denver, Colorado.

Additional information about the GSA meeting can be found at:

http://community.geosociety.org/gsa2016/home

To submit an abstract to our session please visit (Submission Deadline 
July 12th):

If you have any questions, please contact session conveners Emily 
Martin (martines@si.edu) or Alex Patthoff (apatthoff@psi.edu).

GSA 2016 SESSION T161: PLANETARY AEOLIAN PROCESSES

Dear members of the planetary aeolian community,

We would like to invite you to consider submitting your abstracts to
T161. From Bouncing Grains to Cemented Sandstones: Aeolian Processes 
and Stratigraphy in the Solar System.

Conveners: Mathieu G.A. Lapotre, Christy Swann, R. Aileen Yingst

Sponsors: GSA Planetary Geology Division; GSA Sedimentary Geology 
Division

Description: Wind is an important agent of sediment transport on many 
planetary bodies. This session seeks contributions to our understanding 
of aeolian processes and how they inform our interpretation of 
sedimentary rocks in the Solar System.

The last few years have been very exciting for our community, with 
many new datasets and results. We hope you will come and discuss your
latest research with us in Denver, CO. The abstract submission 
deadline is July 12. GSA will be early this year, September 25-28.

GSA 2016 SESSION T164: GEOLOGY OF THE PLUTO SYSTEM

We invite contributions to a special session on the geology of Pluto, 
its large moon Charon, and the smaller satellites Styx, Nix, Kerberos, 
and Hydra, at the 2016 GSA Annual Meeting in Denver, CO, September 
25-28.

The New Horizons mission has revealed surprisingly complex geology 
on the surfaces of Pluto and Charon. This session highlights the 
geological diversity of both bodies, as well as evidence for vigorous, 
ongoing activity on Pluto. By meeting time, most of the encounter data 
will be on the ground, providing an ideal opportunity to synthesize 
what we have learned of the geology of these remote worlds, and to 
compare and contrast processes with those on the Earth, Mars, and icy 
satellites. This session also serves as a companion to the special 
Pardee Symposium on Exploring the Third Zone: The Geology of Pluto, 
Charon, and the Kuiper Belt (P3). 

Please consider submitting an abstract for this session. For more 
information, visit: 

https://gsa.confex.com/gsa/2016AM/cfp.epl

The submission deadline is July 12, 2016.

Conveners:
William B McKinnon (Washington University in St. Louis)
Jeffrey M Moore (NASA Ames Research Center)

We hope to see you in Denver!

GSA 2016 SESSION T165: IMPACT CRATERING ON EARTH AND THROUGHOUT THE 
SOLAR SYSTEM

Sponsored by the GSA Planetary Geology Division; GSA Geophysics 
Division; GSA Mineralogy, Geochemistry, Petrology, and Volcanology 
Division; GSA Quaternary Geology and Geomorphology Division.

This session focuses on the nature of impact craters and processes on 
Earth and other planets. We solicit contributions regarding shock 
processes, modeling, geology, and airbursts. Comparisons among different 
size and composition bodies are encouraged. Abstracts on lunar craters 
are welcome!

Proponents: Christian Koeberl, Jeffrey Plescia

AGU 2016 SESSION P002: ADVANCES IN PLANETARY THERMOPHYSICS

We are pleased to announce a session focussed on planetary 
thermophysics at the 2016 AGU Fall Meeting in San Francisco (December 
12-16, 2016) entitled "Advances in Planetary Thermophysics".

Remote and in-situ surface temperature measurements have been acquired 
on planetary bodies throughout the Solar System for decades, and have 
helped address a wide range of scientific questions related to 
geothermal heat flows, presence and stability of volatiles, regolith 
physical properties, and subsurface heterogeneities.  Recent laboratory 
and modeling advances used in conjunction with ever-improving datasets 
have promoted a host of new scientific investigations and enabled 
exciting results, shedding light on various processes shaping planetary 
surfaces. This session aims at both sharing these new results applied 
(but not limited to) Mercury, Mars, the Moon, Galilean and Saturnian 
satellites, minor bodies, and fostering communication throughout the 
diverse thermal communities.

Deadline to submitting abstracts: Wednesday, 3 August 23:59 EDT.

Conveners: Sylvain Piqueux (JPL), Jean-Pierre Williams (UCLA), 
Jamie Molaro (JPL).
