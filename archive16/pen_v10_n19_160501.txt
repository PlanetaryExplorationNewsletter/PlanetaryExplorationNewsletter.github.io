MARS EXPLORATION ZONE MAP DESIGN COMPETITION

What kind of map is needed to best aid human explorers of Mars? The 
ICA Commission on Planetary Cartography is organizing a competition 
for creating maps to find a suitable landing site. This is an 
international call for designing maps of any of the 47 candidate 2035 
human landing sites on Mars. It is open to students, cartographers, 
and graphic artists from all countries.

The winner will be invited to the 2017 International Cartographic 
Conference in Washington, D.C. Please read the details at:

LUNAR AND SMALL BODIES GRADUATE CONFERENCE 2016 

Abstract submission deadline: June 3

Registration is now open for the 7th Annual Lunar and Small Bodies 
Graduate Conference (LunGradCon 2016) to be held on Tuesday, 
July 19, 2016 at the NASA Ames Research Center, preceding the NASA 
Exploration Science Forum (ESF). With the expanded interests of the 
Solar System Exploration Research Virtual Institute (SSERVI), the 
scope of this year's LunGradCon includes both lunar and small 
bodies science. LunGradCon provides an opportunity for grad students 
and early-career postdocs to present their research on lunar and 
small body science in a low-stress, friendly environment, being 
critiqued only by their peers. In addition to oral presentations, 
the conference presents opportunities for professional development 
and networking with fellow grad students and postdocs, as well as 
senior members of SSERVI. A limited amount of funding will be 
provided for travel and lodging costs. The deadline for 
registration and abstract submission is June 3rd 2016, 11:59 PM PDT.

[NASA] SECOND COMMUNITY ANNOUNCEMENT - NEW FRONTIERS AO

A Second community announcement has been posted regarding the New 
Frontiers Program Announcement of Opportunity giving more details 
about the six mission themes, including their science objectives.
The full text of both the first and second community announcement 
may be viewed at:

[NASA] NEW FRONTIERS PROGRAM JUNE TECHNOLOGY WORKSHOP

PSD plans to host a one-day technology workshop divided into two 
sections: briefings on each technology offering in the morning and 
the opportunity for small-group meetings in the afternoon. The 
workshop is tentatively scheduled for June first or second and 
will be Webcast. The full text of the New Frontiers Program June 
Technology Workshop announcement has been posted at:

[NASA] ADVANCE NOTICE OF NEW PROGRAM ELEMENT: CONCEPTS FOR OCEAN 
WORLDS LIFE DETECTION TECHNOLOGY

PSD expects to release a new program element entitled Concepts 
for Ocean worlds Life Detection Technology (COLDTech) which will 
support the development of technology beneficial for surface and 
subsurface missions to explore ocean worlds such as Europa and 
Enceladus. Specifically, COLDTech will seek to advance the maturity 
of science instruments and sample acquisition and delivery systems 
for such missions. While instruments focused on the detection of 
extant life in the ocean worlds of the outer Solar System are 
especially of interest, COLDTech will not be limited to such 
instruments.

Placeholder text has been posted for this as program element C.20 
of ROSES-2016 and the due dates are listed as TBD. When the final 
text is released it will be via amendment to ROSES-2016. Proposals 
will be due no less than 90 days after release.

Solar System objects, small-bodies geophysics, astronomical 
instrumentation, and/or numerical inverse modeling is desirable. 
Experience with radar observations and techniques, programming 
languages, and Linux systems is preferred but not required. The 
incumbent would be expected to participate in radar observations 
and also carry out an independent research program. The Observatory 
has significant computing facilities. Conference travel and equipment 
support are available. This position shall be for a two year

RESTRUCTURED PSD R&A PROGRAMS, MARS: FEEDBACK REQUESTED BY MAY 9  

Mars community,

Your feedback is requested! Jeff Johnson, MEPAG Chair, has been 
asked by the Space Studies Board (SSB) for the Mars community's 
perspective on the efficacy of NASA's Planetary Science Division 
(PSD) Research and Analysis (R&A) programs. The Mars community 
feedback will comprise a portion of Jeff's presentation to an SSB 
R&A Review Committee. The committee will hold its first meeting at 
the National Academy of Sciences on May 12-13, and has invited 
representatives from all of the PSD analysis groups.
 
In particular, the committee has been tasked to address the following 
questions:

1. Are the PSD R&A program elements appropriately linked to, and do 
they encompass the range and scope of activities needed to support 
the NASA Strategic Objective for Planetary Science and the Planetary 
Science Division Science Goals, as articulated in the 2014 NASA 
Science Plan?

2. Are the PSD R&A program elements appropriately structured to 
develop the broad base of knowledge and broad range of activities 
needed both to enable new spaceflight missions and to interpret 
and maximize the scientific return from existing missions?

Please answer the survey questions by May 9 at:

ASTEROIDS, COMETS, METEORS 2017 - 1ST CIRCULAR

10-14 April 2017
Montevideo, Uruguay

www.acm2017.uy

The series of conferences "Asteroids, Comets, Meteors" focuses on the 
research of small Solar System bodies. The series constitutes the 
leading international meeting in this field. The first three 
conferences took place in Uppsala, Sweden in the 1980's, and 
afterwards they were organized every ~3 years all over the world. 

Next year's meeting will be held in the Edificio Polifuncional Jose 
Luis Massera that belongs to the Universidad de la Republica and is 
located beside the Faculty of Engineering. The building is 
located near the sea coast in a beautiful green area called Parque 
Rodo. There are several hotels and restaurants in the surroundings 
within walking distances. Furthermore, Montevideo downtown is 
only a ten minute drive away. There are several bus lines connecting 
downtown with Parque Rodo. 

For those interested in attending, please, fill the form with your 
personal data. Provide us a tentative title of your contribution 
and/or the subject you are working on:

http://acm2017.uy/x/pre-registration/

Funds are very limited, so we expect to cover some accommodation 
expenses for graduate students and recent PhDs; and it will be 
possible to waive the registration fee for some people needing 
some assistance.
