VOLCANO-LITHOSPHERE INTERACTIONS ON THE TERRESTRIAL PLANETS 
POSTDOCTORAL FELLOWSHIP: LUNAR AND PLANETARY INSTITUTE

The Universities Space Research Association - Houston invites 
applications for a postdoctoral fellowship in geophysical studies of 
the growth/evolution of large volcanic edifices and provinces on the 
terrestrial planets.

The candidate will work with Dr. Patrick McGovern exploring mechanical
interactions between intrusive and extrusive volcanic edifice growth,
lithospheric flexural response, and magma ascent, using numerical
modeling techniques, including Finite Element (FEM) and Distinct 
Element (DEM) Methods. Research will also entail analysis of imagery, 
topography, gravity, and spectral datasets for large planetary 
volcanoes in order to constrain the modeling efforts. Potential 
bodies of interest include Venus, lo, the Moon, Earth, and Mars.

Requirements are a recent Ph.D. in geophysics or geology. Experience 
quantitative modeling of geophysical, geological, or magmatic processes 
with advanced codes as COMSOL Multiphysics (FEM) and PFC (DEM).  
Programming languages, MATLAB or FORTRAN 95 desirable. The position 
is two years with a possible extension to three years.

Send letter of interest, curriculum vita with a list of relevant 
publications, brief statement of research interests, and three 
references to resume@lpi.usra.edu. Further information may be found 
at:

www.lpi.usra.edu

Employer.

NASA POSTDOCTORAL FELLOWSHIPS

The NASA Postdoctoral Program (NPP) offers scientists and engineers 
unique opportunities to conduct research at NASA Centers. Each NPP 
fellowship opportunity is designed to advance NASA research in a 
specific project related to space science, earth science, aeronautics, 
exploration systems, lunar science, astrobiology, or astrophysics.

Applicants must have a Ph.D. or equivalent degree in hand before 
beginning the fellowship, but may apply while completing the degree 
requirements. U. S. citizens, Lawful Permanent Residents, and foreign 
nationals eligible for J-1 status as a Research Scholar may apply.

Stipends start at $50,000 per year, with supplements for high cost-
of-living areas and for certain academic specialties. Financial 
assistance is available for relocation and health insurance, and 
$8,000 per year is provided for professional travel.

Applications are accepted three times each year: March 1, July 1, 
and November 1.

[NASA] JUPITER ICY MOONS EXPLORER (JUICE) SALMON-2 COMMUNITY 
ANNOUNCEMENT

The Science Mission Directorate intends to release a SALMON-2 PEA to 
solicit proposals for instrument investigations to be implemented 
through ESA's JUpiter ICy moons Explorer (JUICE) mission. The total 
payload resources including mass, power, and data for the instrument 
complement will be described in a document in the JUICE Acquisition 
Library. The mission is described in detail in the ESA Science 
Management Plan and the ESA Yellow Book, which will become available 
at:

http://sci.esa.int/juice

and will be linked from the JUICE Acquisition Library when the PEA 
is released.

The scientific objectives of the JUICE mission are:
1) Study Ganymede as a planetary object, including its potential 
   habitability; 
2) Explore Europa's recently active zones; 
3) Study Callisto as a remnant of the early Jovian System; 
4) Explore the Jupiter System as an archetype for gas giants. 

Below is the anticipated schedule of major milestones of the JUICE 
PEA. These dates may change.
 
PEA Release approximately                 June 28, 2012
Preproposal Conference                    Release + ~3 wks
Notice of Intent to Propose due           August 2, 2012
Proposals due                             September 20, 2012
