SUSAN NIEBUR, 1978-2012

Susan Niebur, former NASA Program Scientist and founder of the Women 
in Planetary Science project, passed away on February 6, 2012. For
five years she battled with inflammatory breast cancer while engaging 
relentlessly in space science policy, the history and future of space 
science missions and how they are managed, and encouraging and putting
a spotlight on the role of women in planetary exploration. Throughout,
her greatest passion was for her family.

CRISM DATA USER WORKSHOP

The 2012 MRO/CRISM Data Users' Workshop will be held in association 
with the 43rd Lunar and Planetary Science Conference at The Woodlands 
Waterway Marriott Hotel and Convention Center, The Woodlands, Texas.  
The workshop will be held in the Shenandoah Room, at 1:00 PM - 5:00 PM, 
on Sunday March 18, 2012 (the Sunday afternoon of LPSC week).

The Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO) Compact Reconnaissance Imaging 
Spectrometer for Mars (CRISM) has been in operation since late 2006 
and has acquired over 20,000 high spatial and spectral resolution 
targeted observations of the Martian surface. The 2009 CRISM Data 
Users' Workshop described data products in detail, and trained 
attendees on using CRISM-specific software to analyze the data. 

At this second workshop, CRISM team members will review significant 
updates to PDS-delivered CRISM data products including updated 
radiometric calibrations, and implementation of a data filtering 
procedure that addresses systematic and stochastic instrument noise. 
In addition, new highly derived CRISM data products will be described 
in detail.

All attendees are requested to register for this event, and due to 
available space, attendance will be limited to the first 50 
registrants. To register, please visit the workshop registration site 
at:

1ST INTERPLANETARY CUBESAT WORKSHOP

29-30 May 2012
Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA
http://www.iCubeSat.org

iCubeSat, the Interplanetary CubeSat Workshop, will address the
technical challenges, opportunities, and practicalities of space
exploration with CubeSats. The workshop will provide a unique
environment for open practical collaboration between academic
researchers, industry professionals, policy makers, and students
developing this new and rapidly growing field.

Talks and round tables will focus on three themes: technology,
science, and open collaboration.

Technology: Mason Peck, NASA, Chief Technologist
Science: Sara Seager, MIT, Professor of Physics and Planetary Science

Talks on astrodynamics, attitude control and determination systems,
citizen science, communications, landers, launch opportunities, open
source approaches, outreach, payloads, policy, power systems,
propulsion, reentry systems, ride-shares, science missions, software,
standardization, structures, systems engineering, and other related
topics are all welcome.

1st April 2012  Abstract submission deadline
15th April 2012 Notification of abstract acceptance
28th May 2012   Presentation (and optional paper) upload deadline

Please indicate your interest in presenting or attending as soon as
possible by completing the registration form at:

http://www.iCubeSat.org 

or emailing the organizing committee at
committee@icubesat.org for more information as places are strictly

[NASA] SUPPLEMENTAL EDUCATION AND PUBLIC OUTREACH PROGRAMS CANCELLED

The Supplemental Education and Public Outreach (EPO) Programs were 
designed to allow SMD-funded researchers to design efforts that 
capitalize upon their own talents, interests, and scientific expertise. 
By adding an Education or Outreach component to their research 
investigation, they could engage the public in the excitement of 
NASA's scientific exploration of our home planet, the solar system, and
the rest of the universe through stimulating and informative activities 
that reach a broad and varied audience.
 
The proposed budget for the SMD Education and Public Outreach program 
is fully subscribed with selected activities; additional EPO supplement 
selections cannot be accommodated within the proposed budget. This 
amendment cancels the second (i.e., March 2012) due date for proposals.

[Edited for length.]
[Editor Note: These programs do not appear in the recently released 
2012 ROSES and the larger Opportunities in Education and Public 
Outreach for Earth and Space Sciences program is "Not solicited this
year."]

RADAR IN PLANETARY EXPLORATION - FINAL REMINDER

This is a final reminder for your contribution to Symposium 20.3 "Radar 
in Planetary Exploration" in Theme 20 "Planetary Sciences" at the 
upcoming IGC (International Geological Congress) in Brisbane, 
Australia, August 5-10, 2012. See:

http://www.34igc.org/

GPR and SAR radars contribute to our knowledge of the distribution of 
ice on Earth and Mars, and of the geology of outer solar system 
planetary bodies, such as Titan. This Symposium welcomes contributions 
in all areas of radar technology applied to the remote observation of 
solar system objects.

Keynote Speakers: Stephen WALL (USA) and Roberto SEU (Italy)

The abstract deadline is Friday 17 February 2012. See: 

http://www.34igc.org/submit-abstracts.php

Other planetary sessions include: 

20.1 Surface processes on Mars, 
20.2 Bio-geomarkers and models in astrobiology, 
20.4 Lunar research and exploration in the 21st century, 
20.5 Planets and satellites of the solar system

We look forward to seeing you in Brisbane in August!

NASA POSTDOCTORAL FELLOWSHIPS

The NASA Postdoctoral Program (NPP) offers scientists and engineers 
unique opportunities to conduct research at NASA Centers. Each NPP 
fellowship opportunity is designed to advance NASA research in a 
specific project related to space science, earth science, aeronautics, 
space operations, exploration systems, lunar science, or astrobiology.

Applicants must have a Ph.D. or equivalent degree in hand before 
beginning the fellowship, but may apply while completing the degree 
requirements. U. S. citizens, Lawful Permanent Residents, and foreign 
nationals eligible for J-1 status as a Research Scholar may apply.

Stipends start at $50,000 per year, with supplements for high 
cost-of-living areas and for certain academic specialties. Financial 
assistance is available for relocation and health insurance, and 
$8,000 per year is provided for professional travel.

Applications are accepted three times each year: March 1, July 1, and 
November 1.

9TH INTERNATIONAL PLANETARY PROBE WORKSHOP

The 9th International Planetary Probe Workshop (IPPW-9) will be held 
at the Institut Superieur de l'Aeronautique et de l'Espace (ISAE) in 
Toulouse, France on June 18-22, 2012. The workshop will be preceded by 
a separate two-day short course on "Probe Science Instrumentation 
Technologies", June 16-17, 2012. The goal of the International 
Planetary Probe Workshops is to bring together scientists, 
technologists, engineers, mission designers, and policy makers 
interested in the technological challenges and scientific 
opportunities in the exploration of Solar System atmospheres and 
surfaces using atmospheric entry, descent probes, and aerial vehicles. 
Topics discussed at the workshop include the political, scientific, and 
economic outlook for entry probe missions, the science and technology 
of probes, landers, and penetrators, extreme environment technologies, 
science instrumentation, entry, descent and landing technologies, site 
selection, entry and descent trajectory reconstructions, sample return 
capsules, aerial mobility, and drag, aerobraking and aerocapture 
techniques. A limited number of student travel grants are available. 
The deadline for abstract submission is Thursday, March 1, 2012. 
IPPW-9 is sponsored by NASA, CNES, and ISAE in Toulouse.
