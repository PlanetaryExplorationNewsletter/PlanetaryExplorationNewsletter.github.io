EDITORIAL: NASA PLANETARY R&A PROGRAM SELECTION RATES PLUMMET

Mark V. Sykes
Planetary Science Institute

New awards for planetary R&A programs are recording success rates of
10-12%. From selection letter language, there is no commitment to later 
funding that will significantly increase these success rates. This is a 
policy decision by Planetary Division management. Given the recent 
commitment to a $1.5B MSL2 launching in 2020 (with no science objective 
yet defined - and a mission not called for in the recent decadal 
survey), it is alarming there is no commitment to funding stability for 
these research programs, much less the modest growth called for by the 
decadal survey. Per numerous NRC reports over the years, R&A programs 
are the foundation on which the strategic goals of the US solar system 
exploration program are pursued, missions are defined, and return on the 
tax-payer investment in those missions are gained. We face the prospect 
of losing science capability, particularly among the next generation of 
planetary scientists. This loss is not reversible on short timescales.

Tell me how this will impact you (sykes@psi.edu). I will collect and 
publish your responses (minus personal identification). This can 
significantly impact policymakers.

NEW MEPAG MEETING SCHEDULED FOR FEBRUARY 26-27, 2013 IN ARLINGTON, VA

The 27th meeting of the Mars Exploration Program Analysis Group 
(MEPAG) is scheduled for February 26-27, 2013, at the Holiday Inn 
Rosslyn at Key Bridge in Arlington, VA.

Key discussion topics will include:
-Mars program status, budget, and current missions
-2020 Mars Rover Science Definition Team plans and status
-Current interactions with the Human Exploration organization (HEOMD)
-Planning for future MEPAG work

NASA POSTDOCTORAL FELLOWSHIPS

The NASA Postdoctoral Program (NPP) offers scientists and engineers 
unique opportunities to conduct research at NASA Centers. Each NPP 
fellowship opportunity is designed to advance NASA research in a 
specific project related to space science, earth science, aeronautics, 
exploration systems, lunar science, astrobiology, or astrophysics.

Applicants must have a Ph.D. or equivalent degree in hand before 
beginning the fellowship, but may apply while completing the degree 
requirements. U.S. citizens, Lawful Permanent Residents, and foreign 
nationals eligible for J-1 status as a Research Scholar may apply.

Stipends start at $53,500 per year, with supplements for high 
cost-of-living areas and for certain academic specialties. Financial 
assistance is available for relocation and health insurance, and 
$8,000 per year is provided for professional travel.

Applications are accepted three times each year: March 1, July 1, and 
November 1.

COMETS AS TRACERS OF SOLAR SYSTEM FORMATION AND EVOLUTION

July 9-11, 2013, Toulouse, France

Abstract submission deadline: March 31, 2013
On-line registration deadline: April 30, 2013
Maximum number of participants: 60

A workshop on the role of comets in understanding the formation and  
evolution of the Solar System will be held in Toulouse, France 9-11 
July, 2013. The workshop will cover topics ranging from the dynamical 
and chemical evolution of the solar nebula during formation, to the 
techniques for measuring the composition of comets. We will discuss 
the role that Rosetta measurements will play in understanding the 
origin of Solar System bodies, and what future missions to comets are 
being planned. Abstract submissions for posters and for talks are 
encouraged, though the number of talks available is limited in order 
to keep the meeting to three days. There will be a special issue of 
Planetary and Space Science devoted to the works presented at this 
meeting. For more information see:

VENUS UPPER ATMOSPHERE SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY INTERCHANGE MEETING

A meeting is planned for January 24th, 2013 to discuss Venus upper 
atmosphere investigations. The meeting main purposes are:
           
1. Foster a science discussion on goals, objectives, priorities, and 
significance of the Venus upper atmosphere and how Venus upper 
atmosphere science would contribute to overall exploration of Venus and 
how it may contribute to comparative science
2. Discuss the desired measurements and measurement requirements to 
achieve potential Venus upper atmosphere science
3. Discuss spacecraft concepts and technologies that could reach the 
Venus UA and collect and return the desired data
 
The meeting will be held at the Ohio Aerospace Institute at NASA Glenn 
in Cleveland, Ohio. Attendance at the meeting is free but registration 
is strongly encouraged. Registration and additional information are 
available at: 

http://spaceflightsystems.grc.nasa.gov/SSPO/SP/VenusUpper/workshop.html
 
A tour of the nearly completed NASA Glenn Extreme Environment Rig 
(GEER) will be made available for those arriving the afternoon of the 
23rd. When complete, the GEER will be able to accurately simulate the 
environments in the Venus atmosphere and on its surface.

BIRD'S-EYE VIEW OF VALLES MARINERIS BY ESA MARS EXPRESS

Seen here in new light and online for the first time, this bird's-eye 
view of Valles Marineris was created from data captured during 20 
individual orbits of ESAâ€™s Mars Express. It is presented in near-true 
colour and with four times vertical exaggeration.

PLANETARY RESPONSES TO SALSO RFI NEEDED!

The due date (7 January) for responses to the SALSO call
(science.nasa.gov/salso/) is rapidly approaching. NASA is seeking input 
for what to do with a mirror system from NRO.

Let's not be left out ... Wouldn't it be great if this system could be 
used for planetary observations? We can make that happen with efforts 
from the community to build a strong case for doing so. Please consider 
submitting an abstract (for a planetary science topic, instrument 
concept or mission concept).

We are coordinating efforts for a strong response from the planetary 
science community. Please check out the wiki: 

http://www.giardiacorp.com/pstwiki 

and add information about your abstract, or contact those who have 
already posted to join their effort.
