PLANETARY DIVISION MANAGEMENT RESPONDS TO COMMUNITY CONCERNS

James L. Green, Director, Planetary Science Division

The President's FY13 budget for the Planetary Science Division (PSD) 
was reduced by 21% from its FY12 level. This reduction has not been 
equally distributed throughout the program. For instance our flight 
programs have taken the greatest reduction with the withdrawal of 
significant NASA participation in ESAâ€™s Mars 2016 and 2018 missions, 
and significant changes in the Discovery and New Frontiers flight 
rates. It is a fact that a reduction in Planetary Division funding 
will reduce science with the additional expectation that there will 
be increased proposal pressure in many of the Research and Analysis 
(R&A) programs as missions wind down with no new mission selections 
and participating scientist calls to take their place.

The projected R&A funding for FY13 is planned to be $228M, which is 
more than 19% of the entire Planetary Science budget (a historic high 
percentage). The PSD is following closely previous recommendations 
and findings of the Planetary Science Subcommittee (PSS) to better 
manage its R&A program consistent with funding constraints while
addressing critical R&A issues such as slow notification and budget 
stability. It is important to note that NASA is currently being funded 
under a continuing resolution whose procedures are to provide partial 
funding at regular intervals. Therefore, many of the PSD Program 
Officers (PO) do not currently have all their R&A program funding to 
meet their current commitments and selections. To take this situation 
into account, the following are the PSD R&A management principles:

1. FY13 funding targets have been provided to all program officers 
(PO) for each of the PSD ROSES program elements.

2. All POs will meet current ongoing grants commitments before new 
selections can be made.

3. Awards will be made and announced beginning one month after the 
review panels have met.

4. Section announcements will be either: selected, notselected, or 
selectable.

5. Proposals in the selectable category will be selected as funding 
becomes available throughout the fiscal year. This means that 
selection rates for a program will increase as additional selections 
are announced.

As an example, recent selection announcements in the Planetary 
Astronomy and Planetary Atmosphere R&A programs did not report the 
"selectable" letters that went out to many proposers that would be 
funded as funds become available later in the year.

Contrary to statements being made by some individuals in the science 
community, the recent announcement of the Mars 2020 rover has nothing 
to do with the current R&A selection rates nor has it impacted the 
current or projected amounts to be spent in the R&A program. The Mars 
2020 rover will be designed to "conduct mobile surface-based science 
at a site selected for its ability to preserve evidence of life, and 
prepare for the future return of samples per the NRC Planetary Decadal 
Survey." A call for the membership of the Science Definition Team 
(SDT) for the Mars 2020 rover has just been release. For more 
information on this SDT please see:
