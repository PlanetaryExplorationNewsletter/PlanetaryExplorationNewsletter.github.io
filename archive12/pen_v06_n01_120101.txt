RESEARCH EXPERIENCE FOR UNDERGRADUATES IN ASTROBIOLOGY & PLANETARY 
SCIENCE

The SETI Institute is pleased to announce that applications are now 
open for the 2012 REU (Research Experiences for Undergraduates) program 
in Astrobiology and Planetary Science. Undergraduate students in fields
such as astronomy, biology, geology, chemistry, and physics are invited 
to apply to spend 10 weeks in the San Francisco Bay area working on a 
scientific research project in the field of astrobiology or planetary 
science. Students receive a stipend, travel, and living expenses. 
Applications are due by February 1, 2012.

NASA POSTDOCTORAL FELLOWSHIPS

The NASA Postdoctoral Program (NPP) offers scientists and engineers 
unique opportunities to conduct research at NASA Centers. Each NPP 
fellowship opportunity is designed to advance NASA research in a 
specific project related to space science, earth science, aeronautics, 
space operations, exploration systems, lunar science, or astrobiology. 

Applicants must have a Ph.D. or equivalent degree in hand before 
beginning the fellowship, but may apply while completing the degree 
requirements. U. S. citizens, Lawful Permanent Residents, and foreign 
nationals eligible for J-1 status as a Research Scholar may apply. 
An H-1B Visa status is not acceptable because the NPP is not an 
employment program. 

Stipends for Postdoctoral Fellows start at $50,000 per year, with 
moderate supplements for high cost-of-living areas and for certain 
academic specialties. Funds are available for relocation expenses, 
up to a specified limit, and health insurance is available through 
the program. Fellows also receive $8,000 per appointment year to 
support travel to conferences, meetings, and other activities that 
directly support their research.

Applications are accepted three times each year: March 1, July 1, and 
November 1.

POSTDOCTORAL POSITION IN PLANETARY SCIENCE

The planetary sciences group in the Department of Earth and Ocean 
Sciences at the University of British Columbia, Vancouver invites 
applications for a postdoctoral position in planetary geophysics. 
Candidates should have a Ph.D in geophysics or planetary physics. Areas 
of particular interest are characterization and modeling of planetary 
magnetic fields, interior structure of the terrestrial planets, 
geophysical studies of Mercury using MESSENGER data, and impact
processes.

The initial appointment is for one year, but the appointment is 
renewable for an additional year. The position will be available 
beginning in May 2012 or as mutually acceptable. Review of applications
will begin in January 2012 and the position will remain open until 
filled.

Applicants should send (1) a current CV with a list of publications, 
(2) a list of names, addresses and e-mail addresses of at least 3 
references, and (3) a 1-2 page summary of current and proposed 
research to:

USGS ASTROGEOLOGY ANNOUNCEMENT TO HIRE A NEW SCIENCE CENTER DIRECTOR

The incumbent serves as Director of the Astrogeology Science Center
(ASTRO) in the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), and manages and directs 
all scientific activities therein.  The USGS ASTRO Science Center 
conducts the major segment of the USGS's program of scientific 
research into the geologic nature and history of the planets and 
satellites in the Solar System.  The program encompasses a variety of 
scientific and technical disciplines including geology, geophysics, 
computer science, cartography, geodesy, space science, physical 
science, and remote sensing. This interdisciplinary position may be 
classified in any of the following professional occupational series; 
General Physical Science GS-1301; Geophysics, GS-1313; Chemistry, 
GS-1320; Geology, GS-1350.  Astronomers and astrophysicists will 
typically apply under General Physical Science (GS-1301).

This opportunity closes 27 Jan 2012.

SPECIAL LPSC SESSION -- A SEASON IN THE SATURN SYSTEM: NEW DISCOVERIES 
AND SEASONAL CHANGES

LPSC abstracts are due January 10 (5P CST).

http://www.lpi.usra.edu/meetings/lpsc2012/

Please consider submitting an abstract for the following special 
session:

A Season in the Saturn System:  New Discoveries and Seasonal Changes

Titan and the icy satellites of Saturn have been under careful 
observation by the Cassini spacecraft for seven years, from southern 
summer into northern spring. Observations have yielded detections of 
change in surfaces, plumes, clouds and lakes, as well as important 
snapshots in time data on moons such as Dione and Rhea. This special 
session will include presentations concerning new results in the Saturn 
system, and observations, modeling, and predictions of active processes 
on the surfaces of satellites in light of seasonal change.

Happy New Year,
Amanda Hendrix, Dennis Matson, Jani Radebaugh, Bob Nelson, Karl 
Mitchell (special session co-organizers)

INTERNATIONAL WORKSHOP PLANNING -- MARS AND THE MOON: CHANGING 
PERSPECTIVES AND NEW QUESTIONS

Dear Mars Scientists,

I am working with colleagues in China and Europe to organize a workshop 
on scientific studies of Mars and the Moon.  The tentative details are:

International Workshop on Mars and the Moon: Changing Perspectives and 
New Questions
Beijing, China
August 6-10, 2012

The workshop will include scientists from the US, Europe, and China 
and will encompass all aspects of Mars and Moon science from geophysics
and geology to aeronomy and solar wind interactions.  The workshop is 
one week before the AOGS meeting (Singapore) and 2 weeks before the IAU 
general assembly (Beijing).  The US, Europe, and China are all 
conducting or planning spacecraft missions to Mars.  This workshop will
concentrate on the science questions that motivate the missions and the 
data returned from the missions, rather than details of spacecraft
investigations.  The main body organizing the workshop is the Chinese 
Academy of Sciences.  It would help their planning to have an estimate 
of US scientists likely to attend.  If you are interested and think
that you might attend, please send me an email indicating your 
attendance likeliness: highly likely or possible.  

Best Regards,
Roger Yelle
