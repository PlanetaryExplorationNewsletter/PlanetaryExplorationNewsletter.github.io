NEW "DISCOVERIES IN PLANETARY SCIENCE" CLASSROOM POWERPOINTS 
AVAILABLE IN ENGLISH, SPANISH, AND FARSI

The DPS Education Subcommittee announces the 6th release of 
"Discoveries in Planetary Science" Classroom Powerpoints, covering 
three new topics:

- Mercury Hollows
- Man in the Moon
- The Size of Eris

These are succinct summaries of discoveries too recent to appear in 
"Intro Astronomy" college textbooks; each set consists of just three 
slides to be shown: the discovery itself, a basic explanation based on 
good planetary science, and the "big picture" context. Another page for 
further information is provided as well. Powerpoints and PDFs can be 
downloaded from: 

http://dps.aas.org/education/dpsdisc

By popular request, all available slide sets have now been translated 
into both Spanish and Farsi. Versions in other languages should become 
available in the coming months. Planetary scientists with recent or 
upcoming results of broad interest are encouraged to submit them for 
consideration by providing an initial draft using the template provided 
on the website. For more information, contact Nick Schneider & Dave 
Brain at dpsdisc@aas.org.

EGU 2013 PLANETARY GEODYNAMICS SESSION 

Vienna, Austria 7-12 April 2013, GD1.1/PS9.3/TS1.4

The PLANETARY GEODYNAMICS session (co-sponsored by AGU-SEDI) invites 
contributions that evaluate geodynamic processes from a comparative 
perspective, using either the Earth or other planetary bodies as 
guide. We seek to understand the interaction of mantle dynamics and 
lithospheric processes, and their resulting surface expression, under 
a range of different (plate) tectonic and mantle regimes. We welcome 
studies on all aspect of comparative planetology, such as, for example, 
analys of satellite potential field or remote sensing data, numerical 
modelling, and analytical studies that will give us a better 
understanding of the physics and/or thermal, mechanical and rheological 
properties of our Earth as well as other planets or exoplanets.

The final deadline for abstracts is January 9, 2013.
Student support application deadline is November 30, 2012:

NASA POSTDOCTORAL FELLOWSHIPS

The NASA Postdoctoral Program (NPP) offers scientists and engineers 
unique opportunities to conduct research at NASA Centers. Each NPP 
fellowship opportunity is designed to advance NASA research in a 
specific project related to space science, earth science, aeronautics, 
exploration systems, lunar science, astrobiology, or astrophysics.

Applicants must have a Ph.D. or equivalent degree in hand before 
beginning the fellowship, but may apply while completing the degree 
requirements. U.S. citizens, Lawful Permanent Residents, and foreign 
nationals eligible for J-1 status as a Research Scholar may apply.

Stipends start at $53,500 per year, with supplements for high 
cost-of-living areas and for certain academic specialties. Financial 
assistance is available for relocation and health insurance, and 
$8,000 per year is provided for professional travel.

Applications are accepted three times each year: March 1, July 1, and 
November 1.

EXTRATERRESTRIAL VOLCANISM AND TECTONICS SESSION AT EGU 2013

Vienna, Austria - 7-12 April 2013

We invite contributions to our session "Extraterrestrial volcanism and 
tectonics - from geological mapping and chronostratigraphy to 
experiment/modelling and analogue studies". This session aims to 
compile all facets of volcanic and tectonic processes across the solar 
system. Comparative studies on active volcanic/tectonic systems on 
Earth are particularly welcome. A detailed session description is 
given at: 

http://meetingorganizer.copernicus.org/EGU2013/session/12422

Abstract submission deadline is Wednesday, January 9. Please note that 
support applications need to be submitted by Friday, November 30.

We hope our session provides once again a forum for a broad range of 
discussions in the fields of Earth and Planetary Sciences.

Best regards,
Thomas Platz, Matteo Massironi, Paul Byrne, Pascal Allemand & Harald 
Hiesinger
