PASSING OF JOHN GUEST (1938-2012)

John Guest (1938-2012) was a pioneer in planetary geologic mapping, 
contributing to the first geologic map of Mercury and the first 
comprehensive map of the eastern equatorial region of Mars with Ron 
Greeley. He participated in the Mariner 10, Viking and Magellan 
missions. Along with Ron, he helped to select the Viking 2 landing 
site. Primarily John was a volcanologist, happiest when he was in the 
field, especially at Mt. Etna. He founded the NASA Regional Planetary 
Image Facility at University College London, and taught many students 
there. His work on Mars, Mercury, the Moon and Venus, as well as his 
very extensive work on terrestrial volcanology, leave a rich legacy. 
He had a particular talent for being able to interpret geology from
surface morphology - whether in the field, from aerial photographs or 
planetary images. He was much loved by his collaborators and students 
for his kind and generous spirit, and his sense of humor. In 1991, he 
was awarded the GSA G.K. Gilbert award and the asteroid 1982 HL was 
named Guest by the IAU. He is survived by his wife Mary and sons 
James and Ben.

GSA SESSION - NEW MOON RISING: THE LATEST GEOLOGIC RESULTS FROM THE 
LUNAR SURFACE

Dear colleagues,

Scott Mest, Noah Petro and I are convening a session at the GSA Annual 
Meeting in Charlotte in November on advances in lunar surface geology, 
entitled "New Moon Rising: The Latest Geologic Results from the Lunar 
Surface."

The Moon continues to be a prime target for remote exploration and 
analysis. With the results of the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter rolling 
in fast and furious, and data from Kaguya and Chadrayaan-1 being 
analyzed, the time is right for a focused session at GSA on lunar 
surface science. The session will review the current state of lunar 
surface science - geology, geomorphology, mineralogy - as it is 
rapidly evolving due to the acquisition and analysis of exciting new
datasets.  

Because recent missions have acquired a broad range of datasets, we 
invite abstracts focusing on a wide range of topics covering the most 
recent developments regarding our understanding of the geologic 
processes of the Moon as they are manifested on the surface, including
abstracts on the Moon's overall stratigraphy and geologic history, 
surface geochemistry and mineralogy.

http://www.geosociety.org/meetings/2012/sessions/topical.asp

Abstracts on any aspect of lunar surface geology are welcome.

Due date: August 14, 2012

GSA SESSION - GEOCHEMISTRY, MINERALOGY AND PETROLOGY OF MARS

Session T148.

This session will focus on advances made in understanding the 
formation, evolution, and alteration of the martian crust through 
geochemical and mineralogical analyses. Presentations that utilize 
spacecraft data analysis, experiments, models, and/or analog studies 
are welcome.

NASA POSTDOCTORAL FELLOWSHIPS

The NASA Postdoctoral Program (NPP) offers scientists and engineers 
unique opportunities to conduct research at NASA Centers. Each NPP 
fellowship opportunity is designed to advance NASA research in a 
specific project related to space science, earth science, aeronautics, 
exploration systems, lunar science, astrobiology, or astrophysics.

Applicants must have a Ph.D. or equivalent degree in hand before 
beginning the fellowship, but may apply while completing the degree 
requirements. U. S. citizens, Lawful Permanent Residents, and foreign 
nationals eligible for J-1 status as a Research Scholar may apply.

Stipends start at $50,000 per year, with supplements for high 
cost-of-living areas and for certain academic specialties. Financial 
assistance is available for relocation and health insurance, and 
$8,000 per year is provided for professional travel.

Applications are accepted three times each year: March 1, July 1, and 
November 1.

FINAL ANNOUNCEMENT, PLANETARY DATA: A WORKSHOP FOR USERS & SOFTWARE 
DEVELOPERS

Final Call for Registration
Planetary Data:  A Workshop for Users and Software Developers
du Bois Conference Center, Northern Arizona University
Flagstaff, Arizona (USA), June 25-29, 2012

Registration Deadline (if not submitting abstract): June 15
Data Users Workshop: June 25-27 
Software Developers Workshop: June 27-29

Agenda now available at:

http://astrogeology.usgs.gov/groups/Planetary-Data-Workshop
 
The two content tracks will share a common day on Wednesday to hold 
talks of overlapping interest. One or both tracks can be attended 
and there is no registration fee for either. 
 
Planetary Data Users Track
*  Share information on digital planetary data, including 
availability, access and analysis methods.
*  Present how-to guides for locating, acquiring, processing, and 
working with digital planetary data.
 
Planetary Software Developers Track
*  Bring researchers and technology experts together to discuss and 
exchange ideas to identify difficult planetary research issues that 
can be addressed by software development.
*  Present planetary data processing and software development 
methods and techniques.

If you cannot attend, we would like to invite you to share your 
thoughts on needed software technologies for the planetary community 
(5-10 min survey):

[NASA] SCIENCE OBJECTIVES AND REQUIREMENTS FOR THE NEXT NASA UV/VISIBLE 
MISSION CONCEPTS REQUEST FOR INFORMATION NNH12ZDA008L

Solicitation Number: NNH12ZDA008L
Release Date: May 25, 2012
Response Date: August 10, 2012
 
NASA's Science Mission Directorate (SMD), through the Astrophysics 
Division, solicits information pertaining to potential ultraviolet (UV)
and visible wavelength astrophysics science investigations.  
Specifically, NASA seeks information that can be used to develop a 
cohesive set of science goals that motivate and support the 
development of the next generation of UV/Visible space astrophysics
missions.  Information may include broad science goals, justifications 
for investigations that support Cosmic Origins (COR) Program science 
goals (for examples, visit http://cor.gsfc.nasa.gov/), specific 
measurements or proxy observing plans for well-defined astrophysical 
experiments, or any aspect of scientific inquiry in the UV/Visible 
that supports the above COR goals.
