NRC'S COMMITTEE ON ASTROBIOLOGY AND PLANETARY SCIENCE

The National Research Council's Space Studies Board has merged the 
Committee on Planetary and Lunar Exploration (COMPLEX) and the 
Committee on the Origins and Evolution of Life (COEL) to create the 
new Committee on Astrobiology and Planetary Sciences (CAPS). The prime 
functions of CAPS will be to monitor the implementation of the 
recommendations contained in the Vision and Voyages planetary science 
decadal survey and in the reports drafted under the aegis of COEL and 
COMPLEX, and  to act as the organizing committee for future studies in 
the areas of astrobiology and planetary science (e.g., the mid-term 
assessment of  the decadal survey). Philip Christensen (Arizona State 
University) and J. Gregory Ferry (Pennsylvania State University) have 
agreed to serve as the co-chairs of CAPS. Seventeen additional 
individuals have been identified and have agreed to serve on the 
committee,  pending approval by the NRC's Executive Office. CAPS will 
hold its first face-to-face meeting on 23-25 May in the National 
Academies' Keck Center, 500 Fifth St. NW, Washington, D.C., 20001.  
Additional details about CAPS will be posted on its website at:

[NASA] CHANGE TO CDAPS PROPOSAL SUBMISSION PROCESS

We wanted to draw your attention to a change in the way that proposals 
to NASA's Cassini Data Analysis and Participating Scientist program 
(CDAPS) will be submitted this year. We will be testing out a new 
two-step proposal submission process for this program. This means that 
a Step-1 proposal (a glorified notice of intent) is required to later 
submit a normal (i.e., full, 15-page) proposal, which is now called 
the Step-2 proposal. The Step-1 proposals are due March 23, 2012. The 
full Step-2 proposals are due May 4, 2012.

For more details please see the 2012 CDAPS Call for Proposals at:

NASA POSTDOCTORAL FELLOWSHIPS

The NASA Postdoctoral Program (NPP) offers scientists and engineers 
unique opportunities to conduct research at NASA Centers. Each NPP 
fellowship opportunity is designed to advance NASA research in a 
specific project related to space science, earth science, aeronautics, 
exploration systems, lunar science, astrobiology, or astrophysics.

Applicants must have a Ph.D. or equivalent degree in hand before 
beginning the fellowship, but may apply while completing the degree 
requirements. U. S. citizens, Lawful Permanent Residents, and foreign 
nationals eligible for J-1 status as a Research Scholar may apply.

Stipends start at $50,000 per year, with supplements for high 
cost-of-living areas and for certain academic specialties. Financial 
assistance is available for relocation and health insurance, and 
$8,000 per year is provided for professional travel.

Applications are accepted three times each year: March 1, July 1, and 
November 1.

[NASA] PDS RELEASES STARDUST-NEXT MISSION DATA

The NASA Planetary Data System is pleased to announce release of the
Stardust-NExT mission data acquired during the comet 9P/Tempel 1 flyby 
in February 2011. The delivery includes raw and calibrated images from 
the Navigation Camera (NavCam). Certified (although in lien resolution) 
data from Dust Flux Monitor Instrument (DFMI) are also available.

The data can be accessed through the PDS Small Bodies Node. To see and

[NASA] PLANETARY SCIENCE SUMMER SCHOOL APPLICATIONS

NASA is accepting applications from science and engineering post-docs,
recent PhDs, and doctoral students for its 24th  Annual Planetary 
Science Summer School, which will hold two separate sessions this 
summer (18-22 June and 16-20 July) at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in 
Pasadena, Calif. During the program and pre-session webinars, student 
teams will carry out the equivalent of an early mission concept study, 
prepare a proposal authorization review presentation, present it to a 
review board, and receive feedback. By the end of the session, students 
will have a clearer understanding of the life cycle of a space mission; 
relationships between mission design, cost, and schedule; and the 
tradeoffs necessary to stay within cost and schedule while preserving 
the quality of science. Applications are due March 28, 2012. Partial 
financial support is available for a limited number of individuals.

[NASA] PDS MESSENGER RELEASE 7

The Planetary Data System is pleased to announce Release 7 of data
collected by the MErcury Surface, Space ENvironment, GEochemistry, and
Ranging (MESSENGER) mission. After a 6.6-year cruise phase, during 
which the spacecraft flew by Earth once, Venus twice, and Mercury three 
times, MESSENGER entered orbit about the innermost planet on 18 March 
2011, becoming the first spacecraft ever to do so, and initiating a 
one-year phase of orbital operations.  NASA recently extended 
MESSENGER's orbital operations for a second year.

This delivery includes formatted raw and calibrated data for all seven
MESSENGER science instruments and the radio science investigation for
months three through six of orbital operations (18 May 2011 through 17
September 2011).  SPICE data from launch through the period of this
release are also included. With this release, data are now available to
the public for the first full Mercury solar day of MESSENGER orbital
operations.

All data sets in this MESSENGER release can be accessed from:

http://pds.nasa.gov/subscription_service/SS-20120308.html

[NASA] DUE DATES CHANGED FOR THE PLANETARY PROTECTION RESEARCH PROGRAM

Planetary protection involves preventing biological contamination on 
both outbound and sample return missions to other planetary bodies. 
Numerous areas of research in astrobiology/exobiology are improving 
our understanding of the potential for survival of Earth microbes in 
extraterrestrial environments, relevant to preventing contamination of 
other bodies by organisms carried on spacecraft. Research is required 
to improve NASA's understanding of the potential for both forward and 
backward contamination, how to minimize it, and to set standards in 
these areas for spacecraft preparation and operating procedures. 
Improvements in technologies and methods for evaluating the potential 
for life in returned samples are also of interest.

Notices of Intent are now due on June 29, 2012. 

Proposals are now due September 5, 2012. 

This change is being made so that the due dates occur on work days.

[NASA] INTERESTED IN SERVING ON A REVIEW PANEL?

Postdocs and early-career professionals, would you like to get some 
experience on a review panel?  Serving on a review panel is one of the 
best ways to improve your proposal-writing skills.  We are recruiting 
reviewers for the NESSF (NASA Earth and Space Science Fellowship) 
program. These are graduate student fellowship proposals that cover a 
wide range of planetary topics. The review panels will be held 
virtually via Webex (no travel required) in mid to late April. If you 
are interested in serving on this panel, please send a CV or short 
description of your expertise to

FIRST ANNOUNCEMENT - LUNGRADCON 2012

Registration is now open for the 3nd Annual Lunar Graduate Conference
(LunGradCon 2012) to be held on Saturday and Sunday, July 14-15, 2012
at the NASA Ames Research Center (ARC), preceding the NASA Lunar
Science Forum. LunGradCon provides an opportunity for grad students
and early-career postdocs to present their research on lunar science
in a low-stress, friendly environment, being critiqued only by their
peers. In addition to oral presentations, the conference presents
opportunities for professional development and networking with fellow
grad students and postdocs, as well as senior members of the NASA
Lunar Science Institute. A limited amount of funding will be provided
for travel and lodging costs.
