[NASA] PLANETARY SCIENCE DIVISION SEEKS VOLUNTEER REVIEWERS

The Planetary Science Division is currently seeking volunteer reviewers 
for the evaluation of proposals to the Outer Planets Research (OPR) 
and Maturation of Instruments for Solar System Exploration (MatISSE) 
ROSES Programs. A web form for volunteers can be found at: 

http://science.nasa.gov/researchers/volunteer-review-panels/ 

where volunteers can indicate their interest and areas of expertise.

POSTDOCTORAL FELLOWSHIPS AT ASU-SESE

The School of Earth and Space Exploration (SESE) at Arizona State 
University invites applications for the Exploration Postdoctoral 
Fellowship Program. This program provides opportunities for 
postdoctoral research with an emphasis on inter-disciplinary 
collaboration. Research areas within SESE encompass theoretical and 
observational astronomy, cosmology, astrobiology, earth sciences, 
climate science, planetary sciences, exploration systems engineering, 
astronomical instrumentation and science education.

Applications must include a research proposal that has been discussed 
with two prospective faculty mentors at ASU. Potential research topics 
span the full range of research interests of our faculty: 

http://sese.asu.edu/focus_areas 

When a topic of mutual interest is identified, the applicant will 
prepare and submit a 5-8 page research proposal.

A full description of the application process is found at: 

http://sese.asu.edu/opportunities 

Applications are due by December 31, 2012 and three reference letters 
by January 7, 2013 via email to exppd@asu.edu. This 2-year appointment 
will start between July and September 2013 with full benefits,  being 
renewable for a 3rd year contingent on performance and funding. The 
applicant must have finished all requirements for a PhD degree before 
starting this position.

ASU is an equal opportunity/affirmative action employer that actively 
seeks diversity among applicants and promotes a diverse workforce.

LUNAR VOLATILES FOCUS GROUP

The Lunar Volatiles Focus Group will begin having monthly, ~1 hour
teleconference discussions in November. Themes will span topics of
interest regarding lunar volatiles. They include volatiles in, on, 
and of the Moon; their detection, sources, distribution, and 
utilization; and related modeling, lab work, comparative planetology, 
data analysis, instrumentation, and engineering. We will also begin 
planning a Workshop Without Walls to be held in early 2013.

We invite all who are interested to participate. If you are interested 
in participating, please take the following two actions:

1) Subscribe to the "Friends of Lunar Volatiles" e-mail list that
Georgiana Kramer has set up for meeting notifications and email
discussions:

https://lists.hou.usra.edu/mailman/listinfo/folv

2)  Sign up on the Doodle poll with your availability on a typical week
(ignore the dates, use the days of the week) to help select the time 
for the monthly telecon that maximizes participant availability:
