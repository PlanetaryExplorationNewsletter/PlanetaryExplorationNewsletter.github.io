EDITORIAL

Mark V. Sykes
Planetary Science Institute

The US planetary science community is a national resource that is 
essential to our solar system exploration program. This community was 
created by and is sustained through NASA support, a significant 
fraction of which is the planetary R&A programs. An analysis of updated 
budget information posted at http://planetarypolicy.org shows that 
funding for annually competed research and data analysis programs in 
ROSES (less than 13% of the planetary budget) in recent years is:

FY11 $151M
FY12 $161M
FY13 $153M

At a minimum, this year's decline needs to be reversed to ensure that 
selection rates are improved to stop the imminent loss of the younger 
generation of planetary scientists as well as many seasoned 
researchers. The cost is frankly small and demands high priority. 

Multi-year budget planning is essential.

We also face significant negative consequences from the effective 
collapse of the Discovery program combined with the termination of the 
Mars Scount program. Discovery (now including Mars) needs to be 
restored to its original AO cadence and selection rates. With the 
absence of Administration leadership, this will require action by the 
community to call for additional appropriated funds with explicit 
direction by Congress.

[Editor Note: This Editorial was modified on 12/31/12, to correct an 
error, reducing the FY11 budget from $159M to $151M, and include 
changes in the text to reflect this.]

[NASA] CHANGES IN THE MANAGEMENT OF THE MARS EXPLORATION PROGRAM

James L. Green, Director, NASA Planetary Science Division

With the retirement of Doug McCuistion, Director of the Mars 
Exploration Program (MEP) at the end of December, I would like to 
announce the following:

Acting MEP Director: James Green
Lead MEP Program Executive: Lisa May
Lead MEP Program Scientist: Michael Meyer

Doug has worked tirelessly for the Federal Government for over 30 years 
and as the Director of MEP for 8 1/2 years. His dedication to the 
program is legendary. As a good friend, I will miss our daily 
interactions and his very steady hand on the Mars program. I am sure I 
speak for everyone in wishing him the very best in his future 
endeavors.

[NASA] LORI GLAZE NEW VEXAG CHAIR

Dr. Lori Glaze a planetary volcanologist from NASA GSFC has been 
appointed as the next Venus Exploration Analysis Group (VEXAG) chair 
effective January 1, 2013. She succeeds Dr. Sanjay Limaye, the current
VEXAG chair, from Wisconsin University-Madison. The Planetary Science 
Division thanks Dr. Limaye for his leadership and support to further 
the aims of Venus exploration, and welcomes Dr. Glaze as the VEXAG 
chair.

WOULD YOU LIKE TO SEE A VOLCANOLOGY SESSION AT LPSC 2013?

We were denied a special session, but are hoping for an informal 
session focused on planetary volcanology at the next LPSC. Towards that 
end, we encourage the submission of abstracts focusing on planetary 
volcanology, especially the topics of lava emplacement and resultant 
geomorphology. Please help us achieve critical mass so that this topic 
will warrant an informal oral/poster session.

Thank you,

Serina Diniega & Suzanne Smrekar (JPL)
