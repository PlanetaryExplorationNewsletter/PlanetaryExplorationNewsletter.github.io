MEX LUNAR LIST SOLICITATION FOR PAYLOADS

Moon Express Inc. is a Google Lunar X PRIZE Team based at NASA-Ames 
Research Park and partnered with NASA-Ames on lunar lander development.

Moon Express plans to fly a series of robotic commercial lunar landing 
missions. These missions will carry scientific, educational, and 
commercial payloads to the lunar surface, beginning in late 2013 with 
Moon Express-1 (ME-1). Moon Express is also now soliciting payloads for 
ME-2, to fly in 2014/2015.

Several payloads are already under agreement to fly on ME-1 but open 
payload space remains on ME-1, and ME-2 has not yet begun to fill.

Moon Express seeks to discuss payload flight opportunities with funded 
US or overseas PIs and organizations with research or educational 
payloads that can be ready for launch aboard ME-1 in late 2013, as well 
as PIs/organizations interested in proposing to NASA, NSF, or other 
agencies/sources for the ME-2 launch in 2014/2015.

Interested PIs and organizations should contact Moon Express Chief 
Scientist Dr. Alan Stern (alanstern@moonexpress.com; 303.324.5269).

DAP-2012

The Dust, Atmosphere and Plasma Environment of the Moon and Small 
Bodies (DAP-2012) workshop will take place June 6-8, 2012, in Boulder, 
Colorado.  It will be a forum to discuss our current understanding of 
the surface environment of the Moon and asteroids, to share new results 
from past and ongoing missions, and to describe expectations for 
planned upcoming missions. The workshop will be focused on the open 
science questions, the status and future of our modeling and laboratory 
experimental capabilities, the definition of the required measurements 
and instrument capabilities for future investigations from orbit, or 
to be deployed on the surface. 

Contributions to DAP-2012 are planned to be published in a special 
issue of Planetary and Space Sciences.

The workshop is hosted by A. Stern and M. Horanyi, and supported 
by the NASA Lunar Science Institute: Colorado Center for Lunar Dust 
and Atmospheric Studies, the Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space 
Physics, and the Center for Integrated Plasma Studies of the 
University of Colorado.

PELLAS-RYDER BEST STUDENT PAPER AWARD NOMINATIONS DUE

Just a reminder that nominations for the Pellas-Ryder Best Student 
Paper Award are due next Tuesday, January 31, 2012.  Please send your
nomination to P-R Nominations Committee Chair David Williams 
(David.Williams@asu.edu).

The Pellas-Ryder Best Student Paper Award, jointly sponsored by MetSoc 
and the GSA Planetary Geology Division, is awarded to a student who is 
first author of the best planetary science paper published in a 
peer-reviewed scientific journal. Any first author of a paper 
published on a topic listed on the cover of Meteoritics & Planetary 
Science is eligible for consideration for this award.

The award is limited to undergraduate and graduate students who are
first authors of a paper published in peer-reviewed scientific
journals between January 1 - December 31, 2011.  For full details on
eligibility, go to this website:

AVAILABILITY OF HAYABUSA MISSION SAMPLES / NEW COSMIC DUST CATALOG

(1) Hayabusa Mission Samples

Today JAXA and NASA announce the general availability of samples of 
asteroid Itokawa returned to Earth by the Hayabusa Mission. While the 
bulk of the samples are available from JAXA, by agreement 10% of the 
Itokawa samples are available from NASA.  Please see the announcement 
of opportunity letter from JAXA,  their sample catalog, and directions 
for preparing sample requests at:

http://hayabusaao.isas.jaxa.jp/

The NASA website for their share of the Itokawa samples is at:

VOLCANO-ICE INTERACTIONS ON EARTH AND OTHER PLANETS CONFERENCE III

Abstract deadline:  15 February 2012
Conference date:  18-22 June 2012
Fairbanks, AK

http://volcanoes.dickinson.edu/iavcei_iacs_viic/events2012.html#june

The joint IAVCEI-IACS Commission on Volcano-Ice Interactions would 
like to announce the Third International Conference on Volcano-Ice
Interactions on Earth & Other Planets, to be held in Anchorage, 
Alaska, June 18-22, 2012. We are planning a three-day oral and poster 
session meeting format followed by two days for field excursions to 
the Wrangell volcanic field and Cook Inlet volcanoes. The conference 
precedes the International Glaciological Society symposium on 
mountain glaciers, ice caps and ice sheets in a warming climate that 
will be held in Fairbanks the following week from June 25-29. The 
purpose of the conference is to bring together scientists with a 
common interest in volcano-ice interactions and to highlight recent 
studies and eruptions at snow- and ice-clad volcanoes. We are 
particularly interested in encouraging students and post-docs to 
attend and present their research results.

NASA LUNAR SCIENCE FORUM DIRECTOR'S SEMINAR

NLSI's new Director's Seminar will be the last Tuesday of every month.  

January 31, 2012, 9:00AM PST, 17:00 GMT

Excavation and Mobility Modeling of Lunar Regolith as Part of the NLSI 
"Scientific Exploration Potential of the Lunar Poles" Project

Speaker: Jerome B. Johnson, PhD, University of Alaska, Fairbanks. 

Webinar abstract:

The "Excavation and Mobility Modeling" task of the "Scientific 
Exploration Potential of the Lunar Poles" project is to develop 
physically based discrete element method (DEM) models of the 
interaction of wheeled mobility platforms and excavation tools with 
lunar regolith at the poles and elsewhere. The DEM explicitly models 
the dynamics of assemblies of particles, such as regolith (the layer 
of loose rock particles covering bedrock). The goal is to develop a 
DEM modeling capability that is usable by non-specialists and that can 
be configured to accurately simulate a wide range of applied and basic 
science and engineering problems beyond the current focus on mobility 
and excavation problems. 

Participation Instructions:
         
RSVP to Ricky Guest (Ricky.Guest@nasa.gov) if joining by Polycom or

activities (e.g., development of science experiment hardware). The 
funds available for awards in each program element offered in this 
ROSES NRA range from less than one to several million dollars, which 
allow selection from a few to as many as several dozen proposals
