SPECIAL: INPUT REQUESTED ON IMPACT OF DELAYS IN SELECTION AND FUNDING 
OF RESEARCH AND DATA ANALYSIS PROGRAM AWARDS

Program officers of a number of planetary research and data analysis 
programs this past year have had to contend with long delays in being
allocated budgets, which have resulted in delays for selections (in 
at least one case more than 300 days!) and delays in scientists getting
their funds. This has caused serious problems for scientists who have 
had to worry about whether to make hires, make purchases, or even 
whether they have sufficient funds to cover their own salaries. This 
was apparent by statements made at the NASA R&A Lunch at LPSC last 
Monday.

Over this week, I would like to gather information about how these 
delays have impacted members of our community and how it impacts our
science. These will be posted minus personal information at a link 
in the next PEN. Your input will be of great value in making the case 
that stability of these programs needs to be a priority of PSD 
management (as has been recognized by several past NRC reports). 

Please send your input on this to

Thank you.

NASA PRESENTATIONS AT LPSC POSTED

Charts presented at the R&A Lunch at LPSC by Jonathan Rall have been 
posted at:

http://www.lpi.usra.edu/meetings/lpsc2012/archive/

This includes a breakdown of the 2010, 2011 and 2012 budgets for all 
of the research and data analysis programs. 

This page also includes the charts presented at NASA Night by John 
Grunsfeld and Jim Green.

SURVEY OF PLANETARY WORKFORCE

The results of an extensive survey of the planetary workforce is
now available at:

http://lasp.colorado.edu/mop/resources/links/
PlanetaryScienceWorkForceSurvey2011/

Part A: A survey of academic departments that include planetary 
science was published last year.

We now have completed
Part B: A survey to individual members of the AAS/DPS, the AGU 
Planetary Science Section, the Meteoritical Society as well as 
attendees of the LPSC will be distributed summer 2011. This survey 
is aimed at professional planetary scientists (with a PhD) working 
in the US.You can download a 2-page summary and full report of the 
survey.

NASA POSTDOCTORAL FELLOWSHIPS

The NASA Postdoctoral Program (NPP) offers scientists and engineers 
unique opportunities to conduct research at NASA Centers. Each NPP 
fellowship opportunity is designed to advance NASA research in a 
specific project related to space science, earth science, aeronautics,
exploration systems, lunar science, astrobiology, or astrophysics.

Applicants must have a Ph.D. or equivalent degree in hand before 
beginning the fellowship, but may apply while completing the degree 
requirements. U. S. citizens, Lawful Permanent Residents, and foreign 
nationals eligible for J-1 status as a Research Scholar may apply.

Stipends start at $50,000 per year, with supplements for high 
cost-of-living areas and for certain academic specialties. Financial
assistance is available for relocation and health insurance, and 
$8,000 per year is provided for professional travel.

Applications are accepted three times each year: March 1, July 1, 
and November 1.

ELSEVIER AWARD ON RADIATIVE TRANSFER

We would like to bring to your attention a recent inaugural Elsevier
Award on Radiative Transfer, open to all scientists who had sizeable
impact on the advancement of Radiative Transfer. The Poynting Award on
Radiative Transfer will be administered by JQSRT and its details are
announced at the JQSRT web site:

http://www.journals.elsevier.com/journal-of-quantitative-spectroscopy-
and-radiative-transfer/news/poynting-award-on-radiative-transfer-call-
for-nominations/

Please send all nomination packages no later than April 30, 2012 to 
M. Pinar Menguc, one of the three Editor-in-Chief of JQSRT
(pinar.menguc@ozyegin.edu.tr).

NEW TOPOGRAPHY FOR VENUS NOW AVAILABLE

Left-left stereo SAR images from the Magellan mission have been
processed by a team at the University of Alaska Fairbanks to generate
stereo-derived topography for Venus.  These data have a horizontal
resolution of 1-2 km, roughly an order of magnitude improvement over 
the gridded altimetry data from Magellan.  The stereo-derived 
topography cover ~20% of the planet, including significant portions of 
Maxwell Montes, Tellus Regio, and Aphrodite Terra.  This effectively 
represents a new data set for Venus, a planet that has not seen a NASA 
mission in over two decades.  The data and more information are 
available at:

http://www.gi.alaska.edu/~rherrick/stereotopo.html

Questions regarding the data can be sent to Robert Herrick at 
rherrick@gi.alaska.edu
