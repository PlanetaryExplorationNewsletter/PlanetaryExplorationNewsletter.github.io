NEW HORIZONS STAMP PETITION

As a part of its EPO program, the New Horizons mission to the Pluto 
system is proposing a stamp commemorating its exploration of Pluto to
the US Postal Service.

The post office requires that stamp proposals be accompanied by a 
petition signed by members of the public who support the stamp 
proposal.  On Feb 1, the New Horizons team debuted their stamp 
petition at:

http://www.change.org/petitions/usps-honor-new-horizons-and-the-
exploration-of-pluto-with-a-usps-stamp#USA%20#NASA

Members of the PEN community are invited to sign on this petition 
with the public. Like the public, planetary scientists are also 
urged to tell their friends and colleagues via email, Facebook, 
Twitter, and other social media, and ask them to sign on as well.

The Data Users Track will provide a forum for discussion of available
planetary data, including how these data are located, downloaded, 
processed, and used for cartography and scientific data analysis. 
Topics may include: basic data search and retrieval tools (e.g., the 
Planetary Image Atlas, the Orbital Data Explorers, the Analysts 
Notebook, PILOT, etc.) for data from current planetary missions, 
summary of data processing and visualization tools (e.g., ISIS, 
JMARS/JMOON, Google Mars/Moon, ArcMap, etc.), and an introduction 
to PDS4 for users and data providers.

The Software Developers Track will bring researchers and technology
experts together to discuss and exchange ideas to identify difficult
planetary research issues that can be addressed by software 
development, and will present planetary data processing and software 
development methods and techniques.

WORKSHOP ANNOUNCEMENT: MOVING FORWARD IN SPACE

To be held in Philadelphia on June 4-6, 2012.

The primary goals of the workshop are to provide young female
scientists with information and skills development necessary for a
successful bid for a tenured professorship in the planetary sciences.
Workshop activities will focus on developing mentoring and networking
connections, techniques for more successful writing, acquiring grant
funding, sharing of classroom ideas and materials, maintaining
work-life balance, and challenges for dual career couples.

Invited participants include finishing doctoral students, postdocs,
scientists in a career break after a PhD or postdoc, in the early
stages of a tenure-track position or employed outside academia. Though
this conference is aimed specifically at maintaining female scientists
in the tenure-track pipeline, we encourage all underrepresented
minorities in the planetary sciences to apply. Dual career couples are
encouraged to apply as well.

Applications to attend available: March 7, 2012. 

E-mail: planetary@temple.edu for an application or additional 
information. We expect to invite 30-35 attendees to the workshop -  
and will have some funds available to help cover hotel costs for those
who request them (via a separate application).

Conference sponsor: National Science Foundation via
the FORWARD to Professorship Program.

NASA POSTDOCTORAL FELLOWSHIPS

The NASA Postdoctoral Program (NPP) offers scientists and engineers 
unique opportunities to conduct research at NASA Centers. Each NPP 
fellowship opportunity is designed to advance NASA research in a 
specific project related to space science, earth science, aeronautics,
space operations, exploration systems, lunar science, or astrobiology.

Applicants must have a Ph.D. or equivalent degree in hand before 
beginning the fellowship, but may apply while completing the degree
requirements. U. S. citizens, Lawful Permanent Residents, and foreign 
nationals eligible for J-1 status as a Research Scholar may apply.
 
Stipends for Postdoctoral Fellows start at $50,000 per year, with 
moderate supplements for high cost-of-living areas and for certain
academic specialties. Funds are available for relocation expenses, 
up to a specified limit, and health insurance is available through 
the program. Fellows also receive $8,000 per appointment year to 
support travel to conferences, meetings, and other activities that 
directly support their research.

Applications are accepted three times each year: March 1, July 1, 
and November 1.

FIRST LANDING SITE WORKSHOP FOR FUTURE MARS MISSIONS
       			   
Organized by the NASA-ESA collaboration 
February 29, 2012
Hilton Washington Dulles Airport hotel in Herndon, VA
Preceded by the second international meeting of MEPAG. 

Dear Colleagues:

The workshop will begin the identification and discussion of future 
possible landing sites for a rover mission to conduct in-situ 
science investigations including drilling and caching samples for 
possible return to Earth and subsequent analysis, within the 
constraints imposed by engineering requirements, planetary protection 
requirements, and the necessity of ensuring a safe landing. The goal 
is to gather information on candidate landing sites and develop a 
list of high priority candidates for future joint missions in a 
timely manner utilizing various orbiter instruments while they 
are still operating.  

The program for the workshop is now available at: 

http://marsnext.jpl.nasa.gov/

There is no registration fee for the workshop and all members of 
the scientific community are encouraged to participate in this 
important activity.  For those unable to travel to the workshop, it 
is expected that content will be made available via Webex. Further 
information on accessing Webex will be posted at: 

http://marsnext.jpl.nasa.gov/

Regards,
John Grant, Matt Golombek, and Nicolas Mangold, Co-Chairs, 
Mars Landing Site Steering Committee

DAWN DATA RELEASE: LEVEL 1A DATA FROM APPROACH AND SURVEY

The Dawn project has created a public website that is available to 
serve the cruise and Vesta data sets that have been delivered to the 
Planetary Data System (PDS) while the data are still under review. 
Data are available from all three Dawn instruments, the Framing Camera 
(FC), the Visual and Infrared Mapping Spectrometer (VIR), and the Gamma 
Ray and Neutron Detector (GRaND).  The data that are currently 
available are raw data, in engineering units, sometimes referred to 
as EDRs by the PDS or as NASA level-1a data. Additional data sets will 
be added when they are submitted to the PDS.

The Dawn website is located at:   

http://dawnpub.igpp.ucla.edu

Users of these data should exercise caution. Invariably there will be
errors or omissions in the documentation.  Please report any problems
that are encountered to:

Joseph Mafi (jmafi@igpp.ucla.edu - Dawn Science data archivist) or 
Steven Joy (sjoy@igpp.ucla.edu - Dawn Science Center manager)

and they will be added to the PDS peer review liens and corrected 
before final archive.

AAS OPPOSES THE GRANT ACT OF 2011 (H.R. 3433)

AAS endorsed a letter by the Coalition for National Science Funding on
30 January 2012, writing in opposition to the Grant Reform and New
Transparency (GRANT) Act of 2011 (H.R. 3433) because as written this
bill could have unintended adverse effects on the continued
development of the scientific and engineering research enterprise and
compromise the U.S. innovation system. Many other scientific
organization, such as the American Institute of Physics (AIP) and the
American Physical Society (APS), oppose the legislation as written.
For a link to the AAS endorsement see:

http://aas.org/policy/endorsements 

The text of the bill is posted at:

http://oversight.house.gov/images/stories/Markups/LANKFO_036_xml.pdf

Page 9, line 15 is where these requirements are outlined.

[Editor Note: This bill requires federal agencies to post online the 
full text of awarded grant proposals not later than three years after 
the grant is awarded, the full names and employers of the proposal
reviewers, and the reviews and scores.]
