[NASA] POSTDOCTORAL FELLOWSHIPS

The NASA Postdoctoral Program (NPP) offers scientists and engineers 
unique opportunities to conduct research at NASA Centers. Each NPP 
fellowship opportunity is designed to advance NASA research in a 
specific project related to space science, earth science, aeronautics, 
space operations, exploration systems, lunar science, or astrobiology.

Applicants must have a Ph.D. or equivalent degree in hand before 
beginning the fellowship, but may apply while completing the degree 
requirements. U. S. citizens, Lawful Permanent Residents, and foreign 
nationals eligible for J-1 status as a Research Scholar may apply.  
An H-1B Visa status is not acceptable because the NPP is not an 
employment program.

Stipends for Postdoctoral Fellows start at $50,000 per year, with 
moderate supplements for high cost-of-living areas and for certain 
academic specialties. Funds are available for relocation expenses, up 
to a specified limit, and health insurance is available through the 
program. Fellows also receive $8,000 per appointment year to support 
travel to conferences, meetings, and other activities that directly 
support their research.

Applications are accepted three times each year: March 1, July 1, 
and November 1.

PLANNING YOUR JWST SOLAR SYSTEM OBSERVATIONS (A DPS WORKSHOP)

The James Webb Space Telescope is an infrared-optimized space facility
scheduled for launch in 2018. Moving target (non-sidereal) tracking is 
a "Level 1" requirement for JWST, and has been implemented. At the 
DPS meeting in Reno NV, JWST team members will host a workshop 
specifically tailored for solar system observers. The workshop will 
start with an overview of the capabilities of the observatory and its 
science instruments. Workshop attendees will also learn about the 
representative science observing cases for solar system objects 
developed for the JWST Science Operations "Design Reference Mission."   
JWST team members will be available to answer your specific questions 
regarding special use cases for solar system requirements, in
particular observational issues and approaches. A white paper about 
JWST planetary observations Â­to be revised after this workshop - can 
be downloaded at:

As the DPS meeting draws closer, more details about the workshop will 
be provided at:

TITAN THROUGH TIME II WORKSHOP - ABSTRACT DEADLINE EXTENDED

The Second Workshop on "Titan Through Time: Formation, Evolution and
Fate" will be held at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center April 3-5th,
2012.

The deadline for abstracts has been extended to FEBRUARY 15th, due to
Cassini meetings being held this week. The deadline for registration
remains February 15th. Registration and abstract submission is through
the meeting website:

http://pirlwww.lpl.arizona.edu/~hurfordt/ttt/index.html

The 2 1/2 day program will consist of a mixture of invited reviews on
key Titan formation/evolution topics; contributed talks; and posters.
The oral program is filling rapidly - if you are requesting a talk
rather than poster we advise submitting your abstract as soon as
possible to receive full consideration.

We look forward to a very exciting and productive meeting in April on
Titan's past, present and future, and welcoming you then.

PLANETARY ORIGINS AND FRONTIERS OF EXPLORATION

May 27 - June 3, 2012
The Weizmann Institute of Science, Israel 

The theme was chosen to bring together experts in aspects of planetary 
formation, solar system evolution, and interpretation of exoplanetary 
discoveries. We plan to organize keynote talks around five topics:
 
Solar system formation
Gas giants formation and interiors
Moons and icy objects as keystones
Exoplanets
Extreme environments

The format is inspired by Gordon Research Conferences, with full-length 
talks followed by substantial time for discussion in the mornings, and 
shorter presentations in the afternoon. Please consider contributing 
a presentation on topics relatable to planetary origins, not 
necessarily from the list of five above.

Some funding is available to support local accommodation, food, and 
travel expenditures in Israel, the level will depend upon the total 
number of participants. Student participants may be considered for 
additional support.

We welcome broad attendance; please feel free to circulate this 
invitation to interested colleagues, and forgive us if you receive 
multiple copies of this invitation.

If you plan to attend, please complete the registration form using 
the following link. If you wish to present a talk or a poster, please 
also include a short abstract.

CALL FOR PAPERS: ON COMPARATIVE CLIMATOLOGY OF TERRESTRIAL PLANETS

The conference will be held June 25-28, 2012, at the Hotel Boulderado, 
Boulder Colorado.  Abstract deadline is April 12, 2012.

The goal of this conference is to look at climate in the broadest sense 
possible - by comparing the processes at work on the four terrestrial 
bodies, Earth, Venus, Mars, and Titan, and on terrestrial planets 
around other stars. These processes include the interactions of 
shortwave and thermal radiation with the atmosphere, condensation and 
vaporization of volatiles, atmospheric dynamics and chemistry, and the 
role of the surface, interior, sun and other external factors in the 
long-term evolution of climate. Conference talks will compare the 
scientific questions, methods, numerical models, and spacecraft remote 
sensing experiments for Earth, and the other planets, with the goal of 
identifying objectives for future research and missions.

Please visit:

for more information and to submit an your Indication of Interest form 
by February 27, 2012.

The meeting is sponsored by all four divisions of NASA/SMD and 
convened by VEXAG, MEPAG and OPAG. Other sponsors include IUGG/IAMAS 
and SwRI, LASP and the Planetary Society and meeting support is 
provided by LPI/USRA.
