questions using far-UV observations of the lunar surface. Topics of 
study include characterization of permanently shaded regions at the 
lunar poles, mapping of surface water frost and hydrates, and 
identifying regional space weathering effects. The far-UV map and 
spectra analyses to be performed include comparisons with other LRO 
and lunar datasets for detailed surveys of regions of interest.  
Applicants having experience with imaging and/or spectroscopy from 
space-based observations, and a background in scientific analysis 
and publication of lunar geology and/or volatiles topics are 
encouraged to apply.

This is a 1 year limited term position at Southwest Research Institute
in San Antonio, TX, with extension dependent on availability of 
funding.  Visit:

PLANETARY GEOPHYSICS POSTDOCTORAL FELLOWSHIP

The Universities Space Research Association's Lunar and Planetary 
Institute (LPI), in Houston Texas, invites applications for a 
postdoctoral fellowship in planetary geophysics.

The successful candidate will work with Dr. Walter Kiefer on a NASA-
funded project studying the nature of mantle convection on Mars and 
its effects on the thermal evolution and volcanic history of the 
planet. The candidate will also have the opportunity to conduct 
research in planetary geophysics of his or her own choosing.

The position requires a Ph.D. in Planetary Science or Geophysics with 
experience in computer programming and numerical modeling methods, 
particularly finite elements. Experience with parallel computing in a
Linux environment will be an asset. The position will be offered for 
an initial period of two years with a possible extension to a maximum
of three years.

Applicants should send a letter of interest, a curriculum vita 
listing relevant publications, a brief (maximum three pages) statement
of research interests, and a list of three references to 
resume@lpi.usra.edu.  Review of candidates will begin on 
March 15, 2012, with a hiring decision as soon as possible thereafter.

EXPLORATION TELEROBOTICS SYMPOSIUM

The NASA Goddard Space Flight Center will be holding an "Exploration 
Telerobotics Symposium" which will consider the use of robotic 
telepresence, ideally from astronauts at locations close to an 
exploration site, in putting human cognition, awareness, and dexterity
at those sites to achieve science and development. These locations 
might include Earth-Moon Lagrange points or lunar orbit for lunar 
surface opportunities, the vicinity of a NEO for asteroid exploration,
or Mars orbit for Mars surface activity. The symposium will be held 
on May 2-3, and will include senior members of the science, robotics 
(both space and terrestrial), and human space flight community. While
attendance is limited beyond invited participants, interest from the 
greater community is herein welcomed. See:

http://telerobotics.gsfc.nasa.gov/ 

for a more complete description of the symposium and registration 
information. There is no registration fee, though $60 will be 
collected at check-in for meals and refreshments. Foreign nationals 
are strongly encouraged to register within the next week.
