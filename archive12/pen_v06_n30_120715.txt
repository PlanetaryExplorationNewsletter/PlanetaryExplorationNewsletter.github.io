AGU FALL 2012 SPECIAL SESSION P21. PLANETARY SURFACES IN MOTION

With the advent of high spatial resolution and increasing temporal 
baselines, spacecraft observations have documented surface changes on 
planetary bodies at decadal, annual, and shorter timescales. These 
data provide fundamental insight into active surface changes, which 
vary in type, mode, and magnitude across the Solar System, and provide 
motivation for model, terrestrial analog, and laboratory studies that 
seek to better understand underlying physical mechanisms and relevant 
environment conditions. This session seeks abstracts focused on 
observations and modeling of surface processes, including fluvial, 
volcanic, mass wasting, aeolian and other agents that cause changes 
that can be monitored by spacecraft. Laboratory and field analog 
studies are also welcome.

AGU FALL 2012 SPECIAL SESSION P22. POLARIMETRY AS AN INVALUABLE TOOL
TO STUDY THE SOLAR SYSTEM AND BEYOND

Polarimetry is a powerful tool providing a wealth of information about 
astronomical objects that cannot be obtained by traditional 
photometric/spectroscopic observations. Recent applications include 
characterization of solar system objects (sun, planetary atmospheres,
Moon, comets, asteroids, satellites, ring systems, asteroids, dust) to 
the detection of exoplanets and identification of biological markers. 
This session is open to papers about recent spectropolarimetric
observations of solar system bodies, theoretical or experimental 
investigations, instrumental developments for spectropolarimeters to
be included in ground-based facilities or onboard future space 
missions, exoplanets and circumstellar envelopes.

Our featured invited speaker is Michael Mishchenko, NASA GISS.

AGU FALL 2012 SPECIAL SESSION P26. RECENT ADVANCES IN PLANETARY AEOLIAN
STUDIES

This session is organised to honour the tremendous contribution by 
Ron Greeley to planetary Aeolian Studies.

The combination of laboratory and field experiments, together with 
spacecraft data analysis, has proven to be a very fruitful approach for 
studying aeolian processes on a variety of planetary surfaces. 
Investigations of both terrestrial and planetary aeolian settings hold 
great potential for advancing our understanding of how sediments are 
mobilized, transported, and deposited by winds under diverse 
environmental conditions. 

We invite submissions on recent important findings in any aspect of 
planetary aeolian studies. Papers that consider aeolian landform 
development, sediment transport, wind tunnel experiments, modeling of 
sediment transport by wind, remote sensing of aeolian features, and 
field observations are particularly welcome.

Abstracts are due Wednesday 8 August 2012:

AGU FALL 2012 SPECIAL SESSION P28. SMALL BODIES AND THEIR 
INTERACTION WITH THE SPACE ENVIRONMENT

Airless bodies are heavily influenced by the surrounding space
environment, including plasma, solar photons, and energetic particles.
We invite contributions on these and related topics, including surface
weathering and electrostatics, volatile cycles and exospheres,
non-equilibrium plasma phenomena, and dust dynamics, at the Moon,
Mercury, moons of Mars and outer planets, and small bodies. Recent
years have seen new data from numerous lunar missions, MESSENGER, MEX,
Cassini, and Rosetta. In the coming years, we look forward to
observations from current/upcoming missions such as ARTEMIS and LADEE.
This session is open to observational, theoretical, and laboratory
topics, including comparative and predictive studies.

AGU FALL 2012 SPECIAL SESSION P31. TITAN'S ENIGMATIC UPPER ATMOSPHERE 
AND IONOSPHERE

The processes that control Titan's upper atmosphere and ionosphere 
remain enigmatic after eight years of observations from the Cassini 
mission. Instruments onboard the Cassini Orbiter have studied many 
aspects of Titan's atmosphere and coupled ionosphere both via in-situ 
measurements and remote observations. Recent studies of atmospheric 
composition and structure of Titan have produced substantial 
breakthroughs in our understanding of this complex chemical and 
dynamical system including results on the ionospheric outflow, ion 
composition and structure, and thermospheric and exospheric 
variability. In this session, we focus on recent and ongoing 
observations, modeling, and laboratory experimentation of Titan's 
upper atmosphere and ionosphere.

Abstract deadline: August 8th.

AGU FALL 2012 SPECIAL SESSION P34. WHAT LURKS IN THE MARTIAN ROCKS AND 
SOIL? INVESTIGATIONS OF SULFATES, PHOSPHATES, AND PERCHLORATES

Sulfates, phosphates, and perchlorates have been found on Mars from
orbit and/or from surface missions. Identification of these minerals 
(suites) can enable constraints on the Martian geochemical 
environments. This session will generate a discussion regarding the 
conditions for the formation of these minerals on Mars, and methods 
for identifying their geological environments and related fluid 
chemistry.  Abstracts describing discoveries of sulfates, phosphates, 
or perchlorates from surface missions and orbital spacecraft data, and 
those covering laboratory analyses and thermodynamic modeling relating 
to the hydration state of these minerals and their stability on Mars 
are welcome.

AGU FALL 2012 SPECIAL SESSION SA12. SOLAR SYSTEM AERONOMY: IONOSPHERES,
THERMOSPHERES, AURORAS, AND AIRGLOW

Dear Colleagues,

We kindly invite you to the AGU session SA12: "Solar System Aeronomy: 
Ionospheres, Thermospheres, Auroras and Airglow", which will be held in 
San Francisco, 3-7 December 2012.

The atmospheres of the solar system are shaped by interactions with 
solar forcings and their surrounding space environments. The chemistry, 
dynamics, and energetics of ionospheres and thermospheres are 
controlled by these external influences, which include solar photons, 
solar particles, and plasma and magnetic fields associated with the 
planetary object's internal magnetic field and magnetosphere. Optical 
emissions, such as aurora and airglow, are an important diagnostic tool 
for remote sensing of ionospheric and thermospheric conditions. This 
session focuses on recent developments in solar system aeronomy 
including results from observations, numerical modeling, and 
laboratory experiments.

Abstract submission deadline: 8 August 2012 23:59 ET.

[NASA] UPDATES ON THE NASA AO FOR ESA JUICE MISSION

An amendment to the NASA AO for the ESA JUICE mission makes two changes 
to the AO: 1) it requires submission of Notices of Intent (NOIs) by 
July 27, 2012, and 2) it clarifies the process for NASA review of 
proposals submitted to ESA. Changes are indicated in bold type in the 
updated AO. NASA is requiring NOIs from U.S.-led proposal teams 
planning to submit proposals to the NASA AO in order to allow NASA and 
ESA sufficient time to properly organize the technical and scientific 
review of all proposals. Proposals will not be accepted unless an NOI 
is submitted by the July 27 deadline.
 
The Pre-Proposal Conference for the NASA AO is being scheduled. The 
date, time, and agenda will be posted on the JUICE NASA Acquisition 
website: 

http://soma.larc.nasa.gov/juice/ 

in the near future. The conference will be virtual and participation 
will be provided via Webex; travel to attend the conference in person 
is not necessary.
 
Questions may be submitted to Dr. Curt Niebur, curt.niebur@nasa.gov, 
the NASA Program Scientist for the ESA JUICE mission. Questions and 
answers will be regularly posted to the JUICE NASA Acquisition website 
starting this week.

DPS WORKSHOP FOR PLANNING YOUR SOLAR SYSTEM OBSERVATIONS WITH JWST

The Science Working Group of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has 
a dedicated effort to establish the full capabilities of this facility 
for Solar System Science. JWST is an infrared-optimized telescope to 
be placed at the Earth-Sun Lagrange 2 point. It is scheduled for launch 
in 2018, and will have a robust suite of astronomical instrumentation 
available for General Observer proposals.

In order to fully realize the maximum potential of JWST for Solar 
System observations, we are seeking experienced observers of solar 
system targets to participate and provide input in an upcoming 
workshop held at the DPS meeting in Reno, Nevada on Sunday October 14, 
2012 (9am-noon). This workshop will provide you an opportunity to learn 
about the current instrument specifications and observing modes, as 
well as the observatory capabilities (brightness limits, moving target 
tracking, and others). Our goal is to fully engage the Solar System 
community to provide the tools needed to plan observations with JWST.  
A key output of the workshop will be capability objectives for the JWST 
team to consider for further pre-launch studies. More information can 
be found at:

[NASA] LETTER FROM SARA: CHINA FAQ AND NEW VOLUNTEER REVIEWER FORM

Dear Colleagues,
 
If you collaborate with anyone in China you should read our new FAQ. 
Our appropriation (Public Law 112-55, SEC. 539) contained a brief 
statement, the bottom line if which is that NASA funds, including ROSES 
research grants, cannot be used "...to participate, collaborate, or 
coordinate bilaterally in any way with China..."
 
We expand somewhat on what this actually means in practical terms for 
ROSES grantees in our new FAQ that can be found as a link off our 
normal ROSES FAQ:  

http://science.nasa.gov/researchers/sara/faqs/#1 

or you can get to it directly by going to 

http://science.nasa.gov/researchers/sara/faqs/prc-faq-roses-2012/  

Another new addition to the SARA web page is our new volunteer 
reviewer web form: we are currently seeking reviewers for Laboratory 
Analysis of Returned Samples, Exobiology, and Moon and Mars Analog 
Missions Activities. You can find this form at: 

http://science.nasa.gov/researchers/volunteer-review-panels/
 
As always, selection statistics can be found on the grant stats 
page at:
