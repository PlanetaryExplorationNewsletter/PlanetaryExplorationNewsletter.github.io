TENURE TRACK FACULTY POSITION IN THEORETICAL ASTROPHYSICS AT 
UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND

The Department of Astronomy at the University of Maryland College Park
invites applications for a tenure-track faculty position. Outstanding
theorists in any field of astronomy including planetary science, will 
be considered. A PhD in physics, astronomy or a related discipline is 
required, and the successful candidate must have an established record 
of research excellence. As the duties of this position include 
undergraduate and graduate teaching, a potential for teaching 
excellence is necessary. We are searching for candidates at the 
Assistant Professor (tenure-track) level, but will consider 
applications for a more senior (tenured) rank in exceptional cases.

Applications must be submitted through:

http://jobs.umd.edu/applicants/Central?quickFind=57797

A complete application must include a CV, a statement of research 
interests and plans, and a statement of teaching philosophy. In 
addition, the candidate must arrange for 3 letters of reference to be 
sent by e-mail to profsearch@astro.umd.edu.  For full consideration, 
all application materials (including letters) must be received by 
30 November 2012. Any queries concerning this position can be directed 
to the chair of the search committee, Prof. Derek Richardson 
(dcr@astro.umd.edu).

PERMANENT FACULTY POSITIONS IN PLANETARY SCIENCES AT FLORIDA INSTITUTE
OF TECHNOLOGY

The Department of Physics and Space Sciences at the Florida Institute 
of Technology invites applications for up to two permanent faculty 
positions in planetary sciences. These positions may be at any rank: 
assistant through full professor. We seek to expand our current space 
sciences program to include planetary geology, atmospheres, 
magnetospheres, or interiors and/or exoplanets. For both positions, 
candidates must have a Ph.D. in physics, planetary sciences, space 
sciences, astronomy, or a related discipline. Successful candidates 
must demonstrate the ability to develop a vigorous externally funded 
research program as well as the enthusiasm and drive to teach and 
mentor undergraduate and graduate students. Candidates with experience 
in space instrumentation are particularly encouraged to apply.

Information about the department and current research activities can be 
found at: 

http://cos.fit.edu/pss/ 

Please send a cover letter, CV, statement of research and teaching 
experience and interests, and the names of at least three references, 
preferably in a single PDF file, to searchpss@fit.edu. Review of 
applications will begin immediately, and applications will be accepted 
until the positions are filled. 

Florida Tech is an equal opportunity employer.

TENURE-TRACK FACULTY POSITION AT CASE WESTERN RESERVE UNIVERSITY

The Department of Earth, Environmental, and Planetary Sciences at Case
Western Reserve University seeks candidates for a tenure-track faculty
growth position. We seek outstanding candidates who will complement 
existing departmental strengths in planetary sciences, geochemistry, 
and surficial processes. It is anticipated that the position will be 
filled at the Assistant Professor level, but senior candidates are 
also encouraged to apply. Candidates at the Assistant Professor level 
should demonstrate promise for research and teaching excellence; 
Associate Professor candidates should have established a significant 
professional reputation; candidates for Professor should be 
internationally recognized for leadership and scholarship in their 
discipline. All positions require completion of the PhD degree by 
July 1, 2013 and a competitive record of research commensurate with 
rank. The successful candidate will be expected to teach and mentor
undergraduate and graduate students within the department, including
teaching both introductory and disciplinary courses, and to conduct a
vigorous, externally-funded research program that involves 
post-doctoral, graduate and undergraduate students. The typical 
teaching load is 2-3 courses per year.

Application deadline is November 15, 2012.

NASA POSTDOCTORAL FELLOWSHIPS

The NASA Postdoctoral Program (NPP) offers scientists and engineers 
unique opportunities to conduct research at NASA Centers. Each NPP 
fellowship opportunity is designed to advance NASA research in a 
specific project related to space science, earth science, aeronautics, 
exploration systems, lunar science, astrobiology, or astrophysics.

Applicants must have a Ph.D. or equivalent degree in hand before 
beginning the fellowship, but may apply while completing the degree 
requirements. U.S. citizens, Lawful Permanent Residents, and foreign 
nationals eligible for J-1 status as a Research Scholar may apply.

Stipends start at $53,500 per year, with supplements for high 
cost-of-living areas and for certain academic specialties. Financial 
assistance is available for relocation and health insurance, and 
$8,000 per year is provided for professional travel.

Applications are accepted three times each year: March 1, July 1, and 
November 1.

[NASA] THE KEPLER GUEST OBSERVER PROGRAM

This program element solicits proposals for the acquisition and 
analysis of new scientific data from the Kepler mission, which is the 
tenth mission launched under NASA's Discovery Program. Cycle 5 will be 
the first full cycle of Guest Observer (GO) observations in Kepler's 
extended mission phase, and with that transition the scope of the 
program has now been expanded to include proposals for exoplanet and 
exoplanet-related scientific observations. Specifically, under Cycle 5, 
the Kepler GO program is open to:

i)   proposals addressing any area of astrophysics outside of the 
     exoplanet Key Project study
ii)  proposals for short cadence observations of known exoplanet 
     candidates that are not currently being observed in short cadence; 
     and
iii) proposals for long cadence observations of new targets for the 
     identification of planets transits.

Notices of Intent are requested by December 7, 2012, and proposals are 
due by January 18, 2013. Go to:

THE PRESENT-DAY HABITABILITY OF MARS

The UCLA Institute for Planets and Exoplanets, the UK Center for 
Astrobiology and the NASA Astrobiology Institute invite you to 
participate in a two-day conference in February 2013 that will examine 
the present-day habitability of Mars.

Major topics to be considered include:

Mars Salts and Perchlorates
Current Mars Liquid Water Activity
Early MSL Results
Redox Potentials for Martian Life
Active Martian Geochemical Cycles
Implications for Mars Planetary Protection Policies

The conference will be held in historic Royce Hall on the UCLA campus 
February 4-6, 2013. The first two days of the conference will consist 
of a set of 30-minute invited and contributed talks interspersed with 
discussions. The entire conference will be open to remote participation 
via NASA's Astrobiology Institute "Workshop Without Walls" webcast. On 
February 6th, there will be an optional field trip to JPL, which will 
include a tour of the Mars Science Laboratory facilities.

NEW PDS SEARCH CAPABILITY FOR CASSINI PLANET AND SATELLITE DATA

The PDS Rings Node has incorporated detailed metadata about Saturn and
its satellites into OPUS, our search engine for outer planets data. 
OPUS now supports Cassini ISS, VIMS, UVIS and CIRS* data sets. Search
constraints include latitudes, longitudes, viewing and illumination
geometry, distances and resolution. Search capabilities for ring data
sets have also been enhanced.

For planet and satellite searches, select the body on the "Cassini
Surface Geometry beta test" tab, and then select the new tab that OPUS
will provide for the surface geometry for that body. Search results are
updated with each additional constraint entered. Total hits are updated
at the top of the page. Click "View Results" to preview and download 
data.

OPUS is at: 

http://pds-rings.seti.org/search/ 

Feedback is strongly encouraged.

*CIRS data are currently only indexed through June 2010; an update will
follow.
