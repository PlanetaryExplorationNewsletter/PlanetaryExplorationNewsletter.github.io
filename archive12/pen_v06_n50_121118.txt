NASA POSTDOCTORAL FELLOWSHIPS

The NASA Postdoctoral Program (NPP) offers scientists and engineers 
unique opportunities to conduct research at NASA Centers. Each NPP 
fellowship opportunity is designed to advance NASA research in a 
specific project related to space science, earth science, aeronautics, 
exploration systems, lunar science, astrobiology, or astrophysics.

Applicants must have a Ph.D. or equivalent degree in hand before 
beginning the fellowship, but may apply while completing the degree 
requirements. U.S. citizens, Lawful Permanent Residents, and foreign 
nationals eligible for J-1 status as a Research Scholar may apply.

Stipends start at $53,500 per year, with supplements for high 
cost-of-living areas and for certain academic specialties. Financial 
assistance is available for relocation and health insurance, and 
$8,000 per year is provided for professional travel.

Applications are accepted three times each year: March 1, July 1, and 
November 1.

PLANETARY GEOMORPHOLOGY AT EGU 2013

Vienna Austria 7-12 April 2013, GM10.1

The Planetary Geomorphology session welcomes abstracts concerning 
landforms and the processes that shaping them on all solar system 
bodies. Earth analogue studies, flume/simulation work and novel 
approaches using remote sensing data are especially encouraged. This 
session has always provided a stimulating forum for cross-disciplinary 
discussion and we hope you'll join us once again to bring geomorphology 
and planetary science closer together. The final deadline for abstracts 
is 9th January 2013.

Students - the deadline for financial support applications is fast 
approaching - 30th November! Go to:

FACULTY POSITIONS: BOSTON UNIVERSITY

The Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering (ECE) at Boston 
University is seeking candidates for several anticipated faculty 
positions. All areas and ranks will be considered. Of particular 
interest are entry-level and mid-career candidates in instrumentation 
and analog/digital design. Candidates with research interests that 
transcend the traditional boundaries of ECE are strongly encouraged to 
apply, including potential collaborations with BU's multidisciplinary 
Center for Space Physics (bu.edu/csp). Applicants interested in growing 
a vibrant university program in space instrumentation or small 
satellite technology are particularly welcome. Joint appointments with 
other BU departments and with the Division of Material Science & 
Engineering and Division of Systems Engineering are available for 
candidates with appropriate experience and interests.

Qualified candidates must possess a relevant PhD, and have a 
demonstrable ability to teach effectively and develop a funded 
research program in their area of expertise. Women, minorities, and 
candidates from other underrepresented groups are especially encouraged 
to apply. Applications are submitted online at:

https://academicjobsonline.org/ajo/jobs/1981

The application deadline is December 31, 2012. For further information, 
go to:

ATMOSPHERES AND ICES IN PLANETARY SYSTEMS SYMPOSIUM DURING THE DAVOS
ATMOSPHERE AND CRYOSPHERE ASSEMBLY (DACA-13)

8-12 July 2013

http://www.daca-13.ch/

The International Commission on Planetary Atmospheres and Evolution
(ICPAE, www.atm.ox.ac.uk/icpae) will convene this at the International
Association of Meteorology and Atmospheric Sciences IAMAS and the
International Association of Cryospheric Sciences IACS, both
Associations of the International Union of Geodesy and Geophysics IUGG.

We invite papers reporting progress on our understanding of (i) giant
planetary systems (cold gas and ice giants, their rings and icy
satellites); (ii) terrestrial planets (lower, middle and upper
atmosphere, ionosphere and surface ices); (iii) the cold conditions of
icy bodies in the distance solar system (e.g., Pluto, dwarf planets,
KBOs and comets); and (iv) the extreme physicochemical conditions to be
found on extrasolar planets.

In addition, papers reviewing the history of observing planetary
atmospheres from space based observations are also welcome to mark the
50th anniversary of the successful Mariner 2 observations of Venus in
December 1962.

Session C1.1: Atmospheres and ices on terrestrial planets
Session C1.2: Atmospheres and ices on outer planets

Limited travel support is available to young scholars to attend the
meeting.
