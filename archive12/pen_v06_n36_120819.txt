VOLCANO-LITHOSPHERE INTERACTIONS ON THE TERRESTRIAL PLANETS 
POSTDOCTORAL FELLOWSHIP: LUNAR AND PLANETARY INSTITUTE

The Universities Space Research Association - Houston invites 
applications for a postdoctoral fellowship in geophysical studies of 
the growth/evolution of large volcanic edifices and provinces on the 
terrestrial planets.

The candidate will work with Dr. Patrick McGovern exploring mechanical 
interactions between intrusive and extrusive volcanic edifice growth, 
lithospheric flexural response, and magma ascent, using numerical 
modeling techniques, including Finite Element (FEM) and Distinct 
Element (DEM) Methods. Research will also entail analysis of imagery, 
topography, gravity, and spectral datasets for large planetary 
volcanoes in order to constrain the modeling efforts. Potential 
bodies of interest include Venus, Io, the Moon, Earth, and Mars.

Requirements are a recent Ph.D. in geophysics or geology. Experience 
quantitative modeling of geophysical, geological, or magmatic 
processes with advanced codes as COMSOL Multiphysics (FEM) and PFC 
(DEM). Programming languages, MATLAB or FORTRAN 95 desirable.  The 
position is two years with a possible extension to three years.

Send letter of interest, curriculum vita with a list of relevant 
publications, brief statement of research interests, and three 
references to resume@lpi.usra.edu.  Further information may be 
found at:

www.lpi.usra.edu

NASA POSTDOCTORAL FELLOWSHIPS

The NASA Postdoctoral Program (NPP) offers scientists and engineers 
unique opportunities to conduct research at NASA Centers. Each NPP 
fellowship opportunity is designed to advance NASA research in a 
specific project related to space science, earth science, aeronautics, 
exploration systems, lunar science, astrobiology, or astrophysics.

Applicants must have a Ph.D. or equivalent degree in hand before 
beginning the fellowship, but may apply while completing the degree 
requirements. U. S. citizens, Lawful Permanent Residents, and foreign 
nationals eligible for J-1 status as a Research Scholar may apply.

Stipends start at $53,500 per year, with supplements for high cost-
of-living areas and for certain academic specialties. Financial
assistance is available for relocation and health insurance, and 
$8,000 per year is provided for professional travel.

Applications are accepted three times each year: March 1, July 1, 
and November 1.

WORKSHOP ON THE EVOLUTION AND CONSTITUTION OF MERCURY'S INTERIOR

October 30, 2012 - November 1, 2012

The workshop Evolution and Constitution of Mercury's Interior will be 
held on October 30 - November 1, 2012 at the Park Central Hotel in 
New York, NY. This international meeting will explore recent results 
from NASA's MESSENGER mission as well as implications for the 
forthcoming ESA/JAXA BepiColombo mission. The workshop is organized 
around three thematic issues regarding Mercury's interior:
 
* Origin, structure, and bulk composition of Mercury
* Evolution of Mercury's crust and mantle       
* Core evolution and magnetic field generation

Registration and additional information is available at:

10TH MEETING OF THE VENUS EXPLORATION AND ANALYSIS GROUP (VEXAG)

The tenth VEXAG meeting will be held 13-15 November 2012. This 2-1/2 
day meeting will be held at or near NASA Headquarters in downtown 
Washington, DC.  The primary objective of this meeting is to review 
and update the Goals and Objectives for Venus Exploration. Time will 
be made available for science presentations as well as updates from 
the community on issues relevant to Venus science and exploration. 
Please watch for additional information regarding advance registration

[NASA] ANNOUNCEMENT OF FLIGHT OPPORTUNITIES #5 NOW OPEN

Solicitation: NASA Announcement of Flight Opportunities (AFO) for 
Payloads Maturing Crosscutting Technologies that Advance Multiple 
Future Space Missions to Flight Readiness Status.

Applications due: 5:30 PM ET, September 21, 2012
Selection announcement: November 2012 (target)

The solicitation is available at:

http://nspires.nasaprs.com 

Select "Solicitations," then select "Open Solicitations," and, select 
"NOCT110 Announcement of Flight Opportunities."  

NASA's Office of the Chief Technologist (OCT) seeks to mature towards 
flight readiness status crosscutting technologies that perform relevant 
environment testing and advance multiple future space missions. To 
facilitate this goal, NASA is providing access to certain flight 
opportunities available to the Agency, on a no-exchange-of-funds 
basis, to entities that have technology payloads meeting specified 
criteria. The payloads may be exposed to a near-zero or reduced 
gravity environment by flying on aircraft that provide parabolic 
flight trajectories and on sRLVs that are potentially capable of 
flying to altitudes above 100 km. For flight tests that do not 
require microgravity, but do require the temperature, pressure and 
atmospheric conditions of high altitudes, balloon flights are 
available. For specific information on vehicle and flight 
characteristics refer to:

LESSONS LEARNED IN DECADAL PLANNING IN SPACE SCIENCE: AN NRC WORKSHOP

Join the Space Studies Board (SSB) and the Board on Physics and 
Astronomy (BPA) on November 12-13, 2012, at The National Academies 
Beckman Center in Irvine, California in a workshop that will identify 
lessons learned and best practices from the most recent decadal 
surveys: solar and space physics (2012), planetary science (2011), 
astronomy and astrophysics (2010), and Earth science and applications 
from space (2007). The workshop will bring together a variety of 
stakeholders in the space community both inside and outside of NASA 
who are impacted by and/or are responsible for the formulation and
implementation of the decadal surveys and mid-decade reviews. 
Development of the workshop is in progress under the auspices of a 
planning committee appointed by the National Research Council.
