[NASA] OPAG UPDATE

The next Outer Planets Assessment Group Meeting is just around the 
corner. We will meet 10-11 January, 2013, at the Georgia Tech Global 
Learning Center in Atlanta, adjacent to the GT campus. Logistical 
details and an updated agenda can be found at the OPAG website: 

http://www.lpi.usra.edu/opag

Student travel funds are available. Please send Curt Niebur at NASA 
HQ a CV and a brief statement as to why you want to go 
(curt.niebur@nasa.gov).  

The meeting promises to be rich, productive, and rather important, 
as we chart the path forward for Outer Planet Exploration in an era 
of constrained budgets.

Sincerely, Bill McKinnon, OPAG Chair (mckinnon@wustl.edu)

[NASA/PDS] LUNAR RECONNAISSANCE ORBITER DATA RELEASE 12

The NASA Planetary Data System is pleased to announce a new delivery 
of Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) data for the following 
instruments: CRaTER, DLRE, LAMP, LEND, LOLA, LROC, Mini-RF, and RSS.

In general, LRO Release 12 includes data collected between 
June 15, 2012 and September 14, 2012.

To access the above data, please visit the following link:

http://pds.nasa.gov/subscription_service/SS-20121215.html

PDS offers two services for searching the LRO archives:

The Planetary Image Atlas at the Imaging Node allows selection of LRO 
data by specific search criteria. 

http://pds-imaging.jpl.nasa.gov/search/lro/

The Lunar Orbital Data Explorer at the Geosciences Node allows 
searching and downloading of LRO data and other lunar orbital data 
sets (Clementine and Lunar Prospector).

[NASA/PDS] GRAIL RELEASE 1

The Planetary Data System (PDS) announces the release of the following 
Gravity Recovery and Interior Laboratory (GRAIL) data:

- LGRS EDR: Raw science data originating from the Lunar Gravity 
  Ranging System (LGRS) on each of the two spacecraft comprising the 
  GRAIL mission.
- RSS EDR: Raw radio science data and ancillary files from the GRAIL 
  mission.
- LGRS CDR: Calibrated and resampled data from the LGRS on each of 
  the two spacecraft comprising the GRAIL mission.
- NAIF SPICE: Complete set of SPICE kernels created by GRAIL 
  Navigation and archived by NAIF.
 
The GRAIL mission placed two spacecraft into orbit around the Moon to 
study its internal structure. By measuring the distance of one orbiter 
relative to the other, the orbital perturbations caused by the Moon 
could be observed. Combining this with the orbiter position as 
determined from Earth-based observations, the mass distribution on 
the Moon could be determined.

Derived and ancillary data products will be released in October, 2013.

NASA POSTDOCTORAL FELLOWSHIPS

The NASA Postdoctoral Program (NPP) offers scientists and engineers 
unique opportunities to conduct research at NASA Centers. Each NPP 
fellowship opportunity is designed to advance NASA research in a 
specific project related to space science, earth science, aeronautics, 
exploration systems, lunar science, astrobiology, or astrophysics.

Applicants must have a Ph.D. or equivalent degree in hand before 
beginning the fellowship, but may apply while completing the degree 
requirements. U. S. citizens, Lawful Permanent Residents, and foreign 
nationals eligible for J-1 status as a Research Scholar may apply.

Stipends start at $53,500 per year, with supplements for high cost-of-
living areas and for certain academic specialties. Financial assistance 
is available for relocation and health insurance, and $8,000 per year 
is provided for professional travel.

Applications are accepted three times each year: March 1, July 1, and 
November 1.

JOB ANNOUNCEMENT: RESEARCH ASSOCIATE AT LASP

The space physics and planetary groups at the Laboratory for 
Atmospheric and Space Physics (LASP) at the University of Colorado (CU) 
are involved in several current and near-term space flight missions. 
There is funding to support up to three research positions at levels I 
(post-doc), II, and III in support of current missions such as THEMIS, 
RBSP, and JUNO, as well as the near-term MAVEN and MMS missions.

The focus of the positions is on data analysis from the missions listed 
above. Theoretical and numerical modeling studies are also welcome as 
long as the proposed work promises to use supporting data from one or 
more of these missions.

The candidate will be working closely together with Dr. Andersson, 
Prof. Bagenal, Prof. Ergun and Dr. Eriksson. 

Each position will initially be a one year contract with possible 
extension. We will accept applications until May 1, 2013.

Please submit your resume/vitae, list of three references, proof of 
highest degree earned, and a cover letter describing your proposed 
work plan in support of one or more of the listed missions at:

MICROSYMPOSIUM 54, LUNAR FARSIDE AND POLES: NEW DESTINATIONS FOR 
EXPLORATION

March 16-17th, 2013 (just prior to LPSC 44)
Woodlands Waterway Marriot
Woodlands, Texas

The Moon provides a fundamental frame of reference for understanding 
the formation, early history, and evolution of terrestrial planetary 
bodies. An international Renaissance in lunar exploration is is 
changing our perception of the nature of the Moon, its origin, and 
its evolution. Missions have provided new global coverage, with 
particular insights for the Lunar Farside and Poles. What is this 
Renaissance teaching us about traditional lunar compositional, 
interior, and historical paradigms? What ideas has it challenged?
How do these evolving concepts lead us to new questions and a new 
strategy for future exploration of the Moon? Microsymposium 54 will 
present a summary of new discoveries, and ponder their implications 
for the next generation of significant scientific problems and future 
goals and destinations for robotic and human lunar exploration. For 
more information, visit Microsymposium 54 and the online registration 
form. 

Co-conveners: Carle Pieters, Maria Zuber, James Head, Igor Mitrofanov, 
Alexander Basilevsky, Amy Barr, Ben Weiss, and Harald Hiesinger

Co-Sponsored by Brown University, the Vernadsky Institute, and the 
Brown-MIT NASA Lunar Science Institute.

WOULD YOU LIKE TO SEE A VOLCANOLOGY SESSION AT LPSC 2013?

We were denied a special session, but are hoping for an informal 
session focused on planetary volcanology at the next LPSC. Towards 
that end, we encourage the submission of abstracts focusing on 
planetary volcanology, especially the topics of lava emplacement and 
resultant geomorphology. Please help us achieve critical mass so that 
this topic will warrant an informal oral/poster session. 

Thank you,
Serina Diniega & Suzanne Smrekar (JPL)

[NASA] UNDERGRADUATE STUDENT INSTRUMENT PROJECT

NSPIRES Release Date: December 21, 2012
Question and Answer Telecon: January 17, 2013                               
Proposals Due: April 5, 2013, 5 pm EDT

SMD is releasing this Undergraduate Student Instrument Project 
Educational Flight Opportunity to solicit U.S. university proposals 
to develop an Earth or space science payload that will fly on a NASA 
suborbital vehicle, such as a sounding rocket, balloon, aircraft, or 
commercial suborbital reusable launch vehicle. The maximum funding per 
project is $50K. The cost of payload integration with the suborbital 
vehicle and the launch/flight is provided by NASA at no cost to the 
university team. The selected projects must be launched or flight-ready
within 13-16 months from the project initiation date. SMD expects to 
select approximately 15-20 projects, subject to available funding.

This solicitation is available at:

http://nspires.nasaprs.com/ 

then "Solicitations" to "Open Solicitations" to "NNH13ZDA004N"

[NASA] LADEE GUEST INVESTIGATOR PROGRAM

This solicitation is for investigations in the LADEE Guest Investigator 
Program (GIP). The goals of the program are to: 
a) enhance the scientific return from the LADEE mission by broadening 
participation in the mission and 
b) augment the existing LADEE science team to include new members 
conducting investigations that broaden and/or complement the funded 
Principal Investigator (PI) and Co-Investigator (Co-I)-led 
investigations, thus maximizing the contribution of LADEE to the 
future exploration and scientific understanding of the Moon. Because 
the intention is to enhance and broaden the scientific return, 
investigations submitted by LADEE PIs and Co-Is will not be considered.

NOIs due: February 22, 2013
Proposals due: March 29, 2013
