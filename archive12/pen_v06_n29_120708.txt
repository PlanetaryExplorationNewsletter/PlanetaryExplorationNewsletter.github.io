AGU FALL 2012 SPECIAL SESSION P007. EYES ON ENCELADUS

Enceladus appears to have all the requirements for life: energy, 
liquid water, organic material, nitrogen and other essential elements,
making investigation of this body especially promising and urgent. In 
this session, we will focus on the most recent observational, 
theoretical and modeling results on the chemistry, state and dynamics 
of Enceladus' jets and plumes, the moon's thermal and interior state, 
geologic activity, as well as its astrobiological potential. New 
results from the recent Cassini flybys of Enceladus should be 
submitted to this session.

Abstract deadline: August 8, 2012, 23:59ET/3:59+1 GMT

AGU FALL 2012 SPECIAL SESSION P011. LABORATORY INVESTIGATIONS 
SUPPORTING ANALYSIS OF DATASETS FROM MARS, THE MOON, AND OTHER 
PLANETARY BODIES

Planetary missions over the past decade have gathered a wealth of data, 
including spectral (e.g., TES, OMEGA, CRISM, M3), thermophysical (e.g., 
Diviner, THEMIS), and geochemical/mineralogical (e.g., GRS, APXS, MB, 
CheMin, ChemCam, SAM). Rigorous laboratory investigations are required 
for instrument calibration and refinement of data interpretation. This 
session will focus on measurements/experiments that relate to 
interpretation of remote sensing or in situ data from planetary 
bodies. Studies that utilize multiple methods/datasets, analog 
materials, and advance quantitative compositional analyses of orbital 
data or the interpretation of MSL/MER instrument data are especially 
encouraged.

AGU FALL 2012 SPECIAL SESSION P016. PLANETARY ATMOSPHERES AND EVOLUTION

Understanding planetary atmospheres and their evolution is one of the 
most challenging topics in planetary sciences. The competing 
influences of planetary geology, geochemistry, climate, atmospheric 
chemistry, and biology (on the Earth) need to be weighed. While 
geochemical and geological data provide constraints for the Earth, 
data from planetary missions and astronomical observations are 
necessary for other planets. Extrasolar planets have heightened 
interest in planetary atmospheres, for it is by analysis of their 
atmospheres that we will assess the characteristics and habitability 
of these objects. This session welcomes both observational and 
theoretical studies relevant to planetary atmospheres and their 
evolution in and out of our solar system.

AGU FALL 2012 SPECIAL SESSION P24. RAPID ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE AND THE 
FATE OF PLANETARY HABITABILITY

Dear Colleague, 

We would like to draw your attention to a special session at the 
upcoming Fall AGU meeting in San Francisco, and request that you 
consider submitting an abstract to this session.  Suggested topics 
follow:

"Rapid environmental change can be used as a scientific bridge, 
relating astrobiology to earth, planetary, and space sciences in the 
study of how life may adapt through abrupt climate crises. Recent 
discoveries are inspiring the astrobiology community to re-examine 
its understanding of how rapidly planetary habitats can be 
redistributed and the variability of habitable zones around stars. 
Abstracts on the intertwined aspects of changing habitability, 
including the complex interactions among astronomical, geological, 
and climatic forces, on the Earth and beyond, are welcome."

We will consider abstracts covering topics such as:
- exoplanetary habitability
- icy satellite environments for life and spatio-temporal changes
- climate change and terrestrial analogs for planetary exploration
- mars environmental change and life
- asteroid and comet impacts on environment and life

AGU FALL 2012 SPECIAL SESSION P34. WHAT LURKS IN THE MARTIAN ROCKS 
AND SOIL? INVESTIGATIONS OF SULFATES, PHOSPHATES, AND PERCHLORATES

Sulfates, phosphates, and perchlorates have been found on Mars from
orbit and/or from surface missions.  Identification of these minerals
(suites) can enable constraints on the Martian geochemical
environments.  This session will generate a discussion regarding the
conditions for the formation of these minerals on Mars, and methods for
identifying their geological environments and related fluid chemistry.  
Abstracts describing discoveries of sulfates, phosphates, or
perchlorates from surface missions and orbital spacecraft data, and
those covering laboratory analyses and thermodynamic modeling relating
to the hydration state of these minerals and their stability on Mars
are welcome.

AGU FALL 2012 SPECIAL SESSION SH017. SUN-GRAZING COMETS AS SOLAR 
PROBES: WHAT GOES ON BEHIND THE OCCULTER DISK?

On December 16, 2011, comet C/2011 W3 (Lovejoy) became instantly 
famous when it not only survived perihelion but had its journey 
through the corona and around the Sun observed by a large array of 
solar and astrophysical missions. We have now seen two comets 
traversing the solar corona, within 100,000 km of the surface of 
the Sun. However, much remains to be learned about comets and the 
Sun from observing the Kreutz sun-grazing family. This session 
solicits papers on the properties of sun-grazing comets and what 
their perihelion passage reveals about the Sun. Topics include 
observations of sun-grazing comets, the accurate determination of 
their orbital elements, models of the comet nucleus, coma, and tail 
as they pass through perihelion, the fate of the comet material in 
the solar corona, and the response of the coronal plasma and magnetic 
field.

AGU FALL 2012 SPECIAL SESSION. INTERNAL STRUCTURE & COMPOSITION OF 
SMALL SOLAR SYSTEM BODIES

Dear colleagues,

Julie Castillo-Rogez & I are organizing a session for the AGU 
Fall conference entitled "Internal Structure & Composition of Small 
Solar System Bodies" session scheduled for the AGU Fall Conference, 
San Francisco, CA (Dec 3-7 2012).

The composition and physical properties of Small Solar System Bodies 
(SSSBs), remnants of the formation of planets, are key to better 
understand our solar system. Increased knowledge of their surface 
properties and their potential as resources are also necessary to 
prepare for robotic and human exploration. Hints about the internal 
structure and composition of SSSBs have been acquired recently thanks 
to flyby/rendezvous data from space missions, study of multiple 
asteroid systems, or close encounter between asteroids. This 
session welcomes abstracts on the internal structure and composition 
of SSSBs based on space and ground-based data, numerical models, 
and instrument/mission concepts for future exploration.

We encourage you to submit an abstract keeping in mind that the 
deadline is on August 8, 2012. 

We look forward to seeing you in San Francisco in December 2012.

Cordially,
Franck Marchis
