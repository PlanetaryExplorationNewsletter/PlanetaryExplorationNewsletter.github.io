CALL FOR ABSTRACTS, EGU SESSION: AURORA AND AIRGLOW IN PLANETARY 
ATMOSPHERES

Dear Colleagues,

We kindly invite you to the EGU session PS5.2/AS4.19/ST6.3 "Aurora and 
Airglow in Planetary Atmospheres", which will be held in Vienna, 
Austria, 22-27 April 2012.

Emission processes are phenomena of critical importance for the 
understanding of the physico-chemistry, the dynamics, the evolution, 
and the thermal equilibrium of planetary upper atmospheres and 
mesospheres. Depending on the nature of the emissions several 
mechanisms may be invoked, including particle precipitation (electrons, 
protons, cosmic rays, etc.), photoexcitation, chemical processes and 
transport of atoms. 

This session focuses on the comparison between numerical models, 
theory and observations of various types of airglow and aurorae.  
We invite presentations on the atmospheres of Mars, Venus, Titan, 
Jupiter, Saturn, Mercury, comets and Earth.  Recent results from 
planetary missions such as Mars Express, Venus Express and Cassini 
(not an exhaustive list) are welcome. Laboratory and joint developments 
between theoreticians and experimentalists will also be addressed, as 
a critical step towards a better understanding of airglow/aurorae 
phenomena at Earth and the other planets.

Abstract submission deadline: 17 January 2012

CALL FOR ABSTRACTS, EGU SESSION: POLARIMETRY AS AN INVALUABLE TOOL 
TO STUDY THE SOLAR SYSTEM AND BEYOND

Dear colleagues,

We invite you to submit an abstract to the EGU 2012 session 
"PS1.2/AS4.21/ST6.1 Polarimetry as an Invaluable Tool to Study the 
Solar System and Beyond", to be held in Vienna, Austria, 17-22 April 
2012. Deadline for abstract submission is January, 17th.

Polarimetry is a powerful tool providing a wealth of information about 
objects from the Earth atmosphere to the far universe that cannot be 
obtained by traditional photometric/spectroscopic observations. 

In the solar system polarimetry has been widely used, e.g., to 
characterize the surface of atmosphereless bodies, dust and aerosols 
in planetary atmospheres, or to explore the magnetism of the solar 
atmosphere. 

This session is open to papers about recent polarimetric observations 
of solar system bodies including the Earth and the Sun, theoretical 
or experimental investigations and instrumental developments for 
polarimeters to be included in ground-based facilities or onboard 
future space missions. Contributions about detection and/or 
characterization of exoplanets with polarimetry are also welcome.

GSA 2012 ANNUAL MEETING SESSION PROPOSALS DUE JANUARY 10

The next Geological Society of America Annual Meeting will be held in
Charlotte, North Carolina 4-7 November 2012.  In order to make this
another great gathering for planetary scientists, we encourage you to
consider submitting a technical session proposal for the meeting. If
there is a particular topic that you would like to see included in
the annual meeting program, and that you think would appeal to your
colleagues, please propose a session!  Here is the website:

http://gsa.confex.com/gsa/2012AM/TopicalRequirements.epl

The deadline for proposing a technical session is next Tuesday,
January 10 (same day as LPSC abstracts).  To ensure that session
proposals for PGD don't get overlooked in the rush to get those
abstracts submitted, please consider submitting a session proposal
sooner rather than later!  Thank you. We look forward to receiving
your session proposals and seeing you in Charlotte next November!

Sincerely,

Simon Kattenhorn

[NASA] POSTDOCTORAL FELLOWSHIPS

The NASA Postdoctoral Program (NPP) offers scientists and engineers 
unique opportunities to conduct research at NASA Centers. Each NPP 
fellowship opportunity is designed to advance NASA research in a 
specific project related to space science, earth science, aeronautics, 
space operations, exploration systems, lunar science, or astrobiology.

Applicants must have a Ph.D. or equivalent degree in hand before 
beginning the fellowship, but may apply while completing the degree 
requirements. U. S. citizens, Lawful Permanent Residents, and foreign 
nationals eligible for J-1 status as a Research Scholar may apply. An 
H-1B Visa status is not acceptable because the NPP is not an employment 
program.

Stipends for Postdoctoral Fellows start at $50,000 per year, with 
moderate supplements for high cost-of-living areas and for certain 
academic specialties. Funds are available for relocation expenses, 
up to a specified limit, and health insurance is available through the 
program. Fellows also receive $8,000 per appointment year to support 
travel to conferences, meetings, and other activities that directly 
support their research.

Applications are accepted three times each year: March 1, July 1, 
and November 1.

Questions may be submitted by e-mail to nasapostdoc@orau.org

European Geosciences Union General Assembly 2012 (GM10.1) in Vienna, 
Austria on the 22-27th April. The abstract deadline is the 
17th January.

Abstracts are welcomed that describe new advances in the study of 
planetary landscapes and processes, including all solid-surface 
planetary bodies. Terrestrial studies (either in the field or 
laboratory) aimed at understanding other planetary bodies are also 
encouraged. Our invited speakers include Dr. Ernst Hauber (DLR) and 
Prof. James Head (Brown University), who will be presenting their 
Earth analogue work.

Please note there is an Abstract Processing Charge of 40 Euros per
