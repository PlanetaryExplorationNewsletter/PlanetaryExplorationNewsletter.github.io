VOLCANO-LITHOSPHERE INTERACTIONS ON THE TERRESTRIAL PLANETS POST-
DOCTORAL FELLOWSHIP: LUNAR AND PLANETARY INSTITUTE

The Universities Space Research Association - Houston invites 
applications for a postdoctoral fellowship in geophysical studies of 
the growth/evolution of large volcanic edifices and provinces on the 
terrestrial planets.

The candidate will work with Dr. Patrick McGovern exploring mechanical
interactions between intrusive and extrusive volcanic edifice growth,
lithospheric flexural response, and magma ascent, using numerical
modeling techniques, including Finite Element (FEM) and Distinct 
Element (DEM) Methods. Research will also entail analysis of imagery, 
topography, gravity, and spectral datasets for large planetary 
volcanoes in order to constrain the modeling efforts. Potential 
bodies of interest include Venus, Io, the Moon, Earth, and Mars.

Requirements are a recent Ph.D. in geophysics or geology. Experience 
quantitative modeling of geophysical, geological, or magmatic processes 
with advanced codes as COMSOL Multiphysics (FEM) and PFC (DEM).  
Programming languages, MATLAB or FORTRAN 95 desirable. The position 
is two years with a possible extension to three years.

Send letter of interest, curriculum vita with a list of relevant 
publications, brief statement of research interests, and three 
references to resume@lpi.usra.edu. Further information may be found 
at:

http://www.lpi.usra.edu

PLANETARY GEOPHYSICS POSTDOCTORAL FELLOWSHIP

The Universities Space Research Association's Lunar and Planetary 
Institute (LPI), in Houston Texas, invites applications for a post-
doctoral fellowship in planetary geophysics.
 
The successful candidate will work with Dr. Walter Kiefer on a NASA-
funded project studying the nature of mantle convection on Mars and 
its effects on the thermal evolution and volcanic history of the 
planet. The candidate will also have the opportunity to conduct 
research in planetary geophysics of his or her own choosing.
 
The position requires a Ph.D. in Planetary Science or Geophysics with 
experience in computer programming and numerical modeling methods, 
particularly finite elements. Experience with parallel computing in a 
Linux environment will be an asset. The position will be offered for an 
initial period of two years with a possible extension to a maximum of 
three years.
 
Applicants should send a letter of interest, a curriculum vita listing 
relevant publications, a brief (maximum three pages) statement of 
research interests, and a list of three references to:
resume@lpi.usra.edu.  

Review of candidates will begin on March 15, 2012, with a hiring 
decision as soon as possible thereafter.  Further information about LPI 
can be found at www.lpi.usra.edu.

ESA POSTDOCTORAL FELLOWSHIPS IN SPACE SCIENCE

Applications are now solicited for European Space Agency fellowships in 
space science to begin in the fall of 2013. Preference will be given to 
applications submitted by candidates within five years of receiving 
their PhD. Candidates not holding a PhD yet are encouraged to apply, 
but they must provide evidence of receiving their degree before 
starting the fellowship.

Areas of research include planetary science, astronomy and 
astrophysics, solar and solar-terrestrial science, plasma physics and 
fundamental physics. The fellowships have a duration of two years and 
are tenable at the European Space Research and Technology Centre 
(ESTEC) in Noordwijk, Netherlands, or at the European Space Astronomy 
Centre (ESAC) in Villafranca del Castillo, near Madrid, Spain.

The deadline for applications is 1 October 2012.

More information on the ESA Research Fellowship program in Space
Science, on the conditions and eligibility, as well as the application
form can be found on the world-wide web at this address:

NASA POSTDOCTORAL FELLOWSHIPS

The NASA Postdoctoral Program (NPP) offers scientists and engineers 
unique opportunities to conduct research at NASA Centers. Each NPP 
fellowship opportunity is designed to advance NASA research in a 
specific project related to space science, earth science, aeronautics, 
exploration systems, lunar science, astrobiology, or astrophysics.

Applicants must have a Ph.D. or equivalent degree in hand before 
beginning the fellowship, but may apply while completing the degree 
requirements. U. S. citizens, Lawful Permanent Residents, and foreign 
nationals eligible for J-1 status as a Research Scholar may apply.

Stipends start at $50,000 per year, with supplements for high cost-
of-living areas and for certain academic specialties. Financial 
assistance is available for relocation and health insurance, and 
$8,000 per year is provided for professional travel.

Applications are accepted three times each year: March 1, July 1, 
and November 1.

[NASA] SCIENCE MISSION DIRECTORATE (SMD) ANNOUNCEMENTS

1. SMD has updated the ROSES Summary of Solicitation to include 
reference to a new SARA FAQ on how ROSES proposals and awards are 
affected by Public Law 112-55 Section 539(a), which restricts NASA's 
use of funds for projects involving the People's Republic of China. 
The new FAQ can be found by going to the normal ROSES FAQ page at:

http://science.nasa.gov/researchers/sara/faqs/#1 

and following the link or by going directly to: 

http://science.nasa.gov/researchers/sara/faqs/prc-faq-roses-2012/

2. SMD has created a new web page on SARA through which we are 
soliciting volunteer reviewers for upcoming reviews. By this method 
volunteers can sign up not just for a review, but can indicate a panel 
or focus area. We are currently seeking panelists and mail-in reviewers 
for Laboratory Analysis of Returned Samples, Exobiology (Part I), and

AGU FALL 2012 SESSION: P34. WHAT LURKS IN THE MARTIAN ROCKS AND SOIL? 
INVESTIGATIONS OF SULFATES, PHOSPHATES, AND PERCHLORATES

Sulfates, phosphates, and perchlorates have been found on Mars from 
orbit and/or from surface missions.  Identification of these minerals 
(suites) can enable constraints on the Martian geochemical 
environments.  This session will generate a discussion regarding the 
conditions for the formation of these minerals on Mars, and methods for 
identifying their geological environments and related fluid chemistry.  
Abstracts describing discoveries of sulfates, phosphates, or 
perchlorates from surface missions and orbital spacecraft data, and 
those covering laboratory analyses and thermodynamic modeling relating 
to the hydration state of these minerals and their stability on Mars 
are welcome. 

Abstract deadline:  August 8, 2012,  23:59ET/3:59+1 GMT
