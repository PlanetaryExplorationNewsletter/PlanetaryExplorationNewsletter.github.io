EDITORIAL: NASA PLANETARY SCIENCE DIVISION RESEARCH AND ANALYSIS 
PROGRAMS - AN ASSESSMENT

Mark V. Sykes
Planetary Science Institute

Despite high priority in the recent Planetary Decadal Survey and prior
NRC reports, NASA Planetary Science Division Research and Analysis 
programs continue to suffer from uncertain budgets and low selection 
rates, undermining US solar system exploration. I have written a 
report, with the above title, on the budget history and status of these
programs, which has been posted at:

http://planetarypolicy.org/RA_REPORT_DEC12/NASA_PSD_RA_Report.pdf

with supporting documentation at:

http://planetarypolicy.org/RA_REPORT_DEC12/RA_budget_history_03_13.xlsx
http://planetarypolicy.org/RA_REPORT_DEC12/psd_grant_stats.xlsx

Recommendations are made for the priority of funding stability and 
growth, the communication of annual budgets to program officers at the 
beginning of each fiscal year, and an ongoing assessment of activities 
needed to support PSD strategic goals in a process that is open and 
transparent.

[PDS] MARS RECONNAISSANCE ORBITER DATA RELEASE 23

The NASA Planetary Data System (PDS) is pleased to announce a new 
delivery of Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO) data for the following 
instruments: CRISM, CTX, HiRISE, MARCI, MCS, RSS, SHARAD and SPICE.
CRISM data will be available in approximately one week. There will be 
no Derived Gravity data for this release.

The PS2.4 session will address the latest results on the interior, 
surface, atmosphere and ionosphere of Mars from recent and ongoing Mars 
missions.

EGU 2013, PLANETARY PLASMA PHYSICS SESSION

We invite you to submit an abstract to the following session during the 
next EGU in Vienna, Austria (7-12 April 2013).

PS5.1: Planetary Plasma Physics, including electrodynamics of induced 
magnetospheres

The emphasis of the session is on all aspects of planetary plasma 
physics and interactions in the Solar System, including:
(a) magnetospheres, ionospheres, auroras
(b) the solar wind interaction with planets, moons, asteroids and 
comets
(c) plasma interactions with exospheres, dust and surfaces (e.g. at 
Mercury, Europa, Ganymede, our Moon, etc.)
(d) intercomparisons of planetary environments

Contributions are welcome which address previous (e.g. CHANDRAYAAN-1, 
KAGUYA), present (e.g. CASSINI, MARS EXPRESS, VENUS EXPRESS, ROSETTA, 
MESSENGER, CHANG'E 2), forthcoming (e.g. BEPI COLOMBO) and planned 
(e.g., JUICE) observations from space. Analyses of ground-based 
observations of neutral and ionized environments are welcome. 
Theoretical modelling and simulations are also strongly encouraged, 
both in themselves and as a basis for intercomparisons and 
interpretation of measurements. Laboratory studies on planetary 
analogues aiming to simulate the surface-plasma interaction are 
considered as well.

The deadline for the reception of abstracts is: 9 January 2013

Conveners: P. Garnier, A. Milillo, I. Dandouras

EGU 2013, DIGITAL LANDSCAPES SESSION

We are pleased to announce GM 2.1 the 'Digital Landscapes' session at 
EGU2013 (Vienna, 8-12 April 2013). Following a successful session last 
year, we look forward to seeing you at another dynamic and diverse 
session full of interesting ideas.

GM 2.1 Digital Landscapes: Quantitative Interrogation and Use to 
Examine Geomorphic Processes

This inter-disciplinary session focuses on exciting quantitative uses 
of digital landscapes (DEM, DTM, DSM or point-cloud) to understand how 
the Earth's surface is shaped.  Global (e.g. ASTER) to high-resolution 
(e.g. laser scanning, structure-through-motion) data sets are welcomed 
as we believe developments will come through cross-fertilization of 
best practice and interesting method of analysis. Possibilities (e.g., 
repeat surveys, real-time observation), problems (e.g. awkward case 
studies), solutions and interesting geomorphic uses from archaeology to 
volcano formation are encouraged.

Deadline for Receipt of Abstracts: 9 January 2013

14TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ELECTROMAGNETIC AND LIGHT SCATTERING,
ELS-XIV

Lille, France, June 17 - 21, 2013

http://www-loa.univ-lille1.fr/ELS-XIV

ELS-XIV is built on the remarkable success of the previous ELS 
conferences that gathered scientists from different fields that 
involved remote sensing of dust, aerosols, and particulate media. The 
main objective of the conference is to bring together scientists and 
engineers studying various aspects of light scattering and to provide a 
relaxed atmosphere for in-depth discussions of theoretical advances, 
measurements, and applications.

The specific topics that will be covered include (but are not limited 
to) the following:

- new theoretical developments and numerical simulations of light 
scattering by nonspherical and morphologically complex particles and 
particle groups
- laboratory and field experiments in light scattering by natural and 
artificial particles
- single and multiple light scattering by cloud and aerosol particles 
in the terrestrial atmosphere
- single and multiple scattering of light in various astrophysical 
objects
- light scattering in densely packed particulate media
- near-field and coherent effects in light scattering
- applications of light scattering in remote sensing, particle 
detection, laboratory and field particle characterization

One-page abstracts should be submitted to by 15 December 2012 to 
ELS2013@univ-lille1.fr (please, check the conference website for 
possible deadline extension).

PLANETARY GRADUATE PROGRAM CLEARINGHOUSE

Do you advise undergraduates on where to apply to grad school? Do you 
have trouble remembering all the programs and keeping up to date? Do 
you want to get the word out on your own graduate program? The DPS 
Education & Public Outreach Subcommittee has assembled a listing of 68 
institutions offering graduate degrees with a focus on planetary 
science:

http://dps.aas.org/education/graduate-schools

So, please send this link to students you mentor and mailing lists of 
majors. We especially want the webpage to be up-to-date and accurate, 
so please also send it to your own graduate admissions liaisons for 
updates and corrections. Application deadlines are imminent, so please 
help get the word out!

NEW BOOK - IMPACT CRATERING: PROCESSES AND PRODUCTS

It is my pleasure to announce the publication of a new book entitled 
"Impact Cratering: Processes and Products", published by 
Wiley-Blackwell: 

http://ca.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle
/productCd-140519829X,descCd-tableOfContents.html 

This book contains a dedication to Betty Pierazzo, my co-editor, who 
sadly passed away before this project was completed.

This book comprises 20 peer-reviewed chapters covering broad aspects of 
the impact cratering process. It introduces readers to the threat and 
nature of impactors, the impact cratering process, the products, and 
the effects - both destructive and beneficial. A series of chapters on 
the various techniques used to study impact craters provide a 
foundation for anyone studying impacts.

In addition to the book - available in both print and ebook form 
- all figures from the book are available as powerpoint files from a 
companion website, hopefully providing a valuable teaching resource:
