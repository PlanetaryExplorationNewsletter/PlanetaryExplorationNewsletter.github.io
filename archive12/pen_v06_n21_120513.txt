[NASA] PGG PROPOSAL DUE DATE CHANGED TO JULY 2, 2012

The Planetary Geology and Geophysics (PGG) program supports
scientific investigations of planetary surfaces and interiors,
satellites (including the Moon), satellite and ring systems, and
smaller Solar System bodies, such as asteroids and comets. The
goals of the PGG program are to foster the synthesis, analysis,
and comparative study of data that will improve the understanding
of the extent and influence of planetary geological and geophysical
processes on the bodies of the Solar System.

The due date for proposals to this program has been delayed to
July 2, 2012, to permit proposers who recently received evaluations
of their PGG ROSES 2011 proposals additional time to prepare 
proposals. 

[Note: "evaluations" corrects "notification of the decision" that
appeared in the ROSES Amendment, per Max Bernstein (SARA). ]

GSA SESSION ON GULLIES IN THE LANDSCAPE: ABSTRACTS INVITED

Dear colleagues,

Paul Bierman and I are convening a session (T23) at the GSA Annual 
Meeting in Charlotte in November on gully erosion.

This session addresses all aspects of gullying (on Earth or elsewhere 
in the Solar System), including field and remote-sensing studies of 
gully occurrence, mechanics of gully formation, environmental and 
sedimentological consequences, engineering challenges, and the relative 
roles of humans and natural forcing factors.

http://www.geosociety.org/meetings/2012/sessions/topical.asp

Abstracts on any aspect of gully formation are welcome.

Due date: August 14, 2012

Ronadh Cox

EPSC SESSION GP4: MOON-MAGNETOSPHERE INTERACTIONS AT JUPITER AND SATURN

Dear Colleagues:

We are organizing a session at this year's EPSC meeting titled 
"Moon-Magnetosphere Interactions at Jupiter and Saturn (GP4)."

The meeting will take place in Madrid, Sept. 23-28, 2012.

Three speakers (Tim Cassidy, Sven Simon, and Ben Teolis) will give 
review-style talks related to this subject and their current research.

We think this will be an exciting session featuring data and modeling 
for both giant planet systems.

We encourage you to contribute an abstract. The deadline for doing so 
is Wednesday May 23, 2012.

Best wishes,

Chris Paranicas (chris.paranicas@jhuapl.edu) 
Amanda Hendrix (arh@jpl.nasa.gov)

DAP-2012 MEETING

The "Dust, Atmosphere and Plasma: Moon and Small Bodies" meeting will 
take place on June 6-8, 2012, in Boulder Colorado. The program is now 
available at:
