PROFESSORSHIP IN PLANETARY REMOTE SENSING AND RESOURCE GEOSCIENCE

The School of Engineering and Science at Jacobs University Bremen 
invites applications for a professorship in the field of Earth and 
Planetary Sciences with a focus on planetary remote sensing, resource 
characterization, and/or resource exploration. Applicants should be 
experienced in the application of geophysical methods such as 
potential field analysis, satellite image interpretation and mapping, 
electromagnetic sounding methods and remote sensing to bridge between 
resource geoscience and planetary sciences. Within the undergraduate 
program Earth and Space Sciences, the successful candidate will 
contribute to education in the field of Geophysics and Planetary 
Sciences. Participation in curricula, organizational, outreach and 
communication activities is expected.

Applications should include a single PDF attachment containing a 
letter of application, curriculum vitae, publications list, 
statements of research and teaching, and the names and addresses 
including e-mail of at least three potential referees.

FACULTY POSITION IN PLANETARY AND SPACE SCIENCE

The School of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences at Georgia Tech invites 
applications for a tenure-track faculty position in the areas of 
Planetary and Space Sciences. We are seeking candidates interested in 
a range of topics that complement our existing strengths: space

[NASA] SOLAR SYSTEM EXPLORATION AT 50 (SSE@50) SPECIAL EVENT NOTICE AND 
SYMPOSIUM

October 24-26, 2012 - Washington DC area.

Over the next year NASA and affiliates will be celebrating 50 years 
of Solar System Exploration. Two upcoming events are available, free, 
on a first come basis, but registration is required. Panelists 
speaking at the public event and symposium include participants 
who were "there at the creation," current scientists and researchers, 
historians and analysts from around the world. For the symposium, a 
select collection of the papers will be published as a book and live
webcast.
 
Advance registration is required, but the events are free to 
registrants.

Registration deadline: October 19, 2012. Go to:

https://www.signup4.net/public/ap.aspx?EID=SSE510E&OID=50

SPECIAL ISSUE OF ICARUS FOR THE THIRD INTERNATIONAL PLANETARY DUNES 
WORKSHOP
 
The Third International Planetary Dunes Workshop took place 
June 12-15, 2012, in Flagstaff, Arizona (see Titus et al., EOS, 
v. 93, n. 38, p. 367, Sept. 12, 2012). More than 50 researchers and 
students participated in 2.5 days of presentations and lively 
discussion. The workshop was dedicated to Ronald Greeley, whose 
distinguished career included many important contributions to aeolian 
research for features on Earth and the planets.
 
A special issue of Icarus will provide a mechanism for wide 
dissemination of results presented at the workshop, as well as for 
other recent research related to aeolian studies of planetary surfaces. 
Manuscripts on any topic within planetary aeolian studies are 
solicited, but those focusing on planetary dune systems are 
particularly encouraged. Reports on terrestrial analog studies are very 
appropriate this issue, but these manuscripts should include discussion 
of how the results can be reasonably extended to the analysis of 
features in planetary environments. As an indication of interest, 
please send an e-mail that includes a working title, proposed author 
list, and two-sentence description of the manuscript to 
zimbelmanj@si.edu by October 26, 2012.
 
Final manuscript submission: February 1, 2013.

VENUS EXPLORATION ANALYSIS GROUP (VEXAG) SOLICITS YOUR INPUT

One of the primary goals of the 13-15 November Venus Exploration
Analysis Group (VEXAG) meeting is to update the Goals, Objectives and
Investigations for Venus Exploration. On the eve of the decade served
by the new NRC Planetary Decadal Survey, now seems an appropriate time
to revisit these to ensure that VEXAG priorities reflect advances in 
understanding that have been made possible by the Venus Express 
mission.

To that end, the VEXAG executive committee is interested in receiving
feedback from the community prior to November meeting. Please read the
document posted at:

http://www.lpi.usra.edu/vexag/VenusExploreGoalsObjectives_03_12.pdf

It is hoped that the document reflects the views of the international 
Venus community and that it can be useful for galvanizing support 
for future exploration as in international coordinated effort.

Commets regarding specific investigations, and the overall themes 
for Goals and Objectives, are welcome. Please send comments to:
Lori Glaze (Lori.S.Glaze@nasa.gov) by COB Friday, 26 October 2012. 
Comments will be incorporated into a draft document for discussion 
and approval at the November 2012 meeting. You can participate in 
person, or via WebEx, but please register and indicate your 
participation mode!

INVESTING IN AMERICA'S TECHNOLOGY FUTURE: NASA SEEKS SPACE TECHNOLOGY 
RESEARCH FELLOWSHIP APPLICANTS

NASA is seeking applications from graduate students for the agency's 
Space Technology Research Fellowships. Applications will be accepted 
from students pursuing or planning to pursue master's or doctoral 
degrees in relevant space technology disciplines at accredited U.S. 
universities. The fellowship awards, worth as much as $68,000 per 
year, will coincide with the start of the fall 2013 term.

The fellowships will sponsor U.S. graduate student researchers who
show significant potential to contribute to NASA's strategic space
technology objectives through their studies. 

"NASA's Space Technology Program is building, testing and flying the
technologies required for NASA's missions of tomorrow. With new 
technologies and innovation, astronauts will be able to travel safely 
beyond low Earth orbit and new science missions will make amazing 
discoveries about our universe. These fellowships will help create 
the next generation of highly skilled workers needed for NASA's and 
our nation's future, while motivating careers in science and 
technology that will lead to  sustainable, high-tech jobs while 
America out-innovates the world." - Michael Gazarik

FAMELAB ASTROBIOLOGY

Calling All Early Career Scientists!  
Passionate About Science?  
Love To Communicate?

You are wholeheartedly invited to participate in FameLab: Exploring 
Earth and Beyond!

FameLab is something like American Idol for scientists... Sponsored by 
NASA and National Geographic, it's a fun-filled day of competition, 
coaching, and camaraderie that's all about science communication!  
At regional heats held across the US over the next 18 months-starting 
with the AGU Fall meeting in December-early career scientists craft a 
3-minute, powerpoint-free talk on their research and deliver it in a 
supportive environment to judges who give only constructive feedback.  
The heart of the whole thing is a workshop to help participants 
enrich their skills. So unlike American Idol, everyone wins!

Even if you're not planning to attend AGU, you're welcome to 
participate...we'll also be announcing future competitions as they 
emerge in the coming months. Register or sign up for our mailing list 
to stay in the loop:
