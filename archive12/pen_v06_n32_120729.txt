AGU FALL 2012 SPECIAL SESSION P006. CRATERING PROCESSES THROUGHOUT THE 
SOLAR SYSTEM

Dear colleagues,

We're happy to announce a cratering session at the 2012 AGU fall 
meeting:

http://fallmeeting.agu.org/2012/session-search/single/
cratering-processes-throughout-the-solar-system/

Abstract:
Impact cratering on planetary and asteroidal surfaces provides a 
window into the physics of hypervelocity impact. In addition to the 
basic physics questions surrounding the formation of impact features 
on planetary surfaces, detailed knowledge of the mechanics of crater 
formation is essential to unraveling the impact history of cratered 
bodies. This session investigates cratering on all length scales, 
ranging from micrometeoroid impacts through multi-kilometer 
planetary features. Spacecraft observations, laboratory experiments, 
and computational studies investigating features of hypervelocity 
impacts are encouraged.

The 2012 AGU fall meeting is December 3-7 in San Francisco, CA, 
and the deadline for submission is August 8th at 23:59ET.  
Abstracts can be submitted at:

http://agu-fm12.abstractcentral.com/ 

We look forward to your submissions and don't hesitate to contact 
us if you have any questions.

AGU FALL 2012 SPECIAL SESSION P011. LABORATORY INVESTIGATIONS 
SUPPORTING ANALYSIS OF DATASETS FROM MARS, THE MOON, AND OTHER 
PLANETARY BODIES

Planetary missions over the past decade have gathered a wealth of data, 
including spectral (e.g., TES, OMEGA, CRISM, M3), thermophysical (e.g., 
Diviner, THEMIS), and geochemical/mineralogical (e.g., GRS, APXS, MB,
CheMin, ChemCam, SAM). Rigorous laboratory investigations are required 
for instrument calibration and refinement of data interpretation. This 
session will focus on measurements/experiments that relate to 
interpretation of remote sensing or in situ data from planetary 
bodies. Studies that utilize multiple methods/datasets, analog 
materials, and advance quantitative compositional analyses of orbital 
data or the interpretation of MSL/MER instrument data are especially
encouraged.

Abstract deadline: August 8th

AGU FALL 2012 SPECIAL SESSION P012. LUNAR SCIENCE IN THE WAKE OF 
HUMAN EXPLORATION: FOUR DECADES OF SAMPLES AND SURFACE DATA

In December 1972 Apollo 17 completed the first era of human exploration 
of the Moon. In the 40 years since this event our understanding of the 
Moon and its history have evolved as a result of analysis of lunar 
samples, surface experiments, and recent orbital missions. Building 
upon the solid foundation provided by the Apollo-era exploration and 
science results, new views of the Moon have flourished in the past 
decade due to improved analytical techniques and enhanced 
instrumentation. This session will highlight lessons from the Apollo 
exploration of the Moon as well as what has been learned over the 
past 40 years, focusing on the latest analysis of samples and results 
from recent and ongoing orbital missions.

AGU FALL 2012 SPECIAL SESSION P025. RECENT ADVANCES IN LUNAR SCIENCE: 
OF, ON AND FROM THE MOON

This session will feature science reports focused on lunar science 
including geology/geochemistry, impact cratering, lunar formation 
and solar system dynamics, space plasma/exosphere and surface 
interactions, and volatile characterization as well as the unique 
astronomy and cosmology enabled by the radio-quiet far side of the 
Moon.

AGU FALL 2012 SESSION P032. USING NUMERICAL MODELS TO UNDERSTAND THE 
VENUS ATMOSPHERE AND SURFACE

Numerical models are essential tools used to integrate the 
increasingly complex observations of the Venus atmosphere and surface 
into self-consistent scientific hypotheses about the structure, 
microphysics, and circulation of the Venus atmosphere. The abundance 
of observations from Venus Express and the 2012 transit presents a 
unique opportunity to discuss the best implementations and uses of 
these models.

Presentations will discuss observation models that are used in 
retrieval/inversion of observations of the atmosphere and surface 
(e.g., composition retrieval), and models that simulate physical 
processes driving the thermal structure, composition, and circulation
of the atmosphere (e.g., microphysics models, GCMs).

AGU FALL 2012 SESSION P034. WHAT LURKS IN THE MARTIAN ROCKS AND SOIL?
INVESTIGATIONS OF SULFATES, PHOSPHATES, AND PERCHLORATES

Sulfates, phosphates, and perchlorates have been found on Mars from
orbit and/or from surface missions. Identification of these minerals
(suites) can enable constraints on the Martian geochemical
environments. This session will generate a discussion regarding the
conditions for the formation of these minerals on Mars, and methods for
identifying their geological environments and related fluid chemistry.  
Abstracts describing discoveries of sulfates, phosphates, or
perchlorates from surface missions and orbital spacecraft data, and
those covering laboratory analyses and thermodynamic modeling relating
to the hydration state of these minerals and their stability on Mars
are welcome.

interactions between intrusive and extrusive volcanic edifice growth, 
lithospheric flexural response, and magma ascent, using numerical 
modeling techniques, including Finite Element (FEM) and Distinct 
Element (DEM) Methods. Research will also entail analysis of imagery,
topography, gravity, and spectral datasets for large planetary 
volcanoes in order to constrain the modeling efforts. Potential 
bodies of interest include Venus, Io, the Moon, Earth, and Mars.

Requirements are a recent Ph.D. in geophysics or geology. Experience 
quantitative modeling of geophysical, geological, or magmatic 
processes with advanced codes as COMSOL Multiphysics (FEM) and PFC

OSIRIS-REx MISSION TEAM IMAGE PROCESSING SCIENTIST

The University of Arizona's Lunar and Planetary Laboratory is leading 
the OSIRIS-REx mission to a primitive asteroid. Images from the 
spacecraft's cameras will be critical to many elements of the mission, 
including optical navigation, global mapping to secure a shape model 
to define a reference coordinate system, the search for valid and 
viable sampling sites, monitoring of the sample acquisition process 
and the search for any satellites and dust plumes around the asteroid. 
We seek a full-time staff scientist who will help define and create 
the image processing requirements and algorithms needed to achieve 
this goal. During asteroid proximity operations, they will use their 
knowledge of image processing and tools to manage routine pipeline 
processing of returned images, and the creation of ad-hoc imaging 
products. They will also support the creation of image data products 
to support the selection of a sampling site.

We are searching for a PhD in an appropriate field with 3-4 years of
experience OR a bachelors or higher degree in an appropriate field 
and 10 years of experience.
