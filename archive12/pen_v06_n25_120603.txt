JOHN "JACK" MCCAULEY, 1932-2012

An eminent planetary scientist, John "Jack" McCauley, and a former 
chief and colleague at USGS/Astrogeology has passed away. Jack was a 
brilliant and productive field geologist and mapper, and he had many 
significant contributions in geologic studies of the Sahara & Namib 
deserts and the Moon, Mercury and Mars. A very nice obituary can be 
found online:

[NASA] JUPITER ICY MOONS EXPLORER PARTICIPATION OPPORTUNITIES 

On May 2, 2012, ESA selected the Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer (JUICE) 
as the first Large-class mission in the Cosmic Vision plan. The JUICE 
mission will investigate Jupiter and its icy moons, completing its 
mission by orbiting Ganymede. The mission is planned for launch in 
2022.  NASA has offered to contribute a combination of US 
instrument(s), instrument component(s) for European-led instrument(s), 
and/or Co-Investigators on European-led instruments, all to total not 
more than $100M life cycle cost.  

We expect 55% of this funding will be used during the instrument 
development phases and the remaining 45% during operations (cruise and 
prime science mission). Given the duration of cruise, lean focused 
science teams will be a necessity.  

JUICE instruments are planned to be solicited via a competitive 
Announcement of Opportunity issued by ESA; a corresponding amendment to 
SALMON will be released by NASA. Release of these documents is planned 
for late June 2012. 
 
Scientific objectives, model payload and mission profile can be found 
in the JUICE Assessment Study Report (Yellow Book) at:

A Federal Business Opportunity (FBO) announcement will be available 
within the next two weeks.

MER1/B. It includes data from the following instruments:   

APXS  
HAZCAM  
NAVCAM  
MI  
MOESSBAUER (EDRs)
PANCAM  
RAT
Rover Motion Counter
SPICE  

There are no Mini-TES, Moessbauer RDRs, or Radio Science data 
in this release.

NASA POSTDOCTORAL FELLOWSHIPS

The NASA Postdoctoral Program (NPP) offers scientists and engineers 
unique opportunities to conduct research at NASA Centers. Each NPP 
fellowship opportunity is designed to advance NASA research in a 
specific project related to space science, earth science, aeronautics, 
exploration systems, lunar science, astrobiology, or astrophysics.

Applicants must have a Ph.D. or equivalent degree in hand before 
beginning the fellowship, but may apply while completing the degree 
requirements. U. S. citizens, Lawful Permanent Residents, and foreign 
nationals eligible for J-1 status as a Research Scholar may apply.

Stipends start at $50,000 per year, with supplements for high 
cost-of-living areas and for certain academic specialties. Financial 
assistance is available for relocation and health insurance, and 
$8,000 per year is provided for professional travel.

Applications are accepted three times each year: March 1, July 1, and 
November 1.

[NASA] RESEARCH POSITION AT GSFC

The Planetary Magnetospheres Laboratory at NASA Goddard Space Flight
Center is seeking a researcher to provide expertise in new capabilities 
for modeling the interactions between the solar wind and the Moon and 
other near-airless bodies, transport and trapping of lunar volatiles, 
volatile sources and losses, and plasma/surface interactions. In 
addition to research, you will provide expertise in associated 
planetary and exploration robotic missions and instrument development 
projects.  You will participate in preliminary and critical design 
reviews and develop and defend instrument and mission requirements. You 
will be called on to demonstrate strong teaming capability applied to 
the solution of relevant problems. Missions that you could support 
include the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) and future lunar and 
planetary projects of the SSED.

A PhD in a relevant field of Physics or Astronomy is preferred. 
Candidates must have experience modeling solar wind/plasma interactions 
with the surface and near surface environments of the Moon and other 
solar system bodies. Salary will be commensurate with experience and 
qualifications.  U.S. citizenship required. To view the full vacancy 
announcement go to:
