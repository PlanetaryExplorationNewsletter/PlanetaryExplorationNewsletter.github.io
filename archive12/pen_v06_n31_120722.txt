AGU FALL 2012 SPECIAL SESSION P03. AIRLESS BODY PETROLOGY THROUGH 
SAMPLES AND REMOTE SENSING: DIVERSE APPROACHES TO COMMON PROBLEMS

This interdisciplinary session (San Francisco, CA, December 3-7, 2012)
is sponsored by the Planetary Sciences section and co-sponsored by the 
Volcanology-Geochemistry-Petrology (VGP) section, and emphasizes both 
remote sensing and sample-based investigations of airless body 
petrology.

Numerous recent and current missions are providing planetary scientists 
with remote sensing data of unprecedented quality and volume. 
Concurrently, improvements in laboratory instrumentation are enabling 
new fundamental discoveries from analysis of returned samples and 
meteorites. Communication between both fields is crucial for addressing 
broad planetary science questions and maximizing the science return of 
current and future planetary exploration. This session will further 
research in planetary petrology by encouraging such synergistic research 
through contributions from remote sensing and sample-based analyses. 
Submissions are welcomed for studies of any airless body.

Please consider submitting an abstract for this session.  Visit: 

http://fallmeeting.agu.org/2012/ 

for meeting information and abstract submission (submission deadline is 
August 8, 2012).

Invited Speakers: 
Hap McSween, Jeff Taylor, Juliane Gross, Tim McCoy (tentative)

Conveners: 
Peter Isaacson, Rachel Klima, Rhiannon Mayne
We look forward to seeing you in San Francisco.

AGU FALL 2012 SPECIAL SESSION P04. ATMOSPHERE OF MARS: NEW FINDINGS 
FROM MODELING AND OBSERVATIONS

Mars Science Laboratory's rover is currently on its way to Mars and 
will be landing as you prepare to submit an abstract to this session. 
This rover will be able to assess atmospheric meteorological and 
chemical conditions at its landing site. This is just one of many 
current and future missions that are/will be collecting various 
information about the atmosphere of Mars. Parallel to these missions 
there is an outstanding amount of research work to analyze data and 
provide predictions and back-up to the missions. We invite you to 
submit an abstract of your work to this session which is open to all 
research topics related to the atmosphere of Mars.

AGU FALL 2012 SESSION: P011. LABORATORY INVESTIGATIONS SUPPORTING 
ANALYSIS OF DATASETS FROM MARS, THE MOON, AND OTHER PLANETARY BODIES

Planetary missions over the past decade have gathered a wealth of data, 
including spectral (e.g. TES, OMEGA, CRISM, M3), thermophysical (e.g. 
Diviner, THEMIS), and geochemical/mineralogical (e.g. GRS, APXS, MB, 
CheMin, ChemCam, SAM). Rigorous laboratory investigations are required 
for instrument calibration and refinement of data interpretation. This 
session will focus on measurements/experiments that relate to 
interpretation of remote sensing or in situ data from planetary 
bodies. Studies that utilize multiple methods/datasets, analog 
materials, and advance quantitative compositional analyses of orbital 
data or the interpretation of MSL/MER instrument data are especially 
encouraged.

This session is co-sponsored by MSA.

Abstract deadline: August 8th

AGU FALL 2012 SPECIAL SESSION P021: PLANETARY SURFACES IN MOTION

With the advent of high spatial resolution and increasing temporal 
baselines, spacecraft observations have documented surface changes on 
planetary bodies at decadal, annual, and shorter timescales. These 
data provide fundamental insight into active surface changes, which 
vary in type, mode, and magnitude across the Solar System, and provide 
motivation for model, terrestrial analog, and laboratory studies that 
seek to better understand underlying physical mechanisms and relevant 
environment conditions. This session seeks abstracts focused on 
observations and modeling of surface processes, including fluvial, 
volcanic, mass wasting, aeolian and other agents that cause changes 
that can be monitored by spacecraft. Laboratory and field analog 
studies are also welcome.

AGU FALL 2012 SPECIAL SESSION P33. USING TOPOGRAPHY TO INVESTIGATE THE 
EVOLUTION OF SOLAR SYSTEM BODIES
 
Spacecraft data have enabled the surface topography of many solar 
system bodies to be determined. These data provide insight into near-
surface processes and properties that exist over the visible history 
of a body, on global and local scales. We invite abstracts on any 
topic in which topography plays a role. These may describe theoretical 
investigations, laboratory studies or data analysis of anybody in the 
solar system and can include (but are not limited to): topographic 
measurements that are indicative of the types of surface terrain or 
environments present; processes that create or erase/erode surface 
topography at any scale; and subsurface processes that are expressed 
by surface topography.

AGU FALL 2012 SESSION: P34. WHAT LURKS IN THE MARTIAN ROCKS AND SOIL? 
INVESTIGATIONS OF SULFATES, PHOSPHATES, AND PERCHLORATES

Sulfates, phosphates, and perchlorates have been found on Mars from 
orbit and/or from surface missions.  Identification of these minerals 
(suites) can enable constraints on the Martian geochemical 
environments.  This session will generate a discussion regarding the 
conditions for the formation of these minerals on Mars, and methods for 
identifying their geological environments and related fluid chemistry.  
Abstracts describing discoveries of sulfates, phosphates, or 
perchlorates from surface missions and orbital spacecraft data, and 
those covering laboratory analyses and thermodynamic modeling relating 
to the hydration state of these minerals and their stability on Mars 
are welcome.

UPDATES FOR THE 3RD CONFERENCE ON TERRESTRIAL MARS ANALOGUES

1. The deadline of the abstract submission has been postponed up to 
September 5th. We received some complaints because the deadline was in 
the middle of the European holiday season.

2. The pre-conference field trip has been re-scheduled due to the 
discontinuation by Royal Air Maroc of the Saturday flight to El Aaiun. 
The field trip starts on Saturday, October 20th, and the participants are 
expected to fly on Friday the 19th. The field trip now last 5 days.

3. The NASA Astrobiological Institute is providing travel grants to 
early career scientists.

MAUNA LOA HAWAII ANALOG SITE AVAILABLE FOR INSTRUMENT TESTING    

MMAMA Proposers: HI-SEAS (Hawaii Space Exploration Analog and 
Simulation, hi-seas.org) is a planetary surface exploration analog site 
at ~8500 feet on the Mauna Loa side of the saddle area on the Big 
Island of Hawaii, at a cinder/splatter cone next to a'a and pahoehoe 
flows, and with several lava tubes nearby. HI-SEAS is funded for its 
first season of operation by a grant from the NASA Human Research 
Program. This first mission will involve crew members living in the 
habitat for 120 days under Mars-exploration conditions.

If your instrument would benefit from testing in such a scenario, 
please contact us ( binsted@hawaii.edu ) to discuss.
