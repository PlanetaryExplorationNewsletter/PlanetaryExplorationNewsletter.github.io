EDITORIAL: SEPTEMBER 12, 1962

More than a year earlier, President Kennedy had announced before 
Congress the dramatic goal of sending an American to the Moon before 
the end of the decade. We were in a race with the Soviet Union. On 
September 12, 1962, President Kennedy gave another speech at Rice 
University, where he laid out a broader vision of national leadership, 
economic progress and sheer challenge for going to the Moon and 
exploring space. It was an exhilarating time. 

While Kennedy laid out some broader motivations, once we reached the 
Moon the American human exploration program almost collapsed. It has 
suffered ever since from a lack of long term purpose beyond 
maintaining a level of national prestige and technological capability. 
A long term purpose is not beyond our reach. It is needed to provide 
necessary focus to our human space efforts. I reach back to the public 
visions of the future in the 1960s, when we thought we all might have 
a future beyond Earth. 

I envision President Obama at Rice University on the 50th anniversary 
of Kennedy's speech, laying out a renewed vision:

DPS WORKSHOP ON PLANETARY SCIENCE ON COMMERCIAL SUBORBITAL PLATFORMS

October 14, 2012, Sunday 2:00 - 4:00 Pm
 
The most recent Planetary Sciences Decadal Survey report, Visions and 
Voyages for Planetary Science 2013-2022, highlights the potential 
advantages of using suborbital platforms for planetary science 
experiments. Suborbital vehicles not only provide platforms for 
science observations and experiments, the modest costs and development
times for suborbital missions mean they also provide excellent 
training opportunities for future spacecraft mission PIs and 
developers of spacecraft instruments. Suborbital platforms also offer 
advantages for increasing technology readiness level for flight 
experiments at a fraction of the costs of traditional orbital 
platforms.
  
Visions and Voyages discusses only balloons and rockets, but reusable
commercial suborbital vehicles also provide a new opportunity to do 
science outside the traditional and costly, low-risk approach. This 
workshop will examine how commercial suborbital vehicles can be 
exploited to use new approaches to instrumentation, spacecraft and 
mission design to answer planetary science questions.
  
Composed of talks and panel discussions, this workshop will: Present
science results and lessons learned from planetary scientists engaged 
in research using reusable commercial suborbital vehicles; Explore 
opportunities for flying and funding experiments.

VOLCANO-LITHOSPHERE INTERACTIONS ON THE TERRESTRIAL PLANETS 
POSTDOCTORAL FELLOWSHIP: LUNAR AND PLANETARY INSTITUTE

The Universities Space Research Association - Houston invites 
applications for a postdoctoral fellowship in geophysical studies of 
the growth/evolution of large volcanic edifices and provinces on the 
terrestrial planets.

The candidate will work with Dr. Patrick McGovern exploring mechanical 
interactions between intrusive and extrusive volcanic edifice growth, 
lithospheric flexural response, and magma ascent, using numerical 
modeling techniques, including Finite Element (FEM) and Distinct 
Element (DEM) Methods. Research will also entail analysis of imagery, 
topography, gravity, and spectral datasets for large planetary 
volcanoes in order to constrain the modeling efforts. Potential 
bodies of interest include Venus, Io, the Moon, Earth, and Mars.

Requirements are a recent Ph.D. in geophysics or geology. Experience 
quantitative modeling of geophysical, geological, or magmatic 
processes with advanced codes as COMSOL Multiphysics (FEM) and PFC 
(DEM). Programming languages, MATLAB or FORTRAN 95 desirable. 
The position is two years with a possible extension to three years.

Send letter of interest, curriculum vita with a list of relevant 
publications, brief statement of research interests, and three 
references to:

https://usracareers.silkroad.com/

[NASA] PDS MESSENGER RELEASE 8

The Planetary Data System is pleased to announce Release 8 of data 
collected by the MErcury Surface, Space ENvironment, GEochemistry, 
and Ranging (MESSENGER) mission.  After a 6.6-year cruise phase, during 
which the spacecraft flew by Earth once, Venus twice, and Mercury 
three times, MESSENGER entered orbit about the innermost planet on 
18 March 2011, becoming the first spacecraft ever to do so. The primary 
orbital phase lasted one Earth-year, and the spacecraft is now in an 
extended year of orbital operations.

This delivery extends the formatted raw and calibrated data available
at the PDS for all seven MESSENGER science instruments and the radio 
science investigation from 17 September 2011 to 25 March 2012. SPICE 
data from launch through the period of this release are also included.  
With this release, data are now available to the public for the second 
full Mercury solar day of MESSENGER orbital operations.

All data sets in this MESSENGER release can be accessed from:

ANNOUNCING LUNARCUBES SCIENCE BRIEFING AT DPS RENO, NV

In the last ten years five nations have sent nine missions
to the Moon and in the next decade there will be many followup
missions, add in the Google X Prize teams and space entrepreneurs 
like Planetary Resources and we will have ten to twenty missions
to cis-Lunar space including several Lunar landers.

All of these missions are looking for science components, but are also 
in a hurry to plant the flag or win the prize, with or without good 
science on board.

What simple science would you like to do?
Experiments can range from demonstrations to that one
measurement that could advance your science if only you had it.

Dates:
* LunarCubes Science Briefing, DPS Reno, NV - Oct 17, 2012
* LunarCubes workshop Mountain View CA (Nov 4-6, 2012) - CANCELLED
* LunarCubes Engineering Briefing, Ames, CA - Nov 2012 (Date TBD)
* LunarCubes Missions Briefing, KSC, FL - April 11, 2013
* 1st International Workshop on LunarCubes, Mountain View CA, 
   Nov 6-8, 2013

Video presentations and remote attendance are an 
integral part of our planning. Please consider virtual presentation/
attendance.
