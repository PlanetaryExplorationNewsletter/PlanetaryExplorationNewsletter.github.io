TENURE TRACK FACULTY POSITION IN THEORETICAL ASTROPHYSICS AT U. 
MARYLAND

The Department of Astronomy at the University of Maryland College Park
invites applications for a tenure-track faculty position. Outstanding
candidates in any area of theoretical astrophysics will be considered.  
A PhD in physics, astronomy or a related discipline is required, and 
the successful candidate must have an established record of research
excellence. As the duties of this position include undergraduate and
graduate teaching, a potential for teaching excellence is necessary. We
are searching for candidates at the Assistant Professor (tenure-track)
level, but will consider applications for a more senior (tenured) rank
in exceptional cases.

Applications must be submitted through:

http://jobs.umd.edu/applicants/Central?quickFind=57797

A complete application must include a CV, a statement of research 
interests and plans, and a statement of teaching philosophy. In 
addition, the candidate must arrange for 3 letters of reference to be 
sent by e-mail to profsearch@astro.umd.edu.  For full consideration, 
all application materials (including letters) must be received by 
30 November 2012.  Any queries concerning this position can be directed 
to the chair of the search committee, Prof. Derek Richardson 
(dcr@astro.umd.edu).

GERALD A. SOFFEN MEMORIAL FUND TRAVEL GRANTS FOR 2012

The Gerald A. Soffen Memorial Fund is pleased to announce the last 
2012 Travel Grant application opportunity for undergraduate and 
graduate students pursuing studies in fields of space science and 
engineering. 

The Travel Grants, in the amount of $500, enable student recipients to 
attend professional meetings to present their research. The Fall 2012 
Travel Grant application deadline is October 15, 2012.

Jerry Soffen, a biologist by training, led a distinguished career in 
NASA, including serving as the Project Scientist for Viking and as an 
architect for the NASA Astrobiology Institute. The Travel Grant 
continues Jerry's dedication to educating and involving future 
generations in space science and engineering pursuits.

The electronic application materials and instructions are located on 
the Soffen Fund website: 
 
http://SoffenFund.org

Questions regarding the application or application process may be 
sent to: info@SoffenFund.org

NASA POSTDOCTORAL FELLOWSHIPS

The NASA Postdoctoral Program (NPP) offers scientists and engineers 
unique opportunities to conduct research at NASA Centers. Each NPP 
fellowship opportunity is designed to advance NASA research in a 
specific project related to space science, earth science, aeronautics, 
exploration systems, lunar science, astrobiology, or astrophysics.

Applicants must have a Ph.D. or equivalent degree in hand before 
beginning the fellowship, but may apply while completing the degree 
requirements. U. S. citizens, Lawful Permanent Residents, and foreign 
nationals eligible for J-1 status as a Research Scholar may apply.

Stipends start at $53,500 per year, with supplements for high 
cost-of-living areas and for certain academic specialties. Financial 
assistance is available for relocation and health insurance, and 
$8,000 per year is provided for professional travel.

Applications are accepted three times each year: March 1, July 1, 
and November 1.

UPDATES TO THE MEPAG GOALS DOCUMENT FOR COMMUNITY REVIEW

The two proposed revisions are:

1. A general update to the description of Goal IV, to bring it into 
alignment with the results of the MEPAG Precursor Science Analysis 
Group (P-SAG). P-SAG's analysis was structured in the form of 
"strategic knowledge gaps" and "gap-filling activities", along with 
an update to our understanding of their priority and required timing.  
The P-SAG analysis was completed several months ago, and it was 
presented by the MEPAG Chair at the Workshop on "Concepts and 
Approaches for Mars Exploration" at the LPI.  For Reference, the 
P-SAG report is at: 

http://mepag.jpl.nasa.gov/reports/psag.html

2. An update to Investigations IIIA-7 and IIIB-1 that relate to the 
martian interior. These revisions are driven by the MEPAG NET-SAG 
study, which was completed in March, 2010, but which never was 
institutionalized by incorporation into the Goals Document.

Both proposed updates are available at: 

http://mepag.jpl.nasa.gov/reports/goip.html

We request that any comments be sent to Vicky Hamilton 
(hamilton@boulder.swri.edu) and Charles Budney 
(Charles.J.Budney@jpl.nasa.gov) by October 4th.
