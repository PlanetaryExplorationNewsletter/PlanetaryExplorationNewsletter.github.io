[NASA] SEEKING NOMINATIONS FOR SERVICE ON NASA SCIENCE ADVISORY
SUBCOMMITTEES

NASA announces its annual invitation for public nominations for 
service on NASA science advisory subcommittees.  These science 
advisory subcommittees report to the Science Committee of the NASA 
Advisory Council (NAC). U.S. citizens may nominate individuals and 
also submit self-nominations for consideration as potential members 
of NASA's science advisory subcommittees. NASA is committed to 
selecting members to serve on its science advisory subcommittees 
based on their individual expertise, knowledge, experience, and 
current/past contributions to the relevant subject area.
 
These are not full-time positions. Successful nominees will be 
required to attend meetings of the subcommittee approximately two to 
four times a year, either in person (NASA covers travel-related 
expenses for this non-compensated appointment) or via telecon/WebEx.  
Successful nominees who are not already government employees will 
become Special Government Employees (SGEs). All successful nominees 
will be required to submit a confidential financial disclosure form, 
and undergo a conflict of interest review by the NASA Office of the 
General Counsel, before their appointment is finalized.
 
DATES: The deadline for NASA receipt of all public nominations is 
November 14, 2012.

[NASA] ANNOUNCEMENT OF FLIGHT OPPORTUNITIES FOR PAYLOADS

The NASA Dryden Flight Research Center has released a solicitation 
entitled "NASA Announcement of Flight Opportunities (AFO) for Payloads
Maturing Crosscutting Technologies that Advance Multiple Future Space 
Missions to Flight Readiness Status." The current solicitation provides 
access to flights on parabolic flights, suborbital Reusable Launch 
Vehicles (sRLV), and high-altitude balloons.

Applications are due on or before 11:59 PM Eastern Time December 21, 
2012. The solicitation is available by opening the NASA Research 
Opportunities home page at: 

http://nspires.nasaprs.com

Select "Solicitations," then select "Open Solicitations," and, select 
"NOCT110 Announcement of Flight Opportunities." 

NASA's Office of the Chief Technologist (OCT) seeks to mature towards 
flight readiness status crosscutting technologies that perform relevant
environment testing and advance multiple future space missions.

Science payloads will not be evaluated under this announcement. 
Prospective responders with science payloads are encouraged to respond 
to open solicitations for science from the NASA Science Mission 
Directorate (SMD) and Human Exploration and Operations Research 
Mission Directorate (HEOMD).

All applications must be submitted electronically through NSPIRES by an
authorized organizational representative (AOR). 

Comments and questions may be sent via e-mail to 
peer-review-afo@nasaprs.com.

FACULTY POSITION AT THE UNIVERSITY OF ARIZONA

The Department of Planetary Sciences/Lunar and Planetary Laboratory at 
the University of Arizona expects to have a tenured or tenure-track 
faculty position. Candidates in all areas of planetary science will be 
encouraged to apply. Successful candidates will teach at all levels, 
(freshman through advanced graduate classes). They will establish and 
maintain a distinguished research program in the field of planetary 
sciences and will supervise graduate students. Salary is dependent on 
qualifications. For an appointment above the rank of Assistant 
Professor, candidates must have an internationally recognized record of 
distinguished scientific achievement, leadership, and teaching ability 
in the planetary sciences. To be considered for appointment at the rank 
of Assistant Professor, candidates must demonstrate clear promise of 
such achievement. 

We plan to begin reviewing applications on November 15, 2012, and will 
continue until the position is filled. The starting date for the 
appointment is anticipated to be August 12, 2013. The official 
application will be online. However, inquiries and preliminary 
application materials, including a CV with publication list, statement 
of research interests, statement of teaching philosophy, and names and 
addresses of at least four references may be submitted to: 
 
Professor Timothy D. Swindle

LLOYD V. BERKNER SPACE POLICY INTERNSHIPS - SUMMER AND AUTUMN 2013
 
The Lloyd V. Berkner Space Policy Internship provides promising 
undergraduate and graduate students with the opportunity to work in the 
area of civil space research policy in the nation's capital, under the 
aegis of the National Research Council’s Space Science Board. The 
summer program is open to undergraduates. The autumn program is open 
to undergraduate and graduate students. The deadlines for applications 
for the summer and autumn 2013 programs are 1 February and 7 June, 
respectively. Candidate(s) selected for participation in the summer and 
autumn 2013 programs will be contacted no later than 1 March and 5 July, 
respectively.
 
All applicants must provide the following four items:
 
1. A resume;
2. A brief statement (not to exceed one printed page) indicating 
academic interests and experience, and some indication of how the 
internship relates to the applicants long-term career plans;
3. Letters of references from three college/university faculty members 
familiar with the candidate’s background and abilities; and
4. An official copy of academic transcript to be sent from the 
college/university registrar.
 
Additional information about the program, including the application 
procedure, can be found at:

NASA POSTDOCTORAL FELLOWSHIPS

The NASA Postdoctoral Program (NPP) offers scientists and engineers 
unique opportunities to conduct research at NASA Centers. Each NPP 
fellowship opportunity is designed to advance NASA research in a 
specific project related to space science, earth science, aeronautics, 
exploration systems, lunar science, astrobiology, or astrophysics.

Applicants must have a Ph.D. or equivalent degree in hand before 
beginning the fellowship, but may apply while completing the degree 
requirements. U. S. citizens, Lawful Permanent Residents, and foreign 
nationals eligible for J-1 status as a Research Scholar may apply.

Stipends start at $53,500 per year, with supplements for high 
cost-of-living areas and for certain academic specialties. Financial 
assistance is available for relocation and health insurance, and 
$8,000 per year is provided for professional travel.

Applications are accepted three times each year: March 1, July 1, 
and November 1.

CALL FOR PAPERS FOR SPECIAL SECTION OF JGR – PLANETS

Submissions are now being accepted for a Special Section of JGR-
Planets entitled "Early Mars III: Geologic and Hydrologic Evolution, 
Physical and Climate Environments, and the Implications for Life."

Final Submission Deadline:  14 December 2012

Guest Editor:  Stephen Clifford, Lunar and Planetary Institute 

The influx of new data received from recent spacecraft missions to 
Mars, the study of the martian meteorites, recent progress in early 
climate modeling, the growing evidence of the role of water in the 
planet's evolution, and the rapid pace of new discoveries about the 
origin and diversity of life on Earth have reinvigorated interest in 
both the conditions that prevailed on Mars during its first billion 
years of geologic history and their implications for the development of 
life. Although this special section stems from the recent Third 
International Conference on Early Mars (http://www.lpi.usra.edu/
meetings/earlymars2012/), participation in this conference is not a 
prerequisite for submitting a manuscript for consideration. Submitted 
manuscripts should have a substantial early Mars focus, but they may 
also address terrestrial analogs and processes when there is a clear 
and demonstrated relevance to Mars. 

Manuscripts are to be submitted through the AGU's Geophysical 
Electronic Manuscript Submissions System (GEMS) website
for JGR-Planets:

http://jgr-planets-submit.agu.org/cgi-bin/main.plex
