[NASA] SOLAR SYSTEM EXPLORATION AT 50!

James L. Green, Director, Planetary Science Division, NASA HQ

In August 1962 NASA launched Mariner 2 to Venus and a new era in solar
system exploration began. NASA invented planetary science. It took it 
out of the realm of just seeing planets through telescopes, to the era 
of 'up close and personal' with flybys, orbiters, landers, rovers, and 
samples returned.

The NASA History Program Office, the Division of Space History at the
National Air and Space Museum, the NASA Planetary Science Division, and 
the Jet Propulsion Laboratory invite papers relating to the history of 
planetary exploration to a symposium that will be held in Washington, 
D.C., on October 25-26, 2012. A subset of the papers will be published.
 
Come join us in this retrospective to celebrate 50 years of fabulous
planetary science, entitled 'Solar System Exploration @ 50.' The 
deadline for abstract submissions is February 21, 2012.

CALL FOR ABSTRACTS, EGU SESSION: PLANETARY GEODYNAMICS

Dear Colleagues,
We would like to invite you to a new EGU session: GD1.1/PS2.7 Planetary 
Geodynamics.

This session invites contributions that evaluate geodynamic processes 
from a comparative perspective, using either the Earth or other 
planetary bodies as a guide. We seek to understand the interaction of 
mantle dynamics and lithospheric processes, and their resulting surface 
expression, under a range of different (plate) tectonic and mantle 
regimes. We welcome studies on all aspect of comparative planetology, 
such as, for example, analysis of satellite potential field or remote 
sensing data, numerical modelling, and analytical studies that will 
give us a better understanding of the physics and/or thermal, 
mechanical and rheological properties of our Earth as well as other 
planets or exoplanets.

[NASA] POSTDOCTORAL FELLOWSHIPS

The NASA Postdoctoral Program (NPP) offers scientists and engineers 
unique opportunities to conduct research at NASA Centers. Each NPP 
fellowship opportunity is designed to advance NASA research in a 
specific project related to space science, earth science, aeronautics, 
space operations, exploration systems, lunar science, or astrobiology.

Applicants must have a Ph.D. or equivalent degree in hand before 
beginning the fellowship, but may apply while completing the degree 
requirements. U. S. citizens, Lawful Permanent Residents, and foreign 
nationals eligible for J-1 status as a Research Scholar may apply.  
An H-1B Visa status is not acceptable because the NPP is not an 
employment program.

Stipends for Postdoctoral Fellows start at $50,000 per year, with 
moderate supplements for high cost-of-living areas and for certain 
academic specialties. Funds are available for relocation expenses, up 
to a specified limit, and health insurance is available through the 
program. Fellows also receive $8,000 per appointment year to support 
travel to conferences, meetings, and other activities that directly 
support their research.

Applications are accepted three times each year: March 1, July 1, 
and November 1.

EXPLORATION SESSION AT THE 39TH COSPAR SCIENTIFIC ASSEMBLY

Mysore, India, 14 -22 July 2012

Dear Colleague, 
We want to draw your attention to the following session:
 
PEX2: A vision for space exploration: Science as a bridge connecting
stakeholders

The abstract deadline is 10 February 2012.

A shared scientific vision focused on the theme of the origins and
evolution of our solar system and life has the power to unite space 
exploration stakeholders, challenge scientists, and capture public 
imagination.  With such a vision in hand, the science community can 
guide and accelerate a program of robotic and human space exploration, 
and share the benefits that those activities confer to society.  This 
scientific focus also has the potential to connect with communities, 
outside of science, seeking knowledge of extraterrestrial environments 
and materials and the potential to support humans away from the Earth.  
This session will include papers that will examine this vision and 
explore its implications for future space activities.
 
Abstract submission instructions are available at:
 
http://www.cospar-assembly.org

Yours sincerely,

Prof. John Rummel, PEX2 Main Scientific Organizer

SPICE USERS: NEW LEAP SECOND FOR SPICE

The IERS has announced a new leap second will take effect at midnight 
preceding 01 July 2012. NAIF has created a new SPICE leapseconds kernel 
(LSK) that is now available from the NAIF server at the usual location: 

ftp://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/pub/naif/generic_kernels/lsk/  

Separate versions for Unix/Linux/Mac (naif0010.tls) and for PCs running 
Windows (naif0010.tls.pc) are available. 

You may begin using this new LSK any time prior to 01 July 2012--it is 
fully backwards compatible with the current LSK. 

You MUST switch to this new LSK by 01 July 2012 for any time conversions 
involving epochs after that date.

The new LSK has been deployed by NAIF to the appropriate SPICE kernel 
locations on JPL flight project servers where SPICE kernels are managed 
by NAIF. However, this will cover just a fraction of locations where the 
SPICE LSK is needed; those receiving this email should be sure local 
copies are updated, and appropriate coordination of this update is done 
where needed.

The best way to receive important SPICE announcements such as this is 
to sign up with the "spice_announce" Mailman notification system:
