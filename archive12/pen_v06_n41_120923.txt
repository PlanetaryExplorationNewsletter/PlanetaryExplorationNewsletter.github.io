[NASA] COOPERATIVE AGREEMENT NOTICE DRAFT AND REQUEST FOR COMMENTS

NASA’s Science Mission Directorate and Human Exploration and Operations 
Mission Directorate intend to release a Cooperative Agreement Notice 
(CAN) for the NEW NASA science and exploration institute (yet unnamed) 
no earlier than October 2012. The new institute will retain the 
successful structure of the NASA Lunar Science Institute. The new 
institute will be a virtual research organization that leverages 
knowledge and expertise from the science and exploration communities 
and supports NASA’s goals in lunar and planetary science and human 
exploration of the solar system. 

The research scope for the CAN spans the fields of lunar, Near Earth 
Asteroids (NEAs), and Martian moon sciences, with preference for 
topics related to the joint interests of both planetary science and 
human exploration. 

NASA is requesting comments from the science and exploration 
communities on the high level salient portions of the CAN. Interested 
individuals should visit:

http://science.nasa.gov/researchers/sara/lunar-institute/ 

where they will find the draft portions of the CAN for which NASA 
requests comments. Comments will be taken through 11:59 PM ET 
October 10, 2012. 

Questions and comments (subject: "Institute Comment" or "Institute 
Question") should be addressed to both Bobby Fogel (rfogel@nasa.gov) 
and Michael Wargo (michael.wargo@nasa.gov).

MAVEN MARS SCIENCE COMMUNITY WORKSHOP

Preliminary agenda for the Dec. 2 MAVEN Mars Science Community workshop 
has been posted to our web site at:

http://lasp.colorado.edu/maven

The workshop will run all day, and is intended to provide the science 
community with more information about the mission than has been 
available previously. It will take place on the Sunday prior to the 
AGU meeting in San Francisco, at a venue to be announced.  

No registration is required.

If you have questions, or to get on the mailing list for future 
announcements about the workshop, contact:

OUTER PLANETS COLLOQUIUM SERIES

Would your institution like a visit and colloquium presentation from 
an expert in outer solar system science, at no expense to you?  Would 
you like travel support to share your outer solar system research?  
Presenters and host institutions are sought for the Outer Planets 
Colloquium Series, a program that matches planetary scientists with 
university campuses and research institutions.

Participation is open to two- and four-year undergraduate colleges and 
research institutions throughout the United States. Host institutions 
commit to making the necessary local arrangements. Presenters are 
encouraged to address the needs of the next generation of scientists 
(graduate students, interns, and undergraduates) and to give an 
additional presentation that is free and open to the general public. 
Other interactions that increase awareness of outer solar system 
science may also be considered as part of the visit. These may include 
guest teaching a class, interacting informally with students 
and faculty, or other outreach activities.

A current list of presenters and their prospective talks is provided 
on the Series website.  

The Colloquium Series will cover the presenter's travel expenses.  
There will be no honorarium for the speaker.

Application details and further information may be found at:
