WOMEN IN ASTRONOMY DISCUSSION HOUR AT DPS

Wednesday, Oct. 17th, 12:00-1:30 pm

Join us for an informal meeting and discussion over lunch. We will have 
a focus on Work-Life Satisfaction with a brief presentation, and plenty 
of time for discussion of other relevant topics chosen by participants.  
Please feel free to bring any information/announcements related to 
women in astronomy and planetary science to share. Due to the 
generosity of an anonymous donor and the DPS committee, we will be able 
to provide lunch this year. All are welcome, but pre-registration at: 

http://bit.ly/WL_2012 

is required by Oct. 1 due to space limitations.

NASA PROPOSAL WRITING WORKSHOP AT DPS

Sunday, Oct. 14th, 12:30-4:00 pm

This NASA sponsored workshop is open to all interested planetary 
scientists at no cost. At some time in your career as a scientist, you 
will need to obtain funding to conduct your research. Perhaps that 
time is now, perhaps it is still a few years away, but that time will 
come. Are you prepared for it? Fortunately, NASA awards funding every 
year for research like yours. But even in the best of times NASA 
selects only one out of every three proposals submitted for funding.  
Proposal writing is a necessary skill for every scientist, and just 
like the rest of your skills it needs to be developed. The session will 
be presented by Dr. Curt Niebur, a program scientist and NASA HQ, and 
will focus on understanding NASA's research programs and will include 
information on how to write a research proposal, where to apply for 
funding, and pathways for participation on missions. Light refreshments 
will be provided during breaks. More information and registration:

NASA POSTDOCTORAL FELLOWSHIPS

The NASA Postdoctoral Program (NPP) offers scientists and engineers 
unique opportunities to conduct research at NASA Centers. Each NPP 
fellowship opportunity is designed to advance NASA research in a 
specific project related to space science, earth science, aeronautics, 
exploration systems, lunar science, astrobiology, or astrophysics.

Applicants must have a Ph.D. or equivalent degree in hand before 
beginning the fellowship, but may apply while completing the degree 
requirements. U.S. citizens, Lawful Permanent Residents, and foreign 
nationals eligible for J-1 status as a Research Scholar may apply.

Stipends start at $53,500 per year, with supplements for high 
cost-of-living areas and for certain academic specialties. Financial 
assistance is available for relocation and health insurance, and 
$8,000 per year is provided for professional travel.

Applications are accepted three times each year: March 1, July 1, and 
November 1.

VOLCANO-LITHOSPHERE INTERACTIONS ON THE TERRESTRIAL PLANETS 
POSTDOCTORAL FELLOWSHIP: LUNAR AND PLANETARY INSTITUTE

The Universities Space Research Association - Houston invites 
applications for a postdoctoral fellowship in geophysical studies of 
the growth/evolution of large volcanic edifices and provinces on the 
terrestrial planets.

The candidate will work with Dr. Patrick McGovern exploring mechanical 
interactions between intrusive and extrusive volcanic edifice growth, 
lithospheric flexural response, and magma ascent, using numerical 
modeling techniques, including Finite Element (FEM) and Distinct 
Element (DEM) Methods. Research will also entail analysis of imagery, 
topography, gravity, and spectral datasets for large planetary 
volcanoes in order to constrain the modeling efforts. Potential bodies 
of interest include Venus, Io, the Moon, Earth, and Mars.

Requirements are a recent Ph.D. in geophysics or geology. Experience 
quantitative modeling of geophysical, geological, or magmatic 
processes with advanced codes as COMSOL Multiphysics (FEM) and PFC 
(DEM). Programming languages, MATLAB or FORTRAN 95 desirable. The 
position is two years with a possible extension to three years.

Send letter of interest, curriculum vita with a list of relevant 
publications, brief statement of research interests, and three 
references to:

REQUEST FOR COORDINATOR FOR PLANETARY ASTRONOMY CONCEPTS WITH A FUTURE
2.4-M SPACE TELESCOPE

NASA is exploring the use of a 2.4-m mirror system recently gifted to 
them by the National Reconnaissance Office; this system could be the 
nucleus of a new ultraviolet-optical (UVO) space telescope. Information 
is available at the website of a recent Princeton meeting: 

http://www.princeton.edu/astro/news-events/public-events
/new-telescope-meeting/ 

including a program with links to the presented talks. The first 
letter of intent to use this system focuses on astrophysics 
applications. NASA has indicated that broader usage (including 
planetary science) will be considered in a future announcement. Paul 
Scowen (Arizona State University) has offered to coordinate initial 
studies for non-astrophysics uses. He requests information about the 
requirements planetary scientists would have for a 2.4m UVO space 
telescope. The task would be to outline what performance 
specifications planetary astronomers would like/need in terms of 
imaging quality, resolution, throughput, wavelength bandpass, spectral 
resolution and coverage, field of view, and limiting surface brightness 
detection in, say, 1000 seconds. Someone is needed to coordinate 
responses from the planetary community and provide them to Paul, and 
responses are needed for the coordinator to coordinate. If you are 
interested being this coordinator, please contact Heidi Hammel 
(hbh@alum.mit.edu).
