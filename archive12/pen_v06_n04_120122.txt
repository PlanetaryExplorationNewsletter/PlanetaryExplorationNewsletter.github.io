CALL FOR ABSTRACTS: PLANETARY AND EXO-PLANETARY ATMOSPHERES, SURFACE
INTERACTIONS AND ASTROBIOLOGY

This year's joint Canadian Meteorological and Oceanographic Society
(CMOS) / American Meteorological Society (AMS) Congress to be held in
Montreal from May 29 to June 1, 2012 will feature a session entitled
Planetary and Exo-Planetary Atmospheres, Surface Interactions and
Astrobiology. This new session, held for the first time this year, 
seeks to bring together research in atmospheres beyond our own and the
processes which affect their composition and dynamics from researchers
across Canada and the World. For more information, please consult the
links below or contact John Moores at john.e.moores@gmail.com .

[NASA] SMD GRADUATE STUDENT FELLOWSHIPS

Proposals for SMD's graduate fellowships are due February 1, 2012.

The NASA Earth and Space Science Fellowship (NESSF) Program - 2012/
2013 Academic Year, solicits applications from accredited U.S. 
Universities on behalf of individuals pursuing Masters or Doctoral 
(Ph.D.) degrees in Earth and space sciences, or related disciplines, 
at respective institutions. The purpose of NESSF is to ensure continued
training of a highly qualified workforce in disciplines needed to 
achieve NASA's scientific goals outlined above. Awards resulting from 
the competitive selection will be made in the form of training grants 
to the respective universities with the advisor serving as the 
principal investigator.

The deadline for proposals is February 1, 2012.

2012 NASA PLANETARY SCIENCE SUMMER SCHOOL

NASA is accepting applications from science and engineering post-docs, 
recent PhDs, and doctoral students for its 24th  Annual Planetary 
Science Summer School, which will hold two separate sessions this 
summer (18-22 June and 16-20 July) at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory 
in Pasadena, Calif. During the program and pre-session webinars, 
student teams will carry out the equivalent of an early mission 
concept study, prepare a proposal authorization review presentation, 
present it to a review board, and receive feedback. By the end of the
session, students will have a clearer understanding of the life cycle
of a space mission; relationships between mission design, cost, and 
schedule; and the tradeoffs necessary to stay within cost and 
schedule while preserving the quality of science. Applications are 
due March 28, 2012. Partial financial support is available for a 
limited number of individuals. Further information is available at:

NASA POSTDOCTORAL FELLOWSHIPS

The NASA Postdoctoral Program (NPP) offers scientists and engineers 
unique opportunities to conduct research at NASA Centers. Each NPP 
fellowship opportunity is designed to advance NASA research in a 
specific project related to space science, earth science, aeronautics,
space operations, exploration systems, lunar science, or astrobiology.

Applicants must have a Ph.D. or equivalent degree in hand before 
beginning the fellowship, but may apply while completing the degree 
requirements. U. S. citizens, Lawful Permanent Residents, and foreign
nationals eligible for J-1 status as a Research Scholar may apply.  
An H-1B Visa status is not acceptable because the NPP is not an 
employment program.

Stipends for Postdoctoral Fellows start at $50,000 per year, with 
moderate supplements for high cost-of-living areas and for certain 
academic specialties. Funds are available for relocation expenses, 
up to a specified limit, and health insurance is available through 
the program. Fellows also receive $8,000 per appointment year to 
support travel to conferences, meetings, and other activities that 
directly support their research.

Applications are accepted three times each year: March 1, July 1, 
and November 1.

UPCOMING MEPAG MEETING / MARS FUTURE LANDING SITE WORKSHOP

Dear Colleagues,

Just a reminder that if you have not already done so and are planning 
to attend the MEPAG meeting at the Hilton Dulles International Airport
in Herndon, Virginia (Washington, DC area), on February 27-28, 2012, 
we would appreciate your RSVP so that we can plan for you.

A Mars Future Landing Site Workshop will be held at the same venue 
following the MEPAG meeting, February 29 thru March 2, 2012.

There is a block of hotel rooms set aside at the Hilton Dulles I
nternational Airport for both of these events.  The deadline for
the room block is Monday, February 6, 2012.

Regards,
Joyce N. Pulliam

[NASA] 1ST ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT 
CONFERENCE 

Dates: June 26-28, 2012
Abstract deadline: January 30, 2012
Location: The Denver Marriott City Center
Conference organized by the AAS in partnership with NASA and the 
Center for the Advancement of Science in Space Inc. (CASIS). The 
program outline is posted at:

http://www.astronautical.org/node/96

Manuscripts are solicited on topics related to science and technology
activities (past, present, planned and proposed) on the ISS.
 
This conference will focus on ISS research and development-research 
results and future opportunities in physical sciences, life sciences, 
Earth and space sciences, and spacecraft technology development. 
Plenary sessions will highlight major results and pathways to future 
opportunities.  Organizations managing and funding research on ISS, 
including NASA programs and the ISS National Laboratory will provide
overviews of upcoming opportunities.  Parallel technical sessions 
will provide tracks for scientists to be updated on significant 
accomplishments to date within their disciplines.  The meeting also 
includes a workshop designed to help new users take this information 
and develop their own ideas for experiments using this unique 
laboratory.  Potential ISS users who attend will learn: "What can I 
do on the ISS?  How can I do it?  What are sources for funding?"

MICROSYMPOSIUM 53 - EARLY HISTORY OF THE TERRESTRIAL PLANETS: NEW 
INSIGHTS FROM THE MOON AND MERCURY

March 17-18th, 2012, at The Woodlands Waterway Marriot, just prior to 
LPSC 43. Exploration of the Moon and Mercury has outlined the basic 
events, themes and processes in the first half of Solar System 
history.  Recent results are challenging many of these fundamental 
views on the Moon, and on Mercury, MESSENGER data have revealed 
crustal compositions quite unlike those anticipated, a cratering 
record that differs from the Moon in interesting ways, and a global 
magnetic field with an unusually strong asymmetry about the planetary 
equator.  These findings have clearly challenged an earlier vision of 
a "Moon-like" Mercury, and have placed into question most earlier 
paradigms for the origin and evolution of the innermost planet. 
Although the two bodies are different, it is clear that comparison 
between the Moon and Mercury may help to resolve outstanding problems 
in the origin and evolution of each, and shed new light on the 
fundamental themes and events in the histories of the terrestrial 
planets. Microsymposium 53 will feature a summary of these new 
discoveries, and bring together scientists to ponder their 
implications.  For more information and registration, see:

Abstract: Polarimetry as a remote sensing tool to explore our solar
system, including planetary atmospheres, satellite surfaces, ring
systems, comets, asteroids and exoplanetary atmospheres is a rapidly
growing field. This session will include invited and contributed talks
on: (i) application of the principles of polarization to remote
sensing; and (ii) role of polarization as an independent and
complementary remote sensing tool to imaging and spectroscopic
techniques. Welcome observers, theorists and experimentalists that use
polarimetry to study any component of planetary systems.

ESLAB SYMPOSIUM ON FORMATION AND EVOLUTION OF MOONS, ESTEC

The Netherlands, 25-29 June 2012
Deadline for abstract: 2nd April 2012

Understanding the formation and evolution of the natural satellites
of the planets is important, as a piece of the wider puzzle concerning
the formation and evolution of the solar system as a whole. Significant
progress has been achieved recently on the formation of the Moon and of
the regular satellites of the giant planets. However, many questions
regarding the different formation mechanisms are still unanswered.
The goal of the symposium is to review all possible scientific
mechanisms for forming the moons, and for driving their subsequent
evolutions, and their consequences on our current understanding of
solar system formation and evolution.
