EDITORIAL: US PLANETARY PROGRAM POISED TO LOSE A GENERATION OF 
SCIENTISTS

Mark V. Sykes
Planetary Science Institute

The US solar system exploration program is supported by NASA-funded 
scientists at government facilities, universities, and private 
companies. These scientists provide basic research that defines and 
justifies our missions and provide the data analyses from which 
Americans receive the benefit of their tax-dollar investment. Their 
work directly advances the strategic goals of the NASA Planetary 
Division and strongly contributes to STEM educational efforts across 
the country. The research and analysis programs provide an essential 
component to sustaining this workforce. National Research Council 
reports have long recognized these programs as fundamental to US solar 
system exploration efforts. The recent NRC planetary decadal survey 
gave them high priority, independent of the fiscal situation (the worse 
the fiscal climate, the more important these programs are to sustaining 
national capabilities in this area). Unfortunately, policy decisions by 
NASA leadership have resulted in selection rates for competitive 
proposals plummeting to historic lows with negative impact. Community 
testimonials are posted at:

Younger planetary scientists in particular face an imminent crisis in 
their careers. They will be lost first. Many more will follow. The 
consequences will be long-term.
