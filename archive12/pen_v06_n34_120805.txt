EDITORIAL

MSL lands this evening, but our community will not be "forever 
changed." I disagree with Jim Green, NASA Planetary Science Division 
Director. Everything we undertake in solar system exploration is filled 
with risk. We work to reduce that risk, but it is never zero. MSL 
landing successfully will be a great engineering feat. It commences an 
ambitious investigation of an area that should yield rich, detailed 
information about Mars' past and its potential for having hosted life 
in that past. Failure will not put our nation's planetary science 
program "at stake". Overreaction can. We are weakened by bad policy 
recommendations and decisions of the past ten years, crippling the 
former workhorse Discovery program and canceling the Mars Scout 
program, while backroom deals are pursued to allocate yet more 
resources to large, uncompeted projects. The greatest challenge facing 
U.S. solar system exploration is making the transition from an adolescent
focus on firsts to rebuilding our foundational programs and embracing 
science as "the endless frontier." To quote Vannevar Bush, it "is one 
essential key to our security as a nation, to our better health, to 
more jobs, to a higher standard of living, and to our cultural 
progress."

[NASA] MATURATION OF INSTRUMENTS FOR SOLAR SYSTEM EXPLORATION 
(MATISSE) PROGRAM

The MatISSE Program supports the advanced development of 
spacecraft-based instruments that show promise for use in future 
planetary missions. The goal of the program is to develop and 
demonstrate planetary and astrobiology science instruments to the point 
where they may be proposed in response to future announcements of 
flight opportunity without additional extensive technology development 
(approximately TRL 6). The proposed instrument must address specific 
scientific objectives of likely future planetary science missions.

The name of this program was formerly Astrobiology Science and 
Technology for Instrument Development (ASTID).

Notices of intent are requested by August 31, 2012, and proposals are 
due by October 31, 2012.

On a related note, we regret to inform potential proposers that 
Planetary Instrument Concepts for the Advancement of Solar System 
Observations (PICASSO) and Astrobiology Science and Technology for 
Exploring Planets (ASTEP) will not be solicited this year. However, we 
anticipate that they will be solicited in ROSES 2013 and draft text 
for PICASSO is presented in ROSES 2012.

Questions concerning either PICASSO or MatISSE, may be addressed to:

NASA POSTDOCTORAL FELLOWSHIPS

The NASA Postdoctoral Program (NPP) offers scientists and engineers 
unique opportunities to conduct research at NASA Centers. Each NPP 
fellowship opportunity is designed to advance NASA research in a 
specific project related to space science, earth science, aeronautics, 
exploration systems, lunar science, astrobiology, or astrophysics.

Applicants must have a Ph.D. or equivalent degree in hand before 
beginning the fellowship, but may apply while completing the degree 
requirements. U. S. citizens, Lawful Permanent Residents, and foreign 
nationals eligible for J-1 status as a Research Scholar may apply.

Stipends start at $53,500 per year, with supplements for high 
cost-of-living areas and for certain academic specialties. Financial 
assistance is available for relocation and health insurance, and 
$8,000 per year is provided for professional travel.

Applications are accepted three times each year: March 1, July 1, and 
November 1.

AGU FALL 2012 SPECIAL SESSION P003. AIRLESS BODY PETROLOGY THROUGH 
SAMPLES AND REMOTE SENSING: DIVERSE APPROACHES TO COMMON PROBLEMS

We are pleased to announce the title special session at the 2012 AGU 
Meeting in San Francisco, CA, December 3-7, 2012.

This interdisciplinary session is sponsored by the Planetary Sciences 
section and co-sponsored by the Volcanology-Geochemistry-Petrology 
(VGP) section. It emphasizes both remote sensing and sample-based 
investigations of airless body petrology.

Numerous recent and current missions are providing planetary scientists 
with remote sensing data of unprecedented quality and volume. 
Concurrently, improvements in laboratory instrumentation are enabling 
new fundamental discoveries from analysis of returned samples and 
meteorites. Communication between both fields is crucial for addressing 
broad planetary science questions and maximizing the science return of 
current and future planetary exploration. This session will further 
research in planetary petrology by encouraging such synergistic 
research through contributions from remote sensing and sample-based 
analyses. Submissions are welcomed for studies of any airless body.

Please consider submitting an abstract for this session. Please visit: 

http://fallmeeting.agu.org/2012/ 

Submission deadline is August 8, 2012.

Invited Speakers: 

Hap McSween, Jeff Taylor, Juliane Gross, Tim McCoy

Conveners: 

Peter Isaacson, Rachel Klima, Rhiannon Mayne

We look forward to seeing you in San Francisco.

AGU FALL 2012 SPECIAL SESSION P011. LABORATORY INVESTIGATIONS 
SUPPORTING ANALYSIS OF DATASETS FROM MARS, THE MOON, AND OTHER
PLANETARY BODIES

This session is co-sponsored by MSA.

Planetary missions over the past decade have gathered a wealth of data, 
including spectral (e.g., TES, OMEGA, CRISM, M3), thermophysical (e.g., 
Diviner, THEMIS), and geochemical/mineralogical (e.g., GRS, APXS, MB, 
CheMin, ChemCam, SAM). Rigorous laboratory investigations are required 
for instrument calibration and refinement of data interpretation. This 
session will focus on measurements/experiments that relate to 
interpretation of remote sensing or in situ data from planetary bodies. 
Studies that utilize multiple methods/datasets, analog materials, and 
advance quantitative compositional analyses of orbital data or the 
interpretation of MSL/MER instrument data are especially encouraged.

Abstract deadline: August 8th

AGU FALL 2012 SPECIAL SESSION P034. WHAT LURKS IN THE MARTIAN ROCKS AND 
SOIL? INVESTIGATIONS OF SULFATES, PHOSPHATES, AND PERCHLORATES

Sulfates, phosphates, and perchlorates have been found on Mars from
orbit and/or from surface missions. Identification of these minerals
(suites) can enable constraints on the Martian geochemical 
environments. This session will generate a discussion regarding the
conditions for the formation of these minerals on Mars, and methods for
identifying their geological environments and related fluid chemistry.  
Abstracts describing discoveries of sulfates, phosphates, or
perchlorates from surface missions and orbital spacecraft data, and
those covering laboratory analyses and thermodynamic modeling relating
to the hydration state of these minerals and their stability on Mars
are welcome.

Abstract deadline: August 8, 2012, 23:59ET/3:59+1 GMT
