SPECIAL: IMPACT OF DELAYS IN SELECTION AND FUNDING OF RESEARCH AND DATA
ANALYSIS PROGRAM AWARDS

Last week, I requested information from our community about the impact
of delays in R&A selections and awards. Your responses, minus personal 
information, have been posted at:

http://planetarypolicy.org

Consequences include: The personal assumption of research expenses by 
scientists, the potential loss of students, funding instability or 
inadequacy for postdocs, undermining funded research, general loss of 
efficiency in programs and research, a sense of overall lack of support 
for these foundational programs that underpin our solar system 
exploration efforts, and the potential loss of scientists from 
planetary science.

These are not problems caused by Congress. They are not the necessary 
outcome of Continuing Resolutions. They could be obviated by NASA's
adoption of a policy that would require timely allocation of resources 
to these programs and the timely processing of proposals and subsequent
funding of awards.

NASA PLANETARY SCIENCE SUMMER SCHOOL - APPLICATION DEADLINE EXTENDED TO
APRIL 3, 2012

NASA is accepting applications from science and engineering post-docs, 
recent PhDs, and doctoral students for its 24th  Annual Planetary 
Science Summer School, which will hold two separate sessions this 
summer (18-22 June and 16-20 July) at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in 
Pasadena, Calif. During the program and pre-session webinars, student 
teams will carry out the equivalent of an early mission concept study, 
prepare a proposal authorization review presentation, present it to a 
review board, and receive feedback. By the end of the session, students 
will have a clearer understanding of the life cycle of a space mission; 
relationships between mission design, cost, and schedule; and the 
tradeoffs necessary to stay within cost and schedule while preserving 
the quality of science. Applications are due April 3, 2012. Partial 
financial support is available for a limited number of individuals.

NASA POSTDOCTORAL FELLOWSHIPS

The NASA Postdoctoral Program (NPP) offers scientists and engineers 
unique opportunities to conduct research at NASA Centers. Each NPP 
fellowship opportunity is designed to advance NASA research in a 
specific project related to space science, earth science, aeronautics, 
exploration systems, lunar science, astrobiology, or astrophysics.

Applicants must have a Ph.D. or equivalent degree in hand before 
beginning the fellowship, but may apply while completing the degree 
requirements. U. S. citizens, Lawful Permanent Residents, and foreign 
nationals eligible for J-1 status as a Research Scholar may apply.

Stipends start at $50,000 per year, with supplements for high 
cost-of-living areas and for certain academic specialties. Financial 
assistance is available for relocation and health insurance, and 
$8,000 per year is provided for professional travel.

Applications are accepted three times each year: March 1, July 1, and 
November 1.

NASA NEO HUMAN SPACE FLIGHT ACCESSIBLE TARGETS STUDY (NHATS) WEBSITE 
TOOL

http://neo.jpl.nasa.gov/nhats/

Observers, mission planners, and other interested users are invited to 
use a new website tool to view a list of near-Earth asteroids among the 
most accessible for future robotic or human space flight round-trip 
rendezvous missions.

Users can customize the table of accessible NEAs by specifying limits 
on total delta-V, mission duration, stay time at the asteroid, launch 
date interval, asteroid absolute magnitude, and orbit condition code.

Clicking on each object's designation takes the user to an 
object-specific page, which provides additional details, including a 
plot showing total mission delta-V for each combination of mission 
duration and launch date (2015 - 2040). Another click on the object's 
designation opens a new window that provides orbital and physical 
data for the object.

The Near-Earth Object Human Space Flight Accessible Targets Study 
(NHATS) began in September 2010 under the auspices of NASA 
Headquarters Planetary Science Division of the Science Mission 
Directorate in cooperation with the Advanced Exploration Systems 
Division of the Human Exploration and Operations Mission Directorate. 
Its purpose was to identify any known Near-Earth Objects, particularly 
Near-Earth Asteroids (NEAs) that might be accessible by future human 
spaceflight missions.

ISS AND MARS CONFERENCE IN STRASBOURG, FRANCE

On April 12-13, 2012, Explore Mars and International Space University 
are presenting the International Space Station and Mars Conference in 
Strasbourg, France.  Explore Mars is happy to offer members of the PEN 
list a special discount on registration by visiting the registration 
page at: 

http://www.issmars-europe.eventbrite.com  

To get the special discount, enter the discount code: issmarspen

The ISS and Mars Conference will advance the the discussion started in 
2011 of how ISS can help advance the goal sending humans beyond LEO 
and on to Mars.  The conference will feature some of the top names of 
space exploration in Europe and around the world. Confirmed and 
tentative speakers include, Reinhold Ewald (ESA; astronaut), Bruno 
Gardini (ESA), Diego Urbina (Mars500), Ulrich Kuebler (Astrium), Kirk 
Shireman (NASA), Michael Raftery (Boeing),  Sam Scimemi (NASA), and 
many others.

Attendees to the conference will also be able to attend the ISU 
25th Anniversary/Yuri's Night Reception on April 12th at ISU.  This 
will be an exciting and inspiring party on the anniversary of Yuri 
Gagarin's flight.

CONCEPTS SOUGHT FOR PLANETARY SCIENCE FROM A BALLOON-BASED OBSERVATORY

NASA's Planetary Science Division is seeking community input on the 
potential planetary science that could be achieved from a stratospheric 
balloon observatory. A workshop to discuss platform capabilities, 
recent balloon missions for other NASA SMD divisions, and potential 
planetary science applications was held at NASA GRC in late January, 
2012.  Efforts to date have resulted in over 40 concepts for planetary 
science this platform may perform.

The next phase of this effort is to solicit review and comments from 
the broader planetary community. Your participation is crucial to 
ensure that the ideas put forward are the best they can be and are 
reflective of the needs and desires of the broad planetary community.  
Please go to: 

http://www.lpi.usra.edu/balloon_science/ 

Review the information relevant to your science interests and provide 
comments, suggestions, and new ideas by COB April, 30th.

Thank you in advance for you participation!
