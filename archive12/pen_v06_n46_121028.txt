[NASA] REQUEST FOR INPUT: NAMING OF THE NEW NASA SCIENCE AND 
EXPLORATION INSTITUTE

The NASA Lunar Science Institute (NLSI) is expanding to include other 
destinations beyond the Moon, stemming from NASA's Flexible Path 
strategy for human exploration. The new Institute's scope will include 
science and exploration research efforts focusing on solar system 
destinations for human exploration. The new institute will initially 
focus on the Moon, Near Earth Objects, Phobos and Deimos. These 
destinations are the focus of an upcoming Cooperative Agreement 
Notice (CAN) to be issued shortly by NASA. Additionally, heliophysics 
and astrophysics uniquely enabled through observations from these 
objects will be part of the new Institute.

NASA is seeking your input for a name for the new institute, reflective
of its broader scope. For further details, and to submit a suggested 
name, please go to:

http://lunarscience.nasa.gov/newname/ 

All suggestions received by midnight PST Nov. 9, 2012, will be 
considered.

NASA expects to announce the new name in early 2013, however, the NASA 
Lunar Science Institute name will remain in effect until the new teams 
are selected. The new institute will operate under the current NLSI 
leadership and the central office will remain at Ames Research Center.

TENURE-TRACK POSITION, CASE WESTERN RESERVE UNIVERSITY

The Department of Earth, Environmental, and Planetary Sciences at Case
Western Reserve University seeks candidates for a tenure-track faculty
growth position. We seek outstanding candidates who will complement 
existing departmental strengths in planetary sciences, geochemistry, 
and surficial processes. It is anticipated that the position will be 
filled at the Assistant Professor level, but senior candidates are also
encouraged to apply. All positions require completion of the PhD degree
by July 1, 2013 and a competitive record of research commensurate with 
rank. The successful candidate will be expected to teach and mentor 
undergraduate and graduate students within the department, including 
teaching both introductory and disciplinary courses, and to conduct a 
vigorous, externally-funded research program that involves post-
doctoral, graduate and undergraduate students. Case Western Reserve 
University is committed to Equal Opportunity and World Class Diversity.
Women, veterans, members of underrepresented minority groups, and 
individuals with disabilities are encouraged to apply. Case Western 
Reserve University is a past recipient of a National Science Foundation
ADVANCE Institutional Transformation Award to increase the 
participation of women in Science and Engineering.

Application Deadline: November 15, 2012.

AGU CHAPMAN CONFERENCE - CROSSING THE BOUNDARIES IN PLANETARY 
ATMOSPHERES: FROM EARTH TO EXOPLANETS

Annapolis, MD
June 24-28, 2013

http://chapman.agu.org/planetaryatmospheres/

This is a working meeting that emphasizes developing a common 
language, exchange of ideas, and planning for future collaborations 
among the Earth, planetary and exoplanetary science communities.  
Topics include:

1. What fundamental processes govern ALL atmospheres? Can they be 
applied uniformly in generalized dynamic, thermodynamic, and chemistry 
models, including non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (non-LTE) 
effects? What limitations of our current theories and models of Earth 
climate compromise their application to more extreme climates of the 
past and future, and to other planets?

2. Can planetary atmospheres be broken into classes or taxonomies with
commonalities in composition, structure, or dynamics?

3. How can insights from one field be adapted or extended to improve 
our knowledge in another field?

4. Are there community-specific observational and analysis techniques 
that can be applied to the other disciplines?

Contributed abstracts are solicited on the following topics:  
Preference for contributed talks will be given to those of  
cross-disciplinary nature:

* Atmospheric model development and applications
* Atmospheric theory
* Data acquisition, assimilation, and analysis
* Observational techniques and needs, ground and space-based
* Laboratory techniques and needs

exploration systems, lunar science, astrobiology, or astrophysics.

Applicants must have a Ph.D. or equivalent degree in hand before 
beginning the fellowship, but may apply while completing the degree 
requirements. U. S. citizens, Lawful Permanent Residents, and foreign 
nationals eligible for J-1 status as a Research Scholar may apply.

Stipends start at $53,500 per year, with supplements for high cost-
of-living areas and for certain academic specialties. Financial 
assistance is available for relocation and health insurance, and 
$8,000 per year is provided for professional travel.

Applications are accepted three times each year: March 1, July 1, and 
November 1.
