[NASA] ROSES-2012 AND SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION AVAILABLE

The 2012 omnibus solicitation Research Opportunities in Space and 
Earth Sciences (ROSES-12) has been released with PDFs, table links, 
due dates, and the new versions of the Guidebook for Proposers:

2012/
 
Proposers should be aware of the following significant changes from 
last year:
 
1. Public Law 112-55 prevents NASA from funding proposals with 
bilateral participation, collaboration, or coordination with China
(see GIC 12-01 in Section III (c) of the ROSES-12 Summary of
Solicitation).

2. Three new programs will be using a 2-Step submission process:
Geospace Science (Appendix B.3), Solar and Heliospheric Science 
(Appendix B.4), and Cassini Data Analysis and Participating Scientists 
(Appendix C.10) REQUIRE a Step-1 proposal (an enhanced NOI).

(Essential) Step-1 proposal due dates for the following programs:
Solar and Heliospheric Science - 03/16/2012
Cassini Data Analysis and Participating Scientist - 03/23/2012
Geospace Science - 04/13/2012
 
3. Please read Section II if you are interested in a Suborbital and 
Suborbital-Class Investigation.

FIFTH COSMIC DUST MEETING

The fifth Cosmic Dust meeting will be held on August 6-10, 2012 at 
the CPS (Center for Planetary Science), Kobe, Japan.

This series of Cosmic Dust meetings aims at finding a consensus among 
experts on the formation and evolution of cosmic dust: where it comes 
from and where it goes. All kinds of cosmic dust (intergalactic and 
interstellar dust, protoplanetary and debris disk dust, cometary, 
asteroidal, interplanetary and circumplanetary dust, stellar nebular 
condensates, presolar grains, micrometeorites, meteoroids, meteors 
regolith particles) are the subject of discussion. The meeting is open 
for any aspects of dust research by means of different methods of 
studies (in-situ and laboratory measurements, astronomical 
observations, laboratory and numerical analogue simulations, 
theoretical modeling, etc.). Publishing the proceedings of this meeting 
as a special issue of a peer-reviewed journal is currently being 
planned, while paper submission to the proceedings is not obligatory.

For further details, please visit the Cosmic Dust website at:

Please complete the online meeting application. Notice that the number 
of participants is limited.

NASA POSTDOCTORAL FELLOWSHIPS

The NASA Postdoctoral Program (NPP) offers scientists and engineers 
unique opportunities to conduct research at NASA Centers. Each NPP 
fellowship opportunity is designed to advance NASA research in a 
specific project related to space science, earth science, aeronautics, 
space operations, exploration systems, lunar science, or astrobiology.

Applicants must have a Ph.D. or equivalent degree in hand before 
beginning the fellowship, but may apply while completing the degree 
requirements. U. S. citizens, Lawful Permanent Residents, and foreign 
nationals eligible for J-1 status as a Research Scholar may apply.  
An H-1B Visa status is not acceptable because the NPP is not an 
employment program.

Stipends for Postdoctoral Fellows start at $50,000 per year, with 
moderate supplements for high cost-of-living areas and for certain 
academic specialties. Funds are available for relocation expenses, up 
to a specified limit, and health insurance is available through the 
program. Fellows also receive $8,000 per appointment year to support 
travel to conferences, meetings, and other activities that directly 
support their research.

Applications are accepted three times each year: March 1, July 1, 
and November 1.

2012 MRO/CRISM DATA USERS' WORKSHOP

The 2012 MRO/CRISM Data Users' Workshop will be held in association 
with the 43rd Lunar and Planetary Science Conference on Sunday, March 
18th, 2012 from 1:00 PM - 5:00 PM in Waterway 2-3 at The Woodlands 
Waterway Marriott Hotel and Convention Center, The Woodlands, Texas.

The 2009 CRISM Data Users' Workshop introduced the data set to the
community, described data products in detail, and trained attendees 
onmusing CRISM-specific software to analyze the data.  At this second
workshop, CRISM team members will review significant updates to
PDS-delivered CRISM data products including an update to the 
radiometric calibration, and the implementation of a data filtering 
procedure that reduces instrument noise. In addition, a new family of 
highly derived CRISM data products - the Map Projected Targeted Reduced 
Data Record (MTRDR) product set - will be detailed and the utility of 
this product suite for scientific investigations will be demonstrated. 
The MTRDR product set represents a major advance in the accessibility 
of CRISM-derived spectral information and is expected to become the 
CRISM product set of preference for a large portion of the scientific 
community.

All attendees are requested to register online for this event at:

A VISION OF DISCOVERY! WORKSHOP FOR K-12 EDUCATORS

NASA's Discovery and New Frontiers missions are exploring the solar 
system and sending back to Earth never-before-seen images. Workshop 
participants will get the latest updates on MESSENGER and Dawn, then 
learn how to use elements of art to engage students in analyzing and 
understanding NASA imagery. Focusing on photos of Mercury and Vesta but
applicable to all space images, discover techniques to help students 
"learn to look" and "look to learn" as they investigate planetary 
features.

The workshop will be held in 4 locations simultaneously - check website 
for local times.

When: Saturday, March 10 
Where: Pasadena, CA | Portland, OR | Houston, TX | Laurel, MD
Cost:  $25 (lunch and snacks included)

Speakers include Dr. Ralph McNutt - New Horizons, Dr Bonnie Buratti - 
Dawn, Dr. Nancy Chabot - MESSENGER, and Monica Aiello - planetary 
artist and educator.

RESEARCH SCIENTISTS: MARS PETROLOGY AND ORGANIC GEOCHEMISTRY

The Planetary Science Section at JPL, based in Pasadena, CA, will fill 
two positions for researchers in areas relevant to future Martian 
sample return missions.

The first position is for study in the area of mineralogy, petrology 
and/or meteoritics. The research is expected to further knowledge of 
petrogenetic processes throughout the Solar System. Advanced scientific 
knowledge of petrology, mineralogy, and/or meteoritics is expected. 


The second position is for a researcher within the area of organic 
geochemistry with a strong focus on geobiological and/or astro-
biological investigations. Themes of study are expected to include 
the origin and evolution of life on Earth, the study of extra-
terrestrial organic compounds, and/or the recognition of bio-
signatures in returned Solar System samples.

It is expected that both positions will pursue new mission and/or 
instrument opportunities. This pursuit will involve working closely 
with science and engineering teams at JPL to design Solar System 
sample return and planetary exploration missions and instrumentation.

they are received. 

JPL/Caltech is an equal opportunity/affirmative action employer.
