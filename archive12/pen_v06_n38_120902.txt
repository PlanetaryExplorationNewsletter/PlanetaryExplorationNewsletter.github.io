PLANETARY-RELATED COMMERCIAL ANNOUNCEMENTS TO BE ALLOWED ON A TRIAL 
BASIS IN PEN

PEN receives requests to announce commercial products, such as books,
other educational products, instruments, and even support for new 
businesses. We would like to try an experiment. Commercial 
announcements will be accepted for PEN editions through the end of this 
calendar year. Such announcements will be subject to the following 
requirements:

- 50 words maximum, title+text including a URL
- Be related to planetary science
- Include "Commercial:" in the subject line to 
  pen_editor@planetarynews.org, regardless of whether the source is an 
  individual, for-profit entity, or non-profit entity
- No attachments will be distributed

These announcements will not be archived. There will be no charge. 
They will be included in a special section after regular PEN 
announcements (see this edition). The editors reserve the right to 
modify any announcement to conform to PEN style standards. We also 
reserve the right not to publish any announcement.

After this trial period, we will survey PEN subscribers to determine 
whether they think commercial announcements are of value and should 
continue. We will also consider whether a fee for such announcements 
should be implemented as a means of controlling volume.

GSA INVITES APPLICATIONS FOR TWO STUDENT AWARDS

1. The Planetary Geology Division of the Geological Society of America 
invites applications for two student awards with upcoming deadlines.

The 2012 Eugene M. Shoemaker Impact Cratering Award is offered to 
undergraduate or graduate students, of any nationality, working in 
any country, in the disciplines of geology, geophysics, geochemistry, 
astronomy, or biology. The award, which will include $2500, is to be 
applied for the study of impact craters, either on Earth or on the 
other solid bodies in the solar system. For more information and 
application procedures, please see the PGD website: 

http://www.geosociety.org/pgd/awards.html#_shoemaker 

The application deadline is 14 September 2012.

2. Students who are current members of PGD, and who are presenting an 
abstract at the GSA Annual Meeting, are eligible to apply for a $500 
Student Travel Grant to help offset the cost of attending the GSA 
meeting. We award up to two of these grants each year on a competitive 
basis. For application details, please see the PGD website:

http://www.geosociety.org/pgd/awards.html#_travel

or contact PGD second vice-chair, Devon Burr (dburr1@utk.edu). The 
application deadline is 21 September 2012.

PHD STUDENT POSITION IN THE NETHERLANDS

PhD student position: combined high-pressure experimental and numerical 
study of the interior evolution of the planet Mercury

The Faculty of Earth and Life Sciences of VU University Amsterdam, 
The Netherlands: Deep Earth and Planetary Science research cluster, 
with visits to the Carnegie Institution Washington. 

Study the large-scale differentiation processes that led to the current 
surface make-up of Mercury, as derived from recent MESSENGER data, 
using an integrated approach: (1) high-pressure experiments to 
constrain end member models for the structure and composition of 
minerals crystallizing from a global magma ocean and (2) numerical 
modeling of Mercury interior evolution. Results will serve as baseline 
for further interpretation of MESSENGER data and ESA’s upcoming 
BepiColombo mission. 

Candidates should have completed their MSc studies in Earth or 
Planetary Science, Chemistry or Physics. Experience with either 
high-pressure experimentation or numerical modeling, and a good 
theoretical background are advantages. The appointment will be for 
1 year; after satisfactory evaluation, this can be extended to a total 
duration of 4 years (normal length of a PhD in the Netherlands). 
Details of salary, excellent fringe benefits, and of the application 
procedure, can be found at:

http://www.vu.nl/nl/werken-bij-de-vu/vacatures/2012/1.2012.00199.asp

Deadline for applications is September 10.
