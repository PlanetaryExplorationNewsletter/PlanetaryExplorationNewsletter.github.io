POSTDOCTORAL RESEARCHER: SECONDARY ION MASS SPECTROMETRY (SIMS)
MICROPROBE ANALYSIS

The Lunar and Planetary Institute (LPI), part of the Universities
Space Research Association, invites applications for a postdoctoral
fellowship in the area of SIMS isotopic and elemental analysis of
Martian meteorites.

The successful candidate will work with an international team at NASA
Johnson Space Center in Houston. Candidate should be self-motivated,
and must have a Ph.D. in geochemistry, cosmochemistry, or related.
Strong background in ion microprobe analysis essential. Experience
in analysis/interpretation of Pb isotopes is advantageous. Experience
with a Cameca 1270/80 is also advantageous. Knowledge of Martian
geochemistry and petrology is beneficial, but not essential. Travel
is required. Candidates should also present an independent research
plan that complements the Martian meteorite study.

Position is for one year, with possible extension to a second year.  
Applicants should send a letter of interest, a curriculum vita with
list of publications, a brief statement of research interests, and
three references to:

resume@lpi.usra.edu

Further details, contact:
Justin Simon (justin.i.simon@nasa.gov) or

GSA SESSION ON GULLIES IN THE LANDSCAPE: ABSTRACTS INVITED

Dear colleagues,

Paul Bierman and I are convening a session (T23) at the GSA Annual
Meeting in Charlotte in November on gully erosion.

This session addresses all aspects of gullying (on Earth or
elsewhere in the Solar System), including field and remote-sensing
studies of gully occurrence, mechanics of gully formation,
environmental and sedimentological consequences, engineering
challenges, and the relative roles of humans and natural forcing
factors.

http://www.geosociety.org/meetings/2012/sessions/topical.asp

Abstracts on any aspect of gully formation are welcome.

Due date: August 14, 2012

For further information, please contact me at:

NOMINATE YOUR COLLEAGUES FOR AGU AWARDS: JULY 15

The Whipple Award honors an individual who has made an outstanding
contribution in the field of planetary science. The award is named
after Fred Whipple, a gifted astronomer most noted for his work on
comets. Past awardees have spanned the breadth and depth of the
planetary sciences section.

The new Ronald Greeley Early Career Award in Planetary Science is being
awarded in 2012 for the first time. Nominees must be a member or
affiliate of the Planetary Sciences Section of AGU and must be within
6 years of receiving their Ph.D. on the first day of the year in which
the award is to be made (e.g. on or after 1 January 2006 for the 2012
award.) Parental leave can extend the six-year period.

Packages should include a current CV and publications list for the
nominee, and a nomination letter outlining the candidate's significant
contributions. The nomination should be accompanied by three to six
supporting letters from members of the AGU section.

Send nomination packages to:

Phil Christensen
Arizona State University
School of Earth and Space Exploration
Campus Box 6305
Tempe, AZ 85287-6305 USA

1ST INTERNATIONAL WORKSHOP ON LUNARCUBES

Flexure Engineering is creating the LunarCubes Working Group and
LunarCubes workshops to promote the creation of a standard to
facilitate the development of low cost, rapid development payloads that
easily could be added to the many Lunar opportunities that will arise
in the coming decades.

Workshop:
LunarCubes - The Next Frontier
October 4-6, 2012, Mountain View California
Call for Papers : June 1, 2012

ESLAB Symposium on "Formation and Evolution of Moons" that will be held
at ESTEC, Noordwijk, The Netherlands, 25-29 June 2012.

ESLAB is an annual meeting organized by the European Space Agencyâ€™s
Directorate of Science and Robotic Exploration Research and Scientific
Support Department.

The program, registration page, and information about accommodations
are now available at:

MARS2013 NORTHERN SAHARA MARS ANALOG FIELD SIMULATION

The Austrian Space Forum is preparing for a Mars Analog simulation in
the Northern Sahara in Morocco in February 2013, in cooperation with
the Ibn-Battuta Center at the University of Marrakesh.

We already have a series of indications of interest ranging from
NASA/JPL, several universities across the US and Europe, and Russian
institutions. We welcome other interested organizations, as well. We
also would like to point out the option of performing remote science
experiments either through our Mission Support Center in Austria or via
satellite link from your home institution during our simulation.

The closing deadline for abstract submission is 15 June 2012.  For
details, please see:

NASA POSTDOCTORAL FELLOWSHIPS

The NASA Postdoctoral Program (NPP) offers scientists and engineers
unique opportunities to conduct research at NASA Centers. Each NPP
fellowship opportunity is designed to advance NASA research in a
specific project related to space science, earth science, aeronautics,
exploration systems, lunar science, astrobiology, or astrophysics.

Applicants must have a Ph.D. or equivalent degree in hand before
beginning the fellowship, but may apply while completing the degree
requirements. U. S. citizens, Lawful Permanent Residents, and foreign
nationals eligible for J-1 status as a Research Scholar may apply.

Stipends start at $50,000 per year, with supplements for high
cost-of-living areas and for certain academic specialties. Financial
assistance is available for relocation and health insurance, and
$8,000 per year is provided for professional travel.

Applications are accepted three times each year: March 1, July 1, and
November 1.

UPDATE: NATIONAL PLANETARY EXPLORATION CAR WASH & BAKE SALE

A National Planetary Exploration Car Wash and Bake Sale is being 
planned for June 9th to attract media and Congressional attention to 
the perilous NASA planetary exploration cuts likely to take place 
1 October.

This event's purpose is to raise awareness to this problem in the 
public and in local media markets across the country by creating an 
opportunity for local media to interview planetary scientists about why 
it has come to washing cars and baking cookies to try to stop the cuts 
to planetary science. This is a grass roots effort, with individual 
groups taking personal action in their local communities on a common 
date. 

This event is not designed to actually raise funds. Any monies 
collected are meant only cover events costs.

Over twenty planetary groups are now involved, including those at: 
CalTech, LPL, LPI, Moon Express (Google Lunar X Prize), Notre Dame, 
PSI, SwRI, UCF, UCLA, and the University of Maryland.

June 9th can be found at:

EPSC2012 SESSION ON THE 2011 DRACONOIDS METEOR SHOWER

There will be a session dedicated to the exceptional 2011 Draconids
meteor shower at the EPSC2012 in Madrid in September 2012.

On 8 October 2011 around 20 UT, the Draconids displayed an exceptional
outburst, as predicted by several researcher teams. An international
observation campaign was organized for the event. It involved two
European research airplanes each carrying a dozen cameras, as well as
hundreds of ground-based observation stations. This session will
highlight the results of the campaign.
