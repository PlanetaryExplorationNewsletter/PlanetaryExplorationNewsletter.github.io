EDITORIAL: CONCERNS ABOUT PLANETARY R&A

Since December, Planetary Division Director James Green has been 
telling numerous community forums that Planetary Research and Analysis
programs were going to experience increased funding in FY12 over FY11. 
This was reinforced by the President's FY13 budget proposal that 
reports an expected increase of ~10% for these programs in FY12.

These programs have suffered since funds were removed in 2010, 
evidently to cover MSL cost overruns, and rephased to subsequent years 
without funds added back, resulting in lower than normal selection 
rates.
 
Declarations of additional funding for 2012 are countered by 
unexplained delays in new awards (e.g., OSS>300 days, PGG>286 days, 
MFR>251 days), messages to proposers by program officers of 
insufficient funds for new awards, and unofficial reports from HQ of 
significant cuts to research program budgets. Contrary to recent 
explanations offered by PSD management, Congress is not holding up 
funding for research programs as a consequence of the rejection of an 
amended operating plan.

At LPSC, I respectfully request Jim Green give a detailed breakdown of 
2012 research program element budgets (e.g., MDAP, PGG, etc.), 
compare them with 2011, and clarify the situation with numbers, 
not promises.

NASA HEADQUARTERS RESEARCH AND ANALYSIS (R&A) TOWN HALL MEETING

At LPSC, Monday, March 19, 12:00 to 1:15 p.m., Montgomery Ballroom

The Science Mission Directorate of NASA Headquarters will host an 
informal luncheon.

NASA BUDGET: DISCUSSION AND LETTER-WRITING SESSION AT LPSC

Many in the planetary science community and the general public have 
expressed concern over the proposed 21% cuts to NASA's planetary 
science program in the President's FY13 budget. Such changes could 
lead to a dramatic shift in priorities and tangible losses to our 
nation's unique capability to explore and study the solar system. As 
such, an informal group of young scientists was recently formed with 
the intention of discussing the proposed cuts, and taking action to 
protect and enrich the future of planetary science and exploration. 
We invite all members of the community (including foreign nationals) 
to a join us for an informal discussion and letter-writing session on 
Monday night in the "Grogan's Mill" room of the Woodlands Waterway 
Marriott, at 8:30 PM. Information will be available for those 
interested in contacting their congressional representatives and the 
NASA leadership.

Date/time: Monday, March 19, 8:30 PM
Location: Grogan's Mill room, Woodlands Waterway Marriott, TX

For more information, or to submit ideas in writing, please contact

TIME CHANGE - LUNAR SWIRLS LUNCHTIME MEETING AT LPSC

Due to an important and conflicting lunchtime meeting on Tuesday, the 
Swirls Meeting has been moved to 5:00 pm. Day and location remain the 
same (see below). We will try to keep the meeting shorter than the 
allotted time so you have time to grab dinner before the poster 
session begins.

LUNAR SWIRLS MEETING DETAILS
Date: Tue 03/20/2012
Start Time: 5:00 PM
End Time: 6:00 PM
Room: Panther Creek

[NASA] OPAG MEETING 29-30 MARCH 2012, ST. LOUIS

The NASA Outer Planets Assessment Group (OPAG) will meet in less than 
2 weeks at the Renaissance Grand St. Louis Hotel, in downtown St. 
Louis, Missouri.  
 
Potential attendees, even local attendees, are asked to go to the 
following website, and click on the invitation link and RSVP for 
attendance (this assists our meeting planners). An updated agenda also 
can be found at:

THIRD CONFERENCE ON TERRESTRIAL MARS ANALOGUES

25 - 27 October, 2012 Marrakech Morocco
Pre- and Post-conference field trips
The second circular available on the conference web site:

http://www.ibnbattutacentre.org/conf/mars2012/

Organised by: European Space Agency, International Association of 
Sedimentologists, Italian Space Agency, Ibn Battuta Centre, IRSPS. 

This is the third conference on Mars analogue studies. The first two 
were held at Catania (Italy) in 2002 and at Trento (Italy) in 2007. 
Since the Trento Conference the interest in Mars analogues has 
increased enormously. The analysis of Mars analogue environments on 
Earth is of paramount importance for the interpretation of the data 
from past, present and future orbital and landed missions, as well as 
mission planning.

ULTRAVIOLET ASTRONOMY: HST AND BEYOND

This is the second announcement for the upcoming conference: UV 
Astronomy: HST and Beyond to be held June 18-21 on the island of Kauai.
Ultraviolet Astronomy: HST and Beyond will review the current forefront 
in UV astronomy, and look to the future, identifying the science cases 
and instrumentation needs for the next generation of instruments, 
small, medium and large. We have a series of invited review talks on 
scientific and observational topics, and invite contributions on the 
latest results in ultraviolet astrophysics, technological developments, 
and future mission concepts. 

The deadline for submitting contributions is March 31, 2012. If you

NASA POSTDOCTORAL FELLOWSHIPS

The NASA Postdoctoral Program (NPP) offers scientists and engineers 
unique opportunities to conduct research at NASA Centers. Each NPP 
fellowship opportunity is designed to advance NASA research in a 
specific project related to space science, earth science, aeronautics, 
exploration systems, lunar science, astrobiology, or astrophysics.

Applicants must have a Ph.D. or equivalent degree in hand before 
beginning the fellowship, but may apply while completing the degree 
requirements. U. S. citizens, Lawful Permanent Residents, and foreign 
nationals eligible for J-1 status as a Research Scholar may apply.

Stipends start at $50,000 per year, with supplements for high 
cost-of-living areas and for certain academic specialties. Financial 
assistance is available for relocation and health insurance, and 
$8,000 per year is provided for professional travel.

MOVING FORWARD IN SPACE WORKSHOP

Applications are now available for the Moving FORWARD in Space 
Workshop, to be held in Philadelphia on June 4-6, 2012.

The primary goals of the workshop are to provide early-career female 
scientists with information and skills development necessary for a 
successful bid for a tenured professorship in the planetary sciences. 
Workshop activities will focus on developing mentoring and networking 
connections, techniques for more successful writing, acquiring grant 
funding, sharing of classroom ideas and materials, maintaining work-
life balance, and challenges for dual career couples.

More information is available on the website at: 

https://sites.google.com/a/temple.edu/forward-in-space/

Applications are available on the website or by e-mailing 
planetary@temple.edu.  Applications must be received by midnight 
March 26, 2012.  The workshop Organizing Committee will review 
applications and begin informing applicants on April 2.  Applications 
for travel stipends will also be available at that time. 

This conference is sponsored by the National Science Foundation via 
the FORWARD to Professorship Program.
