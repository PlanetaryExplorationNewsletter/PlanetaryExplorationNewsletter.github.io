Last Chance to View Venus Transit Our Sun!
 
The transit of Venus across our Sun for about 7 hours (begining 
6:09 PM Eastern US on June 5th) is an astronomical event that will not 
occur again until 2117. To take advantage of the transit, NASA will be 
filming and archiving the transit from the Solar Dynamic Observatory, 
Hubble Space Telescope, International Space Station, Mauna Kea, and 
live from locations around the globe. To find out more about over 350 
events, Venus tran­sit educational materials, videos, and tips on safe
solar viewing, visit:

You are encouraged to register your own event and join the fun telling 
the public about planetary science. To watch the planned events LIVE 
from around the globe, watch NASA TV or live web­streams a:t
