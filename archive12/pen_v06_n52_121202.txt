CALL FOR PAPERS EGU

ST2.4/PS3.3 Session "Radiation Belts: Earth and Outer Planets" 
(Joint Solar-Terrestrial and Planetary & Solar System Session) 

European Geophysical Union General Assembly, Vienna, Austria, 
7-12 April 2013 

This session aims to discuss recent and anticipated progress in 
radiation belt research. We solicit presentations on the effects 
of global magnetospheric processes and local wave-particle 
interactions on radiation belt dynamics, as well as on aspects of 
belt coupling with the ring current and the plasmasphere. Of 
particular interest is the relative impact of various electromagnetic 
waves for particle acceleration, transport, and loss. The session is 
especially timely because of ongoing European research funded by the 
Seventh Framework Programmes (e.g., SPACECAST and MAARBLE projects) 
and the anticipated first results of NASA's Radiation Belt Storm 
Probes (RBSP) mission. Also, papers on similar processes operating 
in the radiation belts of the outer planets are especially welcome.

The abstract submission deadline: 9 January 2013.
Support application deadline: 30 November 2013.

Abstract submission guidelines:

AN ARTICLE ON ASTRONOMICALLY INSPIRED MUSIC

A new annotated resource guide presenting 133 pieces of music inspired 
by astronomical ideas (organized into 22 subject categories) has just 
been published in the on-line journal Astronomy Education Review and 
is available free at:

http://aer.aas.org/resource/1/aerscz/v11/i1/p010303_s1?view=fulltext

Both classical and popular music are included, and a short appendix 
lists a number of astronomers who have recorded songs and self-
published them. If you can't immediately name the six songs that 
include valid information or ideas about black holes, this is the 
list you want to consult.

PHD OPPORTUNITY IN PHYSICAL VOLCANOLOGY (LAVA EROSION MODELING) AT 
ARIZONA STATE UNIVERSITY

I have funding for one Ph.D. student starting in the Fall 2013
semester. This funding is for a research assistantship for at least
2 years, and possibly up to 4 years (either teaching assistantship or
research assistanship), to develop new mathematical computer models
to investigate erosion by flowing lava on the Moon, Mars, and Earth.
I am seeking a student interested in developing model(s) to focus on
modeling mechanical erosion by lava in various planetary environments, 
and/or the case of erosion by dense submarine ultramafic komatiitic 
basalt lava flows that burrow into and thermo-mechanically erode 
water-saturated submarine sea-floor sediments.

If you are interested in this project, I encourage you to apply to
our graduate program. ASU Graduate School applications for the Fall
2013 semester are due on December 15, 2012.  For more information,
please go to:  

http://sese.asu.edu/prospective_grads

Interested potential applicants are encouraged to meet with me at the
Fall AGU meeting in San Francisco next week.  For further information, 
please contact Professor David Williams at: <David.Williams@asu.edu>

HABITABLE WORLDS ACROSS SPACE AND TIME

First Announcement: The 2013 STScI Spring Symposium
April 29 - May 2, 2013

Abstract submission deadline: March 15, 2013
On-line registration deadline: March 29, 2013

Within a matter of years, humanity will know for the first time the 
frequency of terrestrial planets in orbit around other stars. This 
knowledge will pave the way for joining research from astronomy, Earth 
science, and biology to understand the past, present, and future of 
the Earth within its larger context as one of many habitable worlds. 
Such work seeks to understand the formation and fate of the Earth as 
well as predict where and when different bodies will be suitable for 
life.

In this four-day symposium, scientists from diverse fields will 
discuss the formation and long-term evolution of terrestrial bodies 
throughout the various phases of stellar and Galactic evolution. A 
particular focus will be in how the specific conditions and challenges 
for habitability on Earth extend to other bodies in the Solar System 
and beyond. The existence of these overlooked environments may 
provide motivation for novel astronomical observations with existing 
and next generation ground and space-based observatories.

Release Date:  11/26/12
Response Date:  1/7/13
Recovery and Reinvestment Act Action:  No
Classification Code:  A - Research and Development
Issued by:  Science Mission Directorate

The goal of the overall study is to gather and assess concepts for 
possible utilization of the recently acquired systems for Agency goals 
aligned with 5 principal areas; space technology, human exploration 
and operations, heliophysics, planetary science, and astrophysics 
(excluding an infrared wide field survey). The SALSO activity consists 
of a managed workshop and follow-on study of concepts flowing from 
the workshop process. NASA encourages submission of concepts that 
address multiple NASA objectives (above); make innovative use of NASA 
capabilities and/or anticipated commercial services; and/or incorporate 
innovative processes or partnership arrangements.

[NASA] KEPLER PARTICIPATING SCIENTIST PROGRAM

The Kepler Participating Scientist Program (PSP) is designed to fund 
community investigations that advance the goals of the Kepler Mission 
during its extended phase. Participating Scientists may pursue data 
processing and analysis tasks, exoplanet candidate follow-up 
observations, completeness and reliability studies, characterization 
of the stellar target sample, etc.

The Kepler PSP is complementary to, but distinct from, the Kepler 
Guest Observer (GO) program. 

NOIs are requested by January 18, 2013.
Proposal due date is March 1, 2013.

Technical questions regarding the Kepler extended mission and key
science project activities may be directed to: Dr. Steve Howell,
