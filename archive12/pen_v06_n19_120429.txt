EXOPLANETS IN MULTI-BODY SYSTEMS IN THE KEPLER ERA

February 9-16, 2013
Aspen Center for Physics, Aspen, CO, USA

http://www.astro.ufl.edu/~eford/meetings/aspen2013/ 

For centuries, theories of planet formation were guided exclusively by 
our solar system. However, the discovery of planets orbiting other 
stars (exoplanets) has demonstrated that nature often produces 
planetary systems quite different from our own, neither anticipated by 
nor well explained by the current theories of solar system formation 
and dynamics. 

In this one week program, scientists from the fields of planetary 
science, celestial mechanics, astronomy and astrophysics will meet to 
discuss new developments in the field of extrasolar multi-planet 
systems. Our workshop will provide an environment where these 
scientists can present new ideas, discuss their implications for 
identifying the most important problems in the field and chart the 
fieldâ€™s future direction.

The meeting will be held either February 9-15 or February 10-16, 2013.  
We anticipate nearly 100 participants. The Aspen Center for Physics 
will coordinate applications, registration and housing.  We will 
update the meeting website with information as these details become 
available. See the ACP website for further information about 
registration, housing and day care for previous winter meetings.  
Young scientists, women and underrepresented minorities are all 
encouraged to apply.

POSTDOCTORAL RESEARCH: SECONDARY ION MASS SPECTROMETRY (SIMS) 
MICROPROBE ANALYSIS

The Lunar and Planetary Institute (LPI), part of the Universities 
Space Research Association, invites applications for a postdoctoral 
fellowship in the area of SIMS isotopic and elemental analysis of 
Martian meteorites.

The successful candidate will work with an international team at NASA 
Johnson Space Center in Houston. Candidate should be self-motivated, 
and must have a Ph.D. in geochemistry, cosmochemistry, or related.  
Strong background in ion microprobe analysis essential. Experience in 
analysis/interpretation of Pb isotopes is advantageous. Experience with 
a Cameca 1270/80 is also advantageous. Knowledge of Martian 
geochemistry and petrology is beneficial, but not essential. Travel is 
required. Candidates should also present an independent research plan 
that complements the Martian meteorite study. 

Position is for one year, with possible extension to a second year.  
Applicants should send a letter of interest, a curriculum vita with 
list of publications, a brief statement of research interests, and 
three references to resume@lpi.usra.edu. Further details contact 
Justin Simon (justin.i.simon@nasa.gov) or John Jones 
(john.h.jones@nasa.gov). Information on research and facilities at 
the LPI can be found at:

http://www.lpi.usra.edu  

Information on JSC facilities can be found at:

The Universities Space Research Association is an Equal Opportunity 
Employer.

NASA POSTDOCTORAL FELLOWSHIPS

The NASA Postdoctoral Program (NPP) offers scientists and engineers 
unique opportunities to conduct research at NASA Centers. Each NPP 
fellowship opportunity is designed to advance NASA research in a 
specific project related to space science, earth science, aeronautics, 
exploration systems, lunar science, astrobiology, or astrophysics.

Applicants must have a Ph.D. or equivalent degree in hand before 
beginning the fellowship, but may apply while completing the degree 
requirements. U. S. citizens, Lawful Permanent Residents, and foreign 
nationals eligible for J-1 status as a Research Scholar may apply.

Stipends start at $50,000 per year, with supplements for high 
cost-of-living areas and for certain academic specialties. Financial 
assistance is available for relocation and health insurance, and 
$8,000 per year is provided for professional travel.

Applications are accepted three times each year: March 1, July 1, and 
November 1.

NASA LUNAR SCIENCE FORUM: THIRD ANNOUNCEMENT

The NASA Lunar Science Institute is pleased to announce the 5th annual 
NASA Lunar Science Forum, to be held July 17-19, 2012. This year's 
forum will feature sessions on in-depth scientific results from several 
missions: Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO); Acceleration, 
Reconnection, Turbulence and Electrodynamics of the Moon's Interaction 
with the Sun (ARTEMIS); Lunar Atmosphere and Dust Environment Explorer 
(LADEE); and Gravity Recovery And Interior Laboratory (GRAIL). We also 
will have a dedicated side-conference for graduate students and young 
lunar professionals, NASA Night with NASA HQ leadership, as well as the 
annual Shoemaker Award ceremony and associated keynote lecture. As in 
past years, science sessions are structured to report on both recent 
results and future opportunities for lunar science, exploration, 
education and outreach. 
 
Abstracts, with a 4800 character limit, are currently being accepted 
through 23:59:59, May 1, 2012 PDT.

Student travel support is available to those students who would not 
otherwise be able to attend the Forum.  Details on the main site listed 
above. 
 
Thank you all! We look forward to another exciting meeting focusing on 
science of, on and from the Moon!

THIRD ANNUAL LUNGRADCON 2012

The 3rd Annual Lunar Graduate Conference (LunGradCon 2012) will be held 
on Saturday/Sunday, July 14-15, 2012 at the NASA Ames Research Center 
(ARC), preceding the NASA Lunar Science Forum. LunGradCon provides an 
opportunity for grad students and early-career postdocs to present 
their research on lunar science in a low-stress, friendly environment, 
being critiqued only by their peers. In addition to oral presentations, 
the conference presents opportunities for networking with fellow grad 
students and postdocs, as well as senior members of the NASA Lunar 
Science Institute. A limited amount of funding will be provided for 
travel and lodging costs.

2012 NEXT GENERATION LUNAR SCIENTISTS & ENGINEERS WORKSHOP

The 3rd annual Next Generation Lunar Scientists & Engineers (NGLSE) 
Workshop will be held on Monday, July 16, 2012 at the NASA Ames 
Research Center (ARC), preceding the NASA Lunar Science Forum. This 
one-day workshop for graduate students and early career professionals 
offers the opportunity for participants to network with other 
students/early career professionals, and will specifically include a 
media training workshop. The purpose of this group is to engage and 
develop the next generation of lunar scientists and engineers, and to 
enable their successful involvement in current planning for the 
exploration of the Moon.

COMMUNITY INPUT REQUESTED ON THE CONCEPTS FOR PLANETARY SCIENCE FROM A 
BALLOON-BASED OBSERVATORY

NASA's Planetary Science Division is seeking community input on the 
potential planetary science that could be achieved from a stratospheric 
balloon observatory. A workshop to discuss platform capabilities, 
recent balloon missions for other NASA SMD divisions, and potential 
planetary science applications was held at NASA GRC in late January, 
2012.  Efforts to date have resulted in over 40 concepts for planetary 
science this platform may perform.

The next phase of this effort is to solicit review and comments from 
the broader planetary community. Your participation is crucial to 
ensure that the ideas put forward are the best they can be and are 
reflective of the needs and desires of the broad planetary community.  

To review the information relevant to your science interests and 
provide comments, suggestions, and new ideas, by COB April 30th, 
please go to: 

http://www.lpi.usra.edu/balloon_science/ 

Thank you in advance for you participation.

PLANETARY LANDSCAPES FACEBOOK PAGE

On April 19, 2012, a new page, Planetary Landscapes, was created on 
Facebook. Planetary Landscapes is managed at the SETI Institute as part 
of the community effort to advocate for, and support Planetary 
Exploration. It is a public site. After only 4 days of existence, 
Planetary Landscapes had reached close to 23,000 individual IPs, 
showing the incredible demand and interest of the public. With every 
additional IP that we reach, every new "Like", we increase awareness 
about planetary sciences, knowledge, and the spirit of human 
exploration. Visit the site, spread the word, and help us as a 
community make a huge statement.
