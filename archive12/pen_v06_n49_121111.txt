TENURE-TRACK POSITION, CASE WESTERN RESERVE UNIVERSITY

The Department of Earth, Environmental, and Planetary Sciences at 
Case Western Reserve University seeks candidates for a tenure-track 
faculty growth position. We seek outstanding candidates who will 
complement existing departmental strengths in planetary sciences, 
geochemistry, and surficial processes.  It is anticipated that the 
position will be filled at the Assistant Professor level, but senior 
candidates are also encouraged to apply. All positions require 
completion of the PhD degree by July 1, 2013 and a competitive record 
of research commensurate with rank. The successful candidate will be 
expected to teach and mentor undergraduate and graduate students within
the department, including teaching both introductory and disciplinary 
courses, and to conduct a vigorous, externally-funded research program 
that involves post-doctoral, graduate and undergraduate students.
Case Western Reserve University is committed to Equal Opportunity and 
World Class Diversity.  Women, veterans, members of underrepresented 
minority groups, and individuals with disabilities are encouraged to 
apply. Case Western Reserve University is a past recipient of a 
National Science Foundation ADVANCE Institutional Transformation Award
to increase the participation of women in Science and Engineering.

Application Deadline is November 15, 2012.

[NASA] EARTH AND SPACE SCIENCE FELLOWSHIP (NESSF) PROGRAM

NASA announces a call for graduate fellowship proposals to the NASA
Earth and Space Science Fellowship (NESSF) program for the 2013-2014
academic year. This call for fellowship proposals solicits applications
from accredited U.S. universities on behalf of individuals pursuing
Master of Science (M.Sc.) or Doctoral (Ph.D.) degrees in Earth and 
space sciences, or related disciplines. The purpose of NESSF is to 
ensure continued training of a highly qualified workforce in 
disciplines needed to achieve NASA's scientific goals. Awards 
resulting from the competitive selection will be made in the form of 
training grants to the respective universities.

Deadline for NEW applications: February 1, 2013 
Deadline for RENEWAL applications: March 15, 2013

The NESSF call for proposals and submission instructions are located 
at:

click on "Solicitations" - "Open Solicitations" - "NESSF 13"  

All proposals must be submitted in electronic format only through the
NASA NSPIRES system. Extended instructions on how to submit an 
electronic proposal package are posted on the NESSF 13
solicitation index page listed above.

[NASA] NEW OPPORTUNITY IN ROSES-12: MAVEN PARTICIPATING SCIENTIST 
PROGRAM

This solicitation is for investigations in the Participating Scientist 
program to enhance the scientific return from the Mars Atmosphere and 
Volatile EvolutioN (MAVEN) mission

http://lasp.colorado.edu/home/maven/ 

by broadening participation in the mission, augmenting the existing 
science team to include new investigations that broaden and/or 
complement the funded investigations, thus maximizing the contribution 
of the mission to the scientific understanding and future exploration 
of Mars. The second and equally important goal of this opportunity is 
to increase the number of scientists supporting mission planning and 
execution. While a large fraction of the planned observations will be 
planned in advance, real-time response to a brand-new set of 
observations is expected to result in an ongoing requirement for 
significant replanning. Additional investigators will contribute 
substantially to enhanced understanding of the data and to improved 
planning stimulated by the observations. Participating Scientist 
proposals can include investigations that are instrument specific or 
involve multiple instruments and, in all cases, must include both 
science analysis and a commitment to participate in operations 
planning in order to be considered.

NOIs due: January 11, 2013
Proposals due: March 1, 2013

NASA EUROPA WEBSITE

Four centuries ago, Galileo's discovery of Jupiter's moons helped to 
forever change our view of the universe. Today one of these moons - 
Europa - has the potential for discoveries just as profound. The 
Europa web site:

solarsystem.nasa.gov/europa

is a repository of pictures, movies, and information, including the 
Europa Study 2012 report describing NASA Flagship mission concepts.

TENURE-TRACK POSITION, BOSTON UNIVERSITY

The Department of Earth and Environment at Boston University invites
applications for a tenure-track position at the Assistant Professor
level in the broad field of Solid Earth Geophysics, starting July 1,
2013. We seek an applicant whose research emphasizes quantitative study
of the Earth's lithosphere and mantle at either a regional or a global
scale. Fields of study might include, but are not limited to, rock and
mineral physics, seismology, geodynamics, tectonophysics, and marine
geophysics. We encourage applications from individuals who employ
field-based, experimental, or computational methods in their research.

We seek an applicant whose research complements departmental expertise
in seismology, geodynamics, geochemistry and surface processes. Details
at:

https://academicjobsonline.org/ajo/jobs/2245

Review of applications will begin on January 1, 2013. Women and 
underrepresented minorities are particularly encouraged to apply. 
Boston University is an equal opportunity/affirmative action employer.

Note from submitter Paul Withers - The scope of this search is
sufficiently broad to include planetary geophysics.
