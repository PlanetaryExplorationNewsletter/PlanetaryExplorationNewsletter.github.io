[NASA] PROPOSALS SOLICITED FOR USE OF KECK TELESCOPES

NASA is soliciting proposals to use the Keck Telescopes for the 2013A 
observing semester (February 2013 - July 2013).  
 
Use of the Keck telescopes will be highly strategic in support of on-
going space missions and/or high priority, long term science goals.  
NASA Keck time is open to a wide range of disciplines including 
exoplanets and solar system topics, galactic, and extragalactic topics, 
cosmology and high energy astrophysics.  

There is limited time for observations based on public Kepler data or 
data obtained through the Kepler Guest Observer programs.  Proposals 
are also sought in: (1) investigations in support of EXOPLANET 
EXPLORATION science goals and missions; (2) investigations of our own 
SOLAR SYSTEM; (3) investigations in support of COSMIC ORIGINS science 
goals and missions; (4) investigations in support of PHYSICS OF THE 
COSMOS science goals and missions; and (5) direct MISSION SUPPORT.

The proposal process is being handled by the NASA Exoplanet Science 
Institute (NExScI) at Caltech and all proposals are due on 13    
September 2012 at 4 pm PDT.  For further information and proposal 
submission, please see:

NASA CONTRACTOR SEEKS SCIENTIST FOR ROSES PROGRAM MANAGEMENT/TECHNICAL 
SUPPORT

SDSE, the contractor to NASAâ€™s Science Mission Directorate (SMD) that 
supports peer review, is seeking a (preferably PhD) Scientist to 
conduct the day-to-day management of PSD ROSES programs. Subjects 
include Planetary Atmospheres, Chemistry, Geology and Spectroscopy, 
especially but not limited to the Saturnian System, as well as 
laboratory, observational and theoretical studies of the formation of 
our Solar System and other planetary systems. For more information see:

PLANETARY GEOPHYSICS POSTDOCTORAL FELLOWSHIP

The Universities Space Research Association's Lunar and Planetary 
Institute (LPI), in Houston Texas, invites applications for a 
postdoctoral fellowship in planetary geophysics.

The successful candidate will work with Dr. Walter Kiefer on a 
NASA-funded project studying the nature of mantle convection on Mars 
and its effects on the thermal evolution and volcanic history of the 
planet. The candidate will also have the opportunity to conduct 
research in planetary geophysics of his or her own choosing.

The position requires a Ph.D. in Planetary Science or Geophysics with 
experience in computer programming and numerical modeling methods, 
particularly finite elements. Experience with parallel computing in a 
Linux environment will be an asset. The position will be offered for 
an initial period of two years with a possible extension to a maximum 
of three years.

Applicants should send a letter of interest, a curriculum vita listing 
relevant publications, a brief (maximum three pages) statement of 
research interests, and a list of three references to 
resume@lpi.usra.edu. Further information about LPI can be found at:

VOLCANO-LITHOSPHERE INTERACTIONS ON THE TERRESTRIAL PLANETS 
POSTDOCTORAL FELLOWSHIP: LUNAR AND PLANETARY INSTITUTE

The Universities Space Research Association - Houston invites 
applications for a postdoctoral fellowship in geophysical studies of 
the growth/evolution of large volcanic edifices and provinces on the 
terrestrial planets.

The candidate will work with Dr. Patrick McGovern exploring mechanical 
interactions between intrusive and extrusive volcanic edifice growth, 
lithospheric flexural response, and magma ascent, using numerical 
modeling techniques, including Finite Element (FEM) and Distinct 
Element (DEM) Methods. Research will also entail analysis of imagery, 
topography, gravity, and spectral datasets for large planetary 
volcanoes in order to constrain the modeling efforts.  Potential bodies 
of interest include Venus, Io, the Moon, Earth, and Mars.

Requirements are a recent Ph.D. in geophysics or geology. Experience 
quantitative modeling of geophysical, geological, or magmatic 
processes with advanced codes as COMSOL Multiphysics (FEM) and PFC 
(DEM). Programming languages, MATLAB or FORTRAN 95 desirable. The 
position is two years with a possible extension to three years.

Send letter of interest, curriculum vita with a list of relevant 
publications, brief statement of research interests, and three 
references to resume@lpi.usra.edu. Further information may be found 
at:

beginning the fellowship, but may apply while completing the degree 
requirements. U. S. citizens, Lawful Permanent Residents, and foreign 
nationals eligible for J-1 status as a Research Scholar may apply.

Stipends start at $53,500 per year, with supplements for high cost-
of-living areas and for certain academic specialties. Financial 
assistance is available for relocation and health insurance, and 
$8,000 per year is provided for professional travel.

Applications are accepted three times each year: March 1, July 1, 
and November 1.

American Astronomical Society. Notices of intent to propose are still 
requested by August 24, 2012.
 
This Amendment to the NASA Research Announcement NNH12ZDA001N will be 
posted on the NASA research opportunity homepage at:
