RESOURCES FOR ADDRESSING STUDENT AND PUBLIC FEARS ABOUT ASTRONOMICAL
CAUSES FOR THE END OF THE WORLD IN 2012

As students return to school this fall and the media and web hype about
Doomsday 2012 reaches a final, fevered pitch, all of us in science
education will need to be prepared to respond to concerns from those 
who are genuinely worried or confused.

Two new resources are now available for educators, parents, youth group 
leaders, and science communicators to address fears that world-wide 
disaster is coming on Dec. 21, 2012:

A guide to accessible written and audio-visual materials (most of them 
freely available on the Web) has just been published in the journal 
"Astronomy Education Review":

http://dx.doi.org/10.3847/AER2012021

A video recording of the plenary session "Doomsday 2012 and 
Cosmophobia" at this summer's meeting of the Astronomical Society of 
the Pacific has now been posted by NASA's Lunar Science Institute at:

http://lunarscience.nasa.gov/articles/cosmophobia/

The panel, held Aug. 7, 2012 in Tucson, Arizona, includes astronomers, 
educators, and an expert on Mayan civilization. Panelists examine some 
of the key claims about end-of-the-world predictions and the more 
general idea of "cosmophobia" - fear of celestial events and
phenomena. And they answer questions from educators in the audience.

obtaining research funding is highly desirable. The appointment will 
begin fall 2013. Applications should consist of the following: cover 
letter, current resume including publication record, statement of 
research interests and plans (up to 5 pages), statement of teaching 
interests and approach (up to 3 pages), and names and complete 
contact information (including email addresses) of three references. 
Application materials must be submitted electronically by email as a 
single file in editable PDF format to: 

http://spacesciencesearch@wuphys.wustl.edu

NASA POSTDOCTORAL FELLOWSHIPS

The NASA Postdoctoral Program (NPP) offers scientists and engineers 
unique opportunities to conduct research at NASA Centers. Each NPP 
fellowship opportunity is designed to advance NASA research in a 
specific project related to space science, earth science, aeronautics, 
exploration systems, lunar science, astrobiology, or astrophysics.

Applicants must have a Ph.D. or equivalent degree in hand before 
beginning the fellowship, but may apply while completing the degree 
requirements. U. S. citizens, Lawful Permanent Residents, and foreign 
nationals eligible for J-1 status as a Research Scholar may apply.

Stipends start at $53,500 per year, with supplements for high 
cost-of-living areas and for certain academic specialties. Financial 
assistance is available for relocation and health insurance, and 
$8,000 per year is provided for professional travel.

Applications are accepted three times each year: March 1, July 1, and 
November 1.

VOLCANO-LITHOSPHERE INTERACTIONS ON THE TERRESTRIAL PLANETS 
POSTDOCTORAL FELLOWSHIP: LUNAR AND PLANETARY INSTITUTE

The Universities Space Research Association - Houston invites 
applications for a postdoctoral fellowship in geophysical studies of 
the growth/evolution of large volcanic edifices and provinces on the 
terrestrial planets.

The candidate will work with Dr. Patrick McGovern exploring mechanical 
interactions between intrusive and extrusive volcanic edifice growth, 
lithospheric flexural response, and magma ascent, using numerical 
modeling techniques, including Finite Element (FEM) and Distinct 
Element (DEM) Methods. Research will also entail analysis of imagery, 
topography, gravity, and spectral datasets for large planetary 
volcanoes in order to constrain the modeling efforts.  Potential 
bodies of interest include Venus, Io, the Moon, Earth, and Mars.

Requirements are a recent Ph.D. in geophysics or geology. Experience 
quantitative modeling of geophysical, geological, or magmatic processes 
with advanced codes as COMSOL Multiphysics (FEM) and PFC (DEM). 
Programming languages, MATLAB or FORTRAN 95 desirable. The position is 
two years with a possible extension to three years.
