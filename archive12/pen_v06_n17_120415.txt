CALL TO ACTION! CONTACT CONGRESS TO RESTORE THE NASA PLANETARY BUDGET!

Over the next two weeks, House and Senate subcommittees will be marking
up the NASA budget. We need to engage Congress to restore the 
devastating cuts to the NASA planetary budget  proposed by the 
Administration for FY13 and beyond. Go to:

http://dps.aas.org/news/time-action

for contact information and detailed talking points. Talking points 
are also available at:

http://planetarypolicy.org/talking_points.pdf
http://www.psi.edu/position/mars_restoration.html

If the NASA planetary budget can be restored to its FY12 level and 
kept flat at that level, NASA should be able to implement most of the
highest priority recommendations of the recent NRC Planetary Decadal 
Survey (i.e., R&A and Technology Development support, support for 
continuing missions, putting Discovery on a 24 month call), begin a 
restoration of the Mars exploration program (excluding multi-decade 
surface sample return), and allow for starting a possible Outer Planets
flagship mission in several years if the economy improves.

[NASA] PLANNING GROUP TAKES KEY STEPS FOR FUTURE MARS EXPLORATION

NASA's Mars Program Planning Group (MPPG), established
to assist the agency in developing a new strategy for the exploration
of the Red Planet, has begun analyzing options for future robotic
missions and enlisting the assistance of scientists and engineers
worldwide.

NASA is reformulating the Mars Exploration Program to be responsive to
high-priority science goals and the President's challenge of sending
humans to Mars in the 2030s.

Ideas and abstracts may be submitted online as part of NASA's effort
to seek out the best and the brightest ideas from researchers and
engineers in planetary science. Selected abstracts will be presented
during a workshop in June hosted by the Lunar and Planetary Institute
in Houston.

These ideas will inform a strategy for exploration within available 
resources, beginning as early as 2018 and stretching into the next 
decade and beyond.

The new strategy also will be designed to maintain America's critical
technical skills, developed over decades, to achieve the highest
priority science and exploration objectives.

The call for abstracts and workshop information, are at:

National Planetary Exploration Car Wash & Bake Sale

To attract media and Congressional attention to the perilous NASA 
planetary exploration cuts proposed to take place 1 October, and the 
need to restore the planetary budget to FY12 or higher levels, a
National Planetary Exploration Car Wash and Bake Sale is being planned 
for June 9th. 

Planetary groups and institutions are invited to join, sponsoring 
their own event locally and inviting media coverage to their event.

Those already involved include planetary groups at: LPL, LPI, Moon 
Express (Google Lunar X Prize), Notre Dame, PSI, SwRI, UCF, UCLA, 
and the University of Maryland.

More about the National Planetary Exploration Car Wash and Bake
Sale on June 9th can be found at:

http://www.boulder.swri.edu/~con/June9/PlanetaryCarWash.html

and at our Facebook page at:

https://www.facebook.com/NationalPlanetaryExplorationCarWashBakeSaleDay

Please consider organizing a local event of your own for June 9th, and
registering it at the URL above. 

For more information, contact the Alan Stern, astern@swri.edu, 
nationwide coordinator for the National Planetary Exploration Car Wash 
and Bake Sale.

http://astrogeology.usgs.gov/groups/Planetary-Data-Workshop

We are pleased to announce Planetary Data: A Workshop for Users and 
Software Developers to be held June 25-29, 2012, at Northern Arizona 
University (NAU) in Flagstaff, Arizona.  The meeting facility is at 
the du Bois Conference Center on the NAU campus. The two content 
tracks will share a common day on Wednesday to hold talks of 
overlapping interest. One or both tracks can be attended and there is 
no registration fee for either. 

Abstract submissions are due by April 30, 2012.

Planetary Data Users Track
* Share information on digital planetary data, including 
  availability, access and analysis methods.
* Present how-to guides for locating, acquiring, processing and 
  working with digital planetary data.

Planetary Software Developers Track
* Bring researchers and technology experts together to discuss and 
  exchange ideas to identify difficult planetary research issues that 
  can be addressed by software development.
* Present planetary data processing and software development methods 
  and techniques.
* If you cannot attend, we would like to invite you to share your 
  thoughts on needed software technologies for the planetary community 
  (5-10min survey).

POSTDOCTORAL RESEARCHER: SECONDARY ION MASS SPECTROMETRY (SIMS) 
MICROPROBE ANALYSIS

The Lunar and Planetary Institute (LPI), part of the Universities 
Space Research Association, invites applications for a postdoctoral 
fellowship in the area of SIMS isotopic and elemental analysis of 
Martian meteorites.

The successful candidate will work with an international team at NASA 
Johnson Space Center in Houston.  Candidate should be self-motivated, 
and must have a Ph.D. in geochemistry, cosmochemistry, or related. 
Strong background in ion microprobe analysis essential.  Experience 
in analysis/interpretation of Pb isotopes is advantageous. 
Experience with a Cameca 1270/80 is also advantageous.  Knowledge 
of Martian geochemistry and petrology is beneficial, but not essential.
Travel is required.  Candidates should also present an independent
research plan that complements the Martian meteorite study. 

Position is for one year, with possible extension to a second year. 
Applicants should send a letter of interest, a curriculum vita with 
list of publications, a brief statement of research interests, and 
three references to resume@lpi.usra.edu. Further details contact: 
Justin Simon (justin.i.simon@nasa.gov) or

MARS EXPLORATION PROGRAM PROPOSALS

The Mars Exploration Program has issued a Request for Proposals 
for the Critical Data Products VII on April 2, 2012.  This RFP seeks 
proposals supporting the development of a number of scientifically 
high-priority landing sites on Mars that would be added to a list for 
future landed missions.  Details of the RFP are posted at:

ASTRONOMER JOB AT STSCI

The Space Telescope Science Institute (STScI) welcomes applications 
from outstanding astronomers for one or more openings in the coming 
year. We are seeking enthusiastic candidates with an exceptional 
research record in observational or theoretical astronomy, including 
those with a focus on instrumentation. Appointments can be made on 
either the tenure-track or the scientist-track, and at junior or 
senior levels. We particularly encourage applications from researchers
with a background in solar system science or optics, and/or researchers
with a strong technical background. Tenure-track astronomers spend 
50% of their time on personal research and 50% in support of the 
science operations mission of the Institute. Scientist-track 
astronomers spend up to 80% of their time in support of science 
operations and 20% on independent research. Scientist track 
astronomers have the option of buying back up to an additional 30% 
of their time for independent research using external funding.

Candidates must have a Ph.D. or equivalent degree in astronomy,
physics, or planetary science, and have postdoctoral and/or other 
experience demonstrating a distinguished record of independent 
research or technical innovation. Applications received by 
May 15, 2012 will receive primary consideration.
