GSA ANNUAL MEETING TOPICAL SESSION - THE HEART OF AN EXPLORER: A
TRIBUTE TO RONALD GREELEY

Ronald Greeley, who helped found the GSA Planetary Geology Division
30 years ago, passed away unexpectedly in late October 2011. Ron was
a leader and helped build the field of planetary geology, with work
that spanned the breadth of planetary research. From volcanic to
aeolian studies, from laboratory experiments to study of terrestrial
field analogs, and from mathematical modeling to geologic mapping to
NASA planetary mission data analysis, there is virtually no area or
technique in planetary geology in which Ron did not participate. In
tribute to Ron's memory, and all he did on behalf of our field, we
invite oral and/or poster presentations from Ron's colleagues and
former students for this wide-ranging planetary geology session to
discuss recent results from your work in the studies, or techniques,
or on missions, that Ron Greeley participated.

The GSA Abstract deadline is Tuesday, August 14, 2012.  The 2012 GSA
Annual Meeting is 4-7 November in Charlotte, North Carolina.  To
submit abstracts, go to this website:

MAVEN SCIENCE COMMUNITY WORKSHOP, 2 DECEMBER 2012, SAN FRANCISCO

The MAVEN science team is planning a one-day workshop for the Mars
science community to discuss the MAVEN mission. We will provide
details on the mission plan, spacecraft, instruments, observations and
sequencing, and anticipated data products and science return. We want
to make detailed information available so that those scientists with an
interest in using the data or applying it to models can begin preparing
for data return and release, and so that those with an interest in
proposing for the planned Participating Scientist program can learn
details of what we are planning.

The workshop will be held on the Sunday immediately before the Fall AGU
meeting (note that the dates for the AGU meeting have been changed to
December 3-7, 2012). It will be held in downtown San Francisco, at a
venue to be announced.

For details, go to the MAVEN web site:

RELEASE OF FOUR STARDUST INTERSTELLAR FOIL CRATER SAMPLES FOR
GENERAL ALLOCATION

The Stardust Interstellar Sample Preliminary Examination (ISPE) Group
has released one FIBed section from each of four craters from the
Stardust Interstellar tray's aluminum foils. The samples are being
released before the end of the ISPE because of the potential that the
samples could be scientifically critical to the successful conclusion
of the group's efforts. We do not know what made these craters, and we
stress that we are not definitely sure they are interstellar in origin.
They could be interplanetary dust particles, or even secondaries from
impacts onto other spacecraft hardware. We are releasing these samples
now so that we can learn about their origin.
 
If you would like to request one of more of these samples for analysis
please prepare a Stardust sample request and send it to the Stardust
Curator. The deadline for these requests is May 1, 2012.
 
Please go to the Curator's website for more complete details:
