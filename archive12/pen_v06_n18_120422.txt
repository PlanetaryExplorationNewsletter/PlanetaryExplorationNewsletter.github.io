SHORT COURSE AND FIELD SCHOOL AT THE SUDBURY IMPACT STRUCTURE

The Canadian Lunar Research Network, hosted at the Centre for 
Planetary Science an Exploration at Western University, Canada, 
together with the NASA Lunar Science Institute and the LPI-JSC Center 
for Lunar Science and Exploration, are proud to announce the "Short 
Course and Field School at the Sudbury Impact Structure". This is a is 
a week-long classroom and field training program based in Sudbury, 
Ontario. The goal of the program will be to introduce students to 
impact cratering processes and observe, in the field, the attributes of 
an immense basin-size impact structure. Sudbury is known for 
spectacular shatter cones, tremendously thick melt-bearing impact 
breccias (the Onaping Formation), and a differentiated impact melt 
sheet (the Sudbury Igneous Complex). Skills developed during the 
program should better prepare students for their own thesis studies in 
impact cratered terrains, whether they be on Earth, the Moon, Mars.

Partial funding will be available to successful U.S. applicants.

LAST CALL FOR ABSTRACTS - CONFERENCE ON COMPARATIVE CLIMATOLOGY OF 
TERRESTRIAL PLANETS

Hotel Boulderado, Boulder, CO (USA)

June 25-29, 2012

http://www.lpi.usra.edu/meetings/climatology2012/

This conference brings together international specialists from a broad 
range of disciplines to present the latest ideas on the comparative 
aspects of climates on Earth, Venus, Mars, Titan and extra-solar 
planets. The four-day conference will be organized by sessions of oral 
and poster presentations that emphasize current thoughts on climate 
processes in Earth's atmosphere; terrestrial planet climate models; 
interactions between planetary interiors, surfaces and atmospheres; 
solar-atmosphere interactions; and exoplanet atmospheres. A key aspect 
of this conference is the inclusion of several open discussions 
throughout the meeting, led by panels of distinguished scientists in 
climate research. The meeting will provide a unique opportunity for 
scientists to advance understanding in climate research by stimulating 
cross-discipline collaboration.

Abstract submissions are due by Tuesday, April 24, 2012.

POSTDOCTORAL RESEARCH: SECONDARY ION MASS SPECTROMETRY (SIMS) 
MICROPROBE ANALYSIS

The Lunar and Planetary Institute (LPI), part of the Universities 
Space Research Association, invites applications for a postdoctoral 
fellowship in the area of SIMS isotopic and elemental analysis of 
Martian meteorites.

The successful candidate will work with an international team at NASA 
Johnson Space Center in Houston. Candidate should be self-motivated, 
and must have a Ph.D. in geochemistry, cosmochemistry, or related.  
Strong background in ion microprobe analysis essential. Experience in 
analysis/interpretation of Pb isotopes is advantageous. Experience with 
a Cameca 1270/80 is also advantageous. Knowledge of Martian 
geochemistry and petrology is beneficial, but not essential. Travel is 
required. Candidates should also present an independent research plan 
that complements the Martian meteorite study. 

Position is for one year, with possible extension to a second year.  
Applicants should send a letter of interest, a curriculum vita with 
list of publications, a brief statement of research interests, and 
three references to resume@lpi.usra.edu. Further details contact 
Justin Simon (justin.i.simon@nasa.gov) or John Jones 
(john.h.jones@nasa.gov). Information on research and facilities at 
the LPI can be found at:

Employer.

NASA POSTDOCTORAL FELLOWSHIPS

The NASA Postdoctoral Program (NPP) offers scientists and engineers 
unique opportunities to conduct research at NASA Centers. Each NPP 
fellowship opportunity is designed to advance NASA research in a 
specific project related to space science, earth science, aeronautics, 
exploration systems, lunar science, astrobiology, or astrophysics.

Applicants must have a Ph.D. or equivalent degree in hand before 
beginning the fellowship, but may apply while completing the degree 
requirements. U. S. citizens, Lawful Permanent Residents, and foreign 
nationals eligible for J-1 status as a Research Scholar may apply.

Stipends start at $50,000 per year, with supplements for high 
cost-of-living areas and for certain academic specialties. Financial 
assistance is available for relocation and health insurance, and 
$8,000 per year is provided for professional travel.

Applications are accepted three times each year: March 1, July 1, and 
November 1.
