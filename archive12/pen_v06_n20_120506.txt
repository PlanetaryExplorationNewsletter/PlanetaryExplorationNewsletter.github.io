POSTDOCTORAL RESEARCHER: SECONDARY ION MASS SPECTROMETRY (SIMS) 
MICROPROBE ANALYSIS

The Lunar and Planetary Institute (LPI), part of the Universities 
Space Research Association, invites applications for a postdoctoral 
fellowship in the area of SIMS isotopic and elemental analysis of 
Martian meteorites.

The successful candidate will work with an international team at NASA 
Johnson Space Center in Houston. Candidate should be self-motivated,
and must have a Ph.D. in geochemistry, cosmochemistry, or related. 
Strong background in ion microprobe analysis essential. Experience 
in analysis/interpretation of Pb isotopes is advantageous. Experience 
with a Cameca 1270/80 is also advantageous. Knowledge of Martian 
geochemistry and petrology is beneficial, but not essential. Travel 
is required. Candidates should also present an independent research 
plan that complements the Martian meteorite study. 

Position is for one year, with possible extension to a second year.  
Applicants should send a letter of interest, a curriculum vita with
list of publications, a brief statement of research interests, and 
three references to resume@lpi.usra.edu. 

Further details, contact: 
Justin Simon (justin.i.simon@nasa.gov) or 
John Jones (john.h.jones@nasa.gov)

[NASA] COORDINATION WITH ESA'S 2012 CALL FOR A SMALL MISSION OF 
OPPORTUNITY IN ESA'S SCIENCE PROGRAM FOR A LAUNCH IN 2017

- Request due to NASA by May 15
- NASA response to PI by June 1
- Proposal due to ESA by June 15
- Submission of full proposal and cover letter to NASA by June 22

NASA is prepared to provide proposing U.S. investigators with a letter 
of acknowledgement for proposals in alignment with established NASA 
strategic science objectives. Proposers desiring such a letter must 
submit to NASA a brief description of (1) the mission concept 
contemplated, (2) the relevance of its science objectives to 
established NASA science objectives, and (3) contemplated U.S. 
involvement in the mission to be proposed. This description may 
not exceed 1000 words (~two single-spaced pages, 12-point type) and 
must be submitted by email no later than May 15, 2012, to 
colleen.hartman@nasa.gov. Requests for letters of acknowledgement 
should come from the lead U.S. collaborator on the proposed mission. 
NASA will conduct an internal review of the proposed mission's 
relevancy to NASA science objectives and, for those submissions in 
good alignment with these objectives, will provide a letter of 
acknowledgement in time for submission to ESA with the proposal.

MARS EXPLORATION SCIENCE MONTHLY NEWSLETTER - MAY 2012

Dear Members of the Mars Community,
 
On behalf of Dave Des Marais, the MEPAG Chair, Dave Beaty, Rich Zurek, 
and Charles Budney of the Mars Program Science Office, the May 2012 
edition of the Mars Exploration Science Monthly Newsletter can be 
found on the web at:

CALL FOR IMAGING REQUESTS FOR CANDIDATE LANDING SITES FOR FUTURE MARS 
MISSIONS

The Mars Exploration Program Offices at NASA Headquarters and the 
JPL invite submission of observation requests for new candidate landing
sites for possible future rover missions to conduct in-situ science 
investigations and cache samples for possible return to Earth and 
subsequent analysis. 

Candidate sites are also to be provided to the Mars Odyssey and Mars 
Express teams to conduct additional imaging investigations.  Sites 
proposed to previous calls should not be re-proposed. 

Proposed observation requests of landing sites requires submission of 
a short abstract. A template is available at:

http://marsnext.jpl.nasa.gov/ 

Additional details can be found at:

http://mepag.jpl.nasa.gov/meeting/jun-11/index.html 

Requests for imaging of candidate landing sites can be submitted 
through July 15, 2012 via e-mail to John Grant (grantj@si.edu), 
Matt Golombek (mgolombek@jpl.nasa.gov), and Nicolas Mangold 
(Nicolas.Mangold@univ-nantes.fr)

It is anticipated that a landing site workshop will be held during 
early 2013 to enable discussion of new candidate sites.  It is likely 
that sites deemed of the highest merit will be selected for additional 
imaging. Please note that this data call is an unfunded effort.

NASA POSTDOCTORAL FELLOWSHIPS

The NASA Postdoctoral Program (NPP) offers scientists and engineers 
unique opportunities to conduct research at NASA Centers. Each NPP 
fellowship opportunity is designed to advance NASA research in a 
specific project related to space science, earth science, aeronautics, 
exploration systems, lunar science, astrobiology, or astrophysics.

Applicants must have a Ph.D. or equivalent degree in hand before 
beginning the fellowship, but may apply while completing the degree 
requirements. U. S. citizens, Lawful Permanent Residents, and foreign
nationals eligible for J-1 status as a Research Scholar may apply.

Stipends start at $50,000 per year, with supplements for high cost-
of-living areas and for certain academic specialties. Financial 
assistance is available for relocation and health insurance, and 
$8,000 per year is provided for professional travel.

Applications are accepted three times each year: March 1, July 1, 
and November 1.

Workshop will be held on Monday, July 16, 2012 at the NASA Ames
Research Center (ARC), preceding the NASA Lunar Science Forum. This 
one-day workshop for graduate students, postdocs, and early career 
professionals will focus on effective career strategies for navigating 
today's job market.  The purpose of this group is to engage and 
develop the next generation of lunar scientists and engineers, and to 
enable their successful involvement in current planning for the 
exploration of the Moon.
