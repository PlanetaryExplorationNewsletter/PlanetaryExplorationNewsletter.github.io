THE CROSS-AG IDEA WORKING GROUP - LOOKING FOR A NEW CO-CHAIR

The Cross-AG IDEA Working Group is an organization of planetary 
scientists committed to working on matters of inclusion, diversity, 
equity and accessibility in our community. The Working Group's role is 
to provide feedback and suggestions for accountability for the 
Planetary Science Advisory Group and to listen to the needs of the 
NASA assessment/analysis groups. We are looking for someone to serve 
as co-chair for a 2-year term. 

See the website to learn more about the group, the duties of the 
co-chair, and how to notify us of your interest in the co-chair 
position:

WORKSHOP ON EDIA FOR LEADERS IN PLANETARY SCIENCE

October 23-25, 2023

We invite planetary scientists in leadership roles to join us for the 
second offering of our workshop on engaging with EDIA concepts and 
strategies. "Leaders" includes: mission and instrument PIs (and 
future PIs), department chairs, institute directors, program officers, 
and group leaders of all kinds. This workshop (~25 people or less, to 
encourage interaction) provides an introduction to EDIA concepts and 
the basic tools needed to enact positive change in personal and 
professional spheres. Entirely online, no registration fee.

"Well organized and well-facilitated, great breadth and depth of 
topics, and good novel interactive components as well. The content was 
expertly curated and extremely well presented..." 
-Participant, December 2022
 
Facilitators: Drs. Julie Rathbun and JA Grier.

This in-person workshop focuses on key aspects of the peer review 
process at the AAS journals. Through extensive training with hands-on 
labs, participants gain familiarity with the AAS peer review process 
and learn how to better use peer review for their own manuscripts. Be 
ready to interact with your fellow participants and Scientific 
Editors. This is not a passive, online, slide-oriented workshop!

APPLY FOR THE CULTURALLY INCLUSIVE PLANETARY ENGAGEMENT 
WORKSHOP
 
Planetary scientists and astrobiologists are invited to apply to 
attend the Culturally Inclusive Planetary Engagement professional 
development workshop at the American Museum of Natural History in New 
York, NY September 21-23, 2023. During the two-day workshop, planetary 
scientists/astrobiologists and informal educators are paired together 
and supported in bi-directional conversations around diversity and 
inclusion in engaging Black and Latinx audiences in planetary science. 
On September 23 participants will lead hands-on activities during a 
co-designed public engagement event following the workshop held in 
collaboration with a local youth-serving organization. 
 
During the workshop, participants team-up to:
- Explore the importance of building equitable partnerships with 
  organizations, subject matter experts, and informal educators 
  serving Black and Latinx audiences
- Learn evidence-based culturally relevant authentic approaches to 
  nurture connections with Black and Latinx individuals
- Practice planetary science engagement approaches through a 
  culturally inclusive lens
 
The deadline to apply is September 1, 2023. Space is limited to 10 
informal educators and 10 scientists. Stipends are available for 
Participants able to accept them. More information, including a link 
to the application, is available online at:

THE NEW HORIZONS URANUS/NEPTUNE OBSERVATION CAMPAIGN AND A REQUEST 
FOR GROUND-BASED AMATEUR OBSERVING SUPPORT

NASA's New Horizons (NH) spacecraft plans to observe Uranus and 
Neptune from its location in the outer Solar System in September 2023, 
concurrently with the Hubble Space Telescope in Earth orbit. The NH 
science team requests and welcomes observations of both of these ice 
giant planets from the global amateur astronomy community during the 
week before, during and after these observations to enhance the 
science that NH and HST observations produce.

The timeframes of NH and HST observations for each object are:

Uranus (NH and HST offset observing times)
- NH: September 16, 12:15 UT - September 17 06:27 UT (17.2 hours)
- HST: September 17, 06:00 UT - September 18 21:00 UT

Neptune (NH and HST are basically concurrent)
- NH: September 22, 07:35 UT - September 23, 16:59 UT (32.4 hours)
- HST: September 22, 03:20 UT - September 23, 18:10 UT
