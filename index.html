15TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SUBSTORMS (ICS-15)

The 15th International Conference on Substorms (ICS-15) will be held 
this year, from October 16-20, in Deqing (the scenic suburb of 
Hangzhou), China. The conference aims to bring together scientists 
from the magnetospheric, ionospheric, and planetary communities to 
review the recent discoveries in light of recent space missions and 
numerical simulations, and to discuss the current status and future 
direction of substorm research.

The meeting will be a hybrid meeting with online components. But we 
strongly encourage in-person participation, since the conference 
series are known for the atmosphere of lively discussions. We will 
start each day with a tutorial lecture on a specific topic, and we 
will provide sufficient time for questions and dialogues in each 
session.

Further information about the conference is given on the meeting 
website:

The deadline for abstract submission (July 31, 2023) is now 
approaching. Please kindly consider submitting your study of substorms 
to the conference, and we look forward to meeting you in China.

AGU SESSION P039: SPACE ENVIRONMENTS OF UNMAGNETIZED OR WEAKLY 
MAGNETIZED SOLAR SYSTEM BODIES AND THE EFFECTS OF SPACE WEATHER ON 
THESE SYSTEMS

The ionospheres and magnetospheres of weakly magnetized bodies with 
substantial atmospheres (e.g. Mars, Venus, Titan, Pluto and comets) 
are subject to disturbances due to solar activities, interplanetary 
conditions, or parent magnetospheric environments (e.g. solar flares, 
coronal mass ejections and solar energetic particles), sharing 
similarities with their magnetized counterparts but with 
scientifically important differences. As an integral part of planetary 
atmospheres, ionospheres are tightly coupled with the neutral 
atmosphere, exosphere and surrounding plasma environment, possessing 
rich compositional, density, and temperature structures. The 
interaction among neutral and charged components affects atmospheric 
loss, neutral winds, photochemistry, and energy balance within 
ionospheres. This session invites abstracts concerning remote and 
in-situ data analysis, modeling studies, comparative studies, 
instrumentation and mission concepts for weakly magnetized Solar 
System bodies. Topics such as dayside and nightside ionospheric 
characteristics and variability, ion-neutral coupling, and responses 
of the ionized and neutral regimes to transient space weather events 
are especially encouraged.

AGU SESSION P004: ATMOSPHERES, CLIMATE, AND POTENTIAL HABITABILITY OF 
ROCKY EXOPLANETS 

Exoplanet discoveries of the past decade have shown that every star 
hosts at least 0.1-1 roughly Earth-sized, or rocky, planets. Our 
galaxy therefore contains billions of rocky worlds, vastly 
outnumbering the four rocky planets of our own Solar System. What are 
these worlds like? This session invites submissions that probe the 
nature of rocky exoplanets, including: What can our Solar System teach 
us about rocky exoplanets? How different are atmospheres and climates 
on rocky planets around other stars, on rocky planets in exotic 
orbital states, or on rocky planets with radically different formation 
histories? How can we characterize such planets via observations? And 
could the processes that kept Earth habitable over billions of years 
also occur elsewhere? Submissions that use observation, experiment, or 
theory are all welcome.

MULTIPLE POSTDOCTORAL POSITIONS IN LUNAR SCIENCE AT BROWN UNIVERSITY

Description: The LunaSCOPE NASA SSERVI Team hosted at Brown University 
invites applications for multiple Postdoctoral Research Scholars that 
complement and enhance existing research into the Moon on topics of 
(1) magma oceans, (2) magnetism, (3) volcanism and tectonism, (4) 
volatiles, (5) regolith and impacts, and (6) Earth-Moon orbital, 
stress, and tidal evolution. Diversity, equity and inclusion are 
integral to LunaSCOPE and Brown University, and thus LunaSCOPE seeks 
qualified candidates who can contribute to equity, diversity and 
inclusion through service, mentorship, teaching and scholarship.

Interested individuals should have a Ph.D. in Planetary Science, 
Mathematics, or a related field. Start dates negotiable. LunaSCOPE is 
interested in diversifying planetary science and encourages 
applications from diverse candidates. Candidates from historically 
underrepresented group(s) in higher education are encouraged to apply.

Applications will be initially reviewed on August 1, 2023 and on a 
rolling basis thereafter. Apply at lunascope.org/jobs

If interested, please send a CV and brief statement of research 
interests and future research goals that highlights any previous 
experience with mantle, atmospheric, or exoplanet modeling and 
analyses to exoplanets [at] brown [dot] edu.

Questions can be directed to Alex Evans (alex_evans [at] brown [dot] 
edu).

[NASA] SMD: ROSES-23 AMENDMENT 33: SUPPLEMENTS FOR OPEN-SOURCE SCIENCE 
FINAL TEXT

F.8 Supplements for Open-Source Science (SOSS) solicits proposals to 
add an open science component to an existing "parent" ROSES award. The 
goal of this program element is to increase the accessibility, 
inclusivity, and reproducibility of the science from the parent award, 
and/or to contribute back to the open-science communities relevant to 
the parent award.

https://tinyurl.com/yc3ry59j

Final text and due dates are released. No Notices of Intent are 
requested for this program element and proposals may be submitted at 
any time until the close date of ROSES-2023 on March 29, 2024.

https://solicitation.nasaprs.com/ROSES2023

Questions concerning F.8 SOSS may be directed to Steven Crawford at 
steven.m.crawford@nasa.gov and Paige Martin at paige.e.martin@nasa.gov.

[NASA] SMD: ROSES-23 AMENDMENT 34: COLLISION AVOIDANCE / CONJUNCTION 
ASSESSMENT REQUIREMENTS ADDED TO THE ROSES SUMMARY OF SOLICITATION

Research Opportunities in Space and Earth Sciences (ROSES) - 2023, 
solicits basic and applied research in support of NASA's Science 
Mission Directorate. The ROSES Summary of Solicitation lays out rules 
that, by default, apply to all program elements in ROSES unless 
superseded by a Division Overview or an individual program element.

This amendment adds to Section VIII(b) of the ROSES Summary of 
Solicitation (SoS) subsection ii "Collision Avoidance / Conjunction 
Assessment Requirements" that describes a new requirement that applies 
to a specific subset of proposals. See Section VIII(b)ii of the 
ROSES-23 SoS for more information. As appropriate, reference to this 
subsection of the SoS and to NPR 8079.1 from which this requirement 
derives, will be added to program elements. Also, a statement about 
accessibility costs being allowable has been added to Section II(a). 
New text is in bold.

https://nodis3.gsfc.nasa.gov/displayDir.cfm?t=NPR&c=8079&s=1

Questions concerning Collision Avoidance / Conjunction Assessment 
Requirements may be directed to Lauri Newman at 
lauri.k.newman@nasa.gov. Other questions about the ROSES-2023 
Solicitation may be directed to Max Bernstein at sara@nasa.gov.
