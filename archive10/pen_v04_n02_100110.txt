SETI INSTITUTE SEMINAR SERIES

The SETI Seminar Series is a weekly scientific colloquium held in 
Mountain View California. We have speakers from around the Bay Area and 
beyond talk about their latest science results. We have archived more 
than 70 talks on you tube here: http://youtube.com/setiinstitute
Our web page is here: http://seti.org/csc/lectures
You can subscribe to our twice-weekly email list for future talks:

NSRC PRE-REGISTRATION DEADLINE: 15 JANUARY

Pre-Register for NSRC Before Jan 15 to Guarantee Your Seat: The early 
registration deadline for the Next-Gen Suborbital Researchers 
Conference (Boulder, Colorado; 18-20 February) is right around the 
corner next week-on January 15th. 

We are encouraging those interested in attending to register early 
because attendance will be limited by the meeting facility size; early 
registration is also less expensive than full registration.

For more information on the meeting program, list of speakers, linked 
speaker abstracts, and how to register, go to: 

http://www.lpi.usra.edu/meetings/nsrc2010/

About NSRC: The Next-Gen Suborbital Researchers Conference (NSRC) will 
bring together researchers from government, industry, and academia, 
NASA and FAA officials, and firms building next-gen suborbital 
vehicles. NSRC will provide a forum to learn about the experiment and 
EPO capabilities of these new suborbital systems and their 
revolutionary capabilities. NSRC will also provide an opportunity for 
attendees to make inputs on vehicle design requirements for science and 
education.

Astrobiology is the quest for understanding and characterizing life in 
the Universe, past and present, including its origin(s) and 
distribution. Water, a requirement for the emergence and development of 
life as it is currently understood, is abundant in the Solar System 
(and likely beyond) in the form of ice. This session focuses on 
physical, chemical, and spectroscopic properties of ices and related 
materials in the context of life. Particular topics of interest include 
the role of ices in origin, evolution and sustenance of life on Earth, 
Mars, and elsewhere; preservation and creation of biosignatures and 
sources of chemical energy; and effects from radiation. Contributions 
in the broader context of astrobiology are also welcome.

Our understanding of planet formation processes, particularly those of 
our own solar system through the study of the solar system small bodies 
such as asteroids, comets, and meteors, has progressed a great deal in 
recent years due to important advances in many areas that involve 
theoretical, observational, and experimental fields of astronomy and 
planetary science. These progresses have contributed to our new view of 
the origin and evolution of our solar system as well as extrasolar 
planetary systems that have been discovered with incredibly large 
variety. In this session, we will review a part of the latest results 
in these fields through theoretical, experimental, and observational 
aspects in terms of dynamical, physical, and chemical points of view. 
Participants with various different interests are quite welcome to 
contribute to this session.

PLANETARY SCIENCE SLIDES AND ILLUSTRATIONS

Are you looking for some great slides or illustrations to use in your
classes this term? The Planetary Science Research Discoveries (PSRD) 
website has powerpoint slides for 24 of its latest articles covering
fundamental topics in planetary science. The slides are annotated with
captions and notes, and are linked to PSRD articles that provide the
full context, additional graphics, and references. Go to

http://www.psrd.hawaii.edu/Archive/Archive-PSRDpresents.html

In addition, many college instructors have recommended their students
begin with PSRD when researching topics for term papers or other
research projects. All 140+ articles are available in the archive at

http://www.psrd.hawaii.edu/Archive/

CALL FOR ABSTRACTS: PLANETARY GEOMORPHOLOGY (GM1.3) AT EUROPEAN 
GEOPHYSICAL UNION GENERAL ASSEMBLY

Planetary geomorphology is advancing at an unprecedented rate due to 
the ever growing stock of publicly available remote-sensing and in-situ 
planetary data. In this session we aim to bring together both 
terrestrial geomorphologists and planetary scientists to share their 
knowledge for the benefit of all.

Research themes for this session include:
- remote sensing studies of solid body planetary landforms and processes
- in-situ studies of planetary landforms and processes from landing 
craft data; especially new observations from the Mars Phoenix Lander
- terrestrial field and laboratory studies of landforms and processes 
with application to other planetary bodies.
- new techniques in remote sensing, GIS, and computing that can advance 
the study of planetary geomorphology.
- studies of planetary surfaces that have can tell us more about 
geomorphological processes on our own planet.

Presentations discussing landforms and processes on Mars, Titan, Venus, 
Mercury, the Moon, asteroids and other solid bodies will all be welcome.

Meeting dates: 2-7th May 2010
Location, Vienna, Austria
Deadline for abstract submission: 18th January 2010
Session conveners Matt Balme, Sanjeev Gupta, Colman Gallagher, Alistair 
Bargery
