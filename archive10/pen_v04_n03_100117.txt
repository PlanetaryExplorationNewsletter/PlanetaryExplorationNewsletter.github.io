Description:
A primary goal of this session is to find a consensus among experts 
in the formation and evolution of cosmic dust: where it comes from and 
where it goes. All kinds of cosmic dust such as intergalactic dust, 
interstellar dust, circumstellar dust, cometary dust, asteroidal dust, 
interplanetary dust, circumplanetary dust, stellar nebular condensates, 
presolar grains, micrometeorites, meteoroids, meteors, and regolith 
particles are the subject of discussion. The session will address 
interrelation between them and perceptions on the dust alteration 
through a variety of processing.  This includes different methods of 
its determination (in-situ and laboratory measurements, astronomical 
observations, laboratory and numerical analogue simulations, 
theoretical modeling, etc.). However, the session is open for any other 
aspects of dust research.

CALL FOR AOGS 2010 ABSTRACTS: SCIENCE AND EXPLORATION OF MARS AND VENUS 

Meeting is July 5-9, 2010 in Hyderabad, India

Session: PS05

confSessionList.asp

This session will address the latest results of the different ongoing 
missions in orbit around Mars and Venus as well as those on the surface 
of Mars. It will cover all fields of research from the ionosphere and 
the atmosphere to the surface and interior of both planets. With Mars 
Global Surveyor, Mars Express, Venus Express, Mars Odyssey, Mars
Reconnaissance Orbiter, MERs and Phoenix, we have been able to address 
these fields of research improving and modifying our understanding of 
Mars and Venus significantly. The session is primarily targeted at 
presentations of new measurements, but authors presenting papers on 
theory and modeling in support of the analysis of new results will be 
most welcome. The second objective of the session is to discuss 
upcoming future missions and the results obtained from new ground based
observations. Broad solicited talks and contributed presentations will 
be highlighted in the program. Comparative studies of common features 
and processes in the atmosphere/ionosphere as well as on the surface/
interior of Mars and Venus with those of Earth are also encouraged for 
presentation at the session.

[NASA] MARS EXPLORATION PROGRAM REQUESTS FOR PROPOSAL FOR THE CRITICAL 
DATA PRODUCTS PROGRAM

The Mars Exploration Program has issued, in January 2010, two Requests 
for Proposal (round V) for the Critical Data Products program.  These 
RFPs cover Critical Data Products for the 2013 MAVEN mission and for 
analysis of landing sites for future missions.  Details of the RFPs 
are posted at:

[NASA] SOLAR PROBE PLUS AO AMENDMENT 1:  REVISIONS TO TABLE 4 AND 
TABLE B3

NNH10ZDA002O
Release Date:  December 3, 2009
Proposals Due:  March 26, 2010

With this amendment, the NASA Announcement of Opportunity (AO) 
NNH10ZDA002O, "Solar Probe Plus Investigations" has been amended to 
revise Table 4, Schedule for Solar Probe Plus Mission, and Table B3, 
Total Mission Cost Funding Profile Template.

Table 4, Schedule for Solar Probe Plus Mission, has been revised to 
include a new planning date for the start of Phase B and a new 
planning date for the end of Phase F. As stated in Section 5.3.1 of 
the Solar Probe Plus Investigations AO, the schedule in Table 4 is a 
planning schedule (which may be revised during Phase A) and should be 
the basis for the schedules in the proposed investigations.

Table B3, Total Mission Cost Funding Profile Template, has been 
revised to correct the alignment of fiscal year columns with mission 
phases, to add a column for Phase F costs, and to remove the row for 
Bridge Phase costs. An EXCEL version of the Total Mission Cost 
Funding Profile Template is available in the Program Library (see AO 
Section 6.1.4).

Amendment No. 1 to the NASA Announcement of Opportunity "Solar 
Probe Plus Investigations" (NNH10ZDA002O) is posted on the NASA 
research opportunity homepage at

OUTER PLANETS ASSESSMENT GROUP (OPAG) MEETING

February 8-9, 2010
Washington, DC

The February 8-9, 2010 meeting of the Outer Planets Assessment Group 
(OPAG) will take place at the St. Regis Hotel in downtown Washington, 
DC.  This will be a full 2-day meeting.

The Preliminary Agenda and Logistical details, including registration 
information, can be found at the OPAG website:

http://www.lpi.usra.edu/opag/

A major focus of the meeting will be to provide provide community input 
to the Europa Jupiter System Mission (EJSM) Science Definition Team 
(SDT).  The EJSM SDT will have met 27-29 January, and requests 
community feedback.  The OPAG meeting may well be the last chance on 
this side of the Atlantic for face-to-face community input to the SDT, 
before their report is finalized later this year. 

Please note that housing at the St. Regis Hotel is in high demand, and 
the OPAG room block will close at 5:00 pm this Sunday (TODAY), 
January 17.  A negotiated rate is available for the evenings of 
February 7 through 9 (see Logistical details).
