[NASA SPECIAL] NEW R&A LEAD POSITION IN PSD CLOSES TOMORROW (MON.)

This is to remind everyone that one of the best NEW jobs in the 
Planetary Science Division (PSD) of NASA Headquarters will close on 
May 17, 2010 (TOMORROW!).  This full-time, permanent civil servant 
position in PSD is dedicated to the management of the Planetary 
Research and Analysis (R&A) program. If there is one thing I have 
learned in the last couple of years is that NASA Hq is not dull.  We 
have a tremendous staff of dedicated people pushing the forefront of 
planetary science. Make no mistake, PSD is where it all begins.
 
The USAJobs Vacancy number is HQ10B0073. The position opened on 
April 16, 2010, and closes on May 17, 2010. For instructions on how to

EPSC 2010 LUNAR SESSIONS:  CALL FOR ABSTRACTS

Abstracts are now being accepted for two lunar focused sessions at the 
2010 European Planetary Science Conference (EPSC) in Rome, September 
19-25 in Rome, Italy.  Abstracts are due May 26, 2010.
 
A Science session entitled "Lunar Science and Exploration: Current 
Status and Future Outlook" will focus on the latest lunar science 
research and discuss future lunar science and exploration topics. A 
goal is to foster a strong Pan-European lunar science community and 
have the session lead to more collaborations.
 
An Education/ Public Outreach session entitled "Lunar Outreach as a 
Tool for Public Engagement in Planetary Science" will bring together 
amateur astronomers, educators, researchers, and scientists to 
discuss the latest developments in outreach activities for promoting 
public engagement in planetary science.

SPECIAL ISSUE OF EARTH, PLANETS AND SPACE

This issue of EPS will be devoted to the session "Cosmic Dust: Its 
Formation and Evolution" (II) of the AOGS 2010 meeting held in 
Hyderabad, India. However, it is open to submission of any other 
papers related to the topic. Contributions can discuss any aspect of
cosmic dust. All kinds of cosmic dust such as intergalactic, 
interstellar, circumstellar, cometary, asteroidal, interplanetary, 
circum-planetary dust, stellar nebular condensates, presolar grains,
micrometeorites, meteoroids, meteors, and regolith particles are the
subject of discussion.

All submitted papers go through a peer review process. Papers must 
be submitted to the EPS editorial office.  Electronic submissions to 
eps@terrapub.co.jp are encouraged, but authors who meet any 
difficulties with electronic submissions could submit a hard copy by 
post. For details visit

http://www.terrapub.co.jp/journals/EPS

The cover letter should mention "Submitted to the Special Issue: 
Cosmic Dust (II)." The deadline for manuscript submissions is 
15 September 2010. This special issue will hopefully be published in 
June 2011.

For more information on this special issue, please contact the 
corresponding editor H. Kimura (hiroshi@kitty.kobe-u.ac.jp).  
Questions on manuscript preparation should be addressed to the EPS
editorial office.

[NASA] 4TH EUROPA JUPITER SYSTEM MISSION INSTRUMENT WORKSHOP

NASA and ESA are organizing the 4th Europa Jupiter System Mission 
(EJSM) Instrument Workshop on July 26-29, 2010 in the Pasadena, 
California area.
 
This workshop will cover programmatic and technical aspects of the EJSM 
mission, and specifically of the two spacecraft (JGO and JEO).  Topics 
will include: Jovian radiation models, the JEO system reliability 
model, radiation shielding modeling results, and the planned JEO and 
JGO architectures.  Two classes will be offered as part of the 
workshop: a tutorial on the Jovian environments, and Planetary 
Protection considerations for instrument development. This workshop 
will provide relevant information to potential instrument providers who 
intend to respond to the Announcement of Opportunity (AO) for EJSM 
instruments currently expected to be released in 2011.
 
Further information and registration for the workshop and for each 
class will be available starting in May 2010 at 

http://opfm.jpl.nasa.gov/
 
Participants interested in presenting items of interest to the general 
instrument community, such as relevant EEE parts resources, radiation 
testing capabilities, modeling services, etc., will have the 
opportunity to provide a two-page synopsis which will be published as 
part of the workshop, a poster for a group poster session, and a short 
presentation at the workshop.

[NASA] APPROVED PARTS AND MATERIALS LIST (APML) AVAILABLE FOR EJSM AO

To help potential proposers to the upcoming instrument Announcement of 
Opportunity, the Europa Jupiter System Mission (EJSM), Jupiter Europa 
Orbiter (JEO) pre-project has made the current Approved Parts and 
Materials List (APML) available to the community. The APML is the 
selection source for all Electrical, Electronic, and Electromechanical 
(EEE) parts and materials to be used on the JEO spacecraft subsystems 
and instruments. The pre-project will continue to add approved parts 
and materials to the APML.  The EEE part and material information in 
the APML is arranged as an Excel spreadsheet.  This spreadsheet may be 
downloaded without restrictions and the information therein may be 
shared freely. Each EEE part listed within the APML has additional 
application dependent restrictions. Viewing this information is 
restricted to US citizens, US Resident Aliens and individuals covered 
under an applicable export agreement.  It is recommended that you 
evaluate the information in the unrestricted portion of the APML first. 
If you require the full content of the APML you may request access to 
the restricted information.  Details on how to access the unrestricted 
APML spreadsheet, an Introduction to the APML and the process for 
downloading the full APML spreadsheet can be found at:
