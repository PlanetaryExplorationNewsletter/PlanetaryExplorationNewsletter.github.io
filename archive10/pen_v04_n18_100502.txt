2010 ANNUAL MEETING OF THE LUNAR EXPLORATION ANALYSIS GROUP 

The 2010 Annual Meeting of the Lunar Exploration Analysis Group will  
be held September 14-16, 2010, at the Holiday Inn Capitol,  
550 C Street, SW, Washington DC. The focus of the meeting will be 
using the Moon as a target for solar system exploration, science, 
commerce, education, and technology development. The three-day 
meeting will promote community discussion and provide input to the 
questions to be addressed.  As in previous years the meeting sessions 
will be populated through a combination of invited and contributed 
talks, and will be a blend of science, exploration, resources, and 
commercial activities. 

Abstract Deadline: June 30, 2010
Early Registration: by August 20, 2010.

NATO ADVANCED STUDY INSTITUTE ON REMOTE SENSING

NATO Advanced Study Institute "Special Detection Technique 
(Polarimetry) and Remote Sensing" will take place in Kyiv (Ukraine)  
on 12-25 September 2010.

The goal of the meeting is to present the most recent advances in
polarimetric detection, characterization, and remote sensing, 
including military and environmental monitoring as well as 
terrestrial, atmospheric, and astrophysical, specifically planetary, 
characterization.

In accordance with NATO regulations, there will be a number of 
previously invited main lecturers. In addition to the main lectures, 
there will be shorter lectures and contributed talks as well as 
poster sessions in which the more senior researchers, postdocs, 
and actual graduate students describe their own research.

If you would like to be invited as a speaker or a student, please 
apply by May 15, 2010. The details of the NATO ASI and the 
application procedure can be found in:

VENUS ATMOSPHERE AND SURFACE INTERACTION WORKSHOP

Venus Atmosphere and Surface Interaction Workshop and 8th VEXAG 
Meeting, Madison, Wisconsin - 30 August - 2 September 2010

VEXAG is sponsoring a workshop on the Venus atmosphere, surface, and
interior interactions, which will be followed by the 8th VEXAG meeting
in Madison, Wisconsin. As new missions are conceived to explore
Venus, this workshop will focus on comparisons between Venus and Earth
and outstanding science questions about the Venusian atmosphere, and 
its interaction with the surface and interior.  Also, this workshop 
discuss recent results from the European Venus Express orbiter, and 
those anticipated from JapanÂ¹s Venus Climate Orbiter as well as set 
the stage for future observations.

Workshop format will include invited oral presentations and poster
presentations. Please provide an abstract title at the VEXAG web-site

http://www.lpi.usra.edu/vexag

by May 15; abstracts are due July 15.

Students interested in Venus atmosphere and its interaction with the
surface are encouraged to attend.  Travel and lodging support is
expected to be available for a limited number of qualified students.

VEXAG Meeting #8 will follow this workshop on Thursday, September 2nd.
