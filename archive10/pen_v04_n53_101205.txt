PASSING OF TOM AHRENS

Planetary science suffered a loss this past week with the passing of 
Tom Ahrens, 74, who was known for his work on planetary impacts and 
the behavior of geologic materials under extreme conditions. Cal Tech 
has released a press release about Tom at:

JOB OPENING - LUNAR SAMPLE CURATOR
 
This is a heads-up that a civil servant position will be opening at 
the NASA Johnson Space Center for the position of Lunar Sample Curator.  
The successful candidate will oversee the Apollo lunar sample 
collection and the lunar sample laboratory suite, and will be 
encouraged to perform independent research.  If you have any questions 
about the position feel free to contact Carlton Allen, Astromaterials 
Curator, by email at carlton.c.allen@nasa.gov or by phone 
at 281-483-5126.
 
JSC Human Resources will post the vacancy announcement on USAJOBS in 
early January, if all goes as planned.  The announcement will contain 
details on the position.  In the meantime, anyone interested may want 
to get familiar with USAJOBS:

http://www.usajobs.gov/

specifically with the resume builder feature.  For questions on the
USAJOBS application process, contact Candy Hunt, HR representative, at  
candace.s.hunt@nasa.gov

MARS EXPLORATION SCIENCE REQUEST FOR FEEDBACK

The MEPAG Supporting Research and Technology Science Assessment Group 
(SRT-SAG) is requesting your feedback for a report to be submitted to 
the Planetary Science Subcommittee (PSS) of the NASA Advisory Council. 
The PSS is conducting a study into supporting research and technology 
programs to assess program relevance and effectiveness, and suggest 
possible improvements in program management.  We recognize that many 
of you may have already responded to a Planetary Science Division 
(PSD) survey on this topic, but we would like to hear your thoughts 
on the following topics from a Mars-specific perspective:

* Which current science-related research and technology programs are 
essential in meeting Mars Program objectives? 
* Are there research/technology programs or infrastructure that appear 
to be missing currently, but that are essential in meeting Mars Program 
objectives?
* Do you feel that non-Mars-specific R&A programs are maintaining a 
consistent attitude towards Mars-related research?
* Any other topics not addressed above.

Please send your responses to Vicky Hamilton 
(hamilton@boulder.swri.edu), by Friday, December 17, and be as 
detailed as possible.  There will also be an opportunity to provide 
feedback to members of the SAG during the AGU Town Hall meeting on 
Wednesday, December 15.

ASTRONOMERS EXPLAIN RECENT DISCOVERIES IN PODCASTS FROM THE 
ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY OF THE PACIFIC (ASP)

The nonprofit Astronomical Society of the Pacific is happy to announce 
the availability of the 25th full podcast in the Silicon Valley 
Astronomy Lecture Series, a talk by Dr. Gregory Laughlin (University 
of California, Santa Cruz) on the ultimate fate of the solar system.

You can find the audio podcasts, and instructions for getting to the 
video versions, at:

http://www.astrosociety.org/education/podcast/

This series of free public lectures is cosponsored by NASA's Ames 
Research Center, The SETI Institute, and the Foothill College 
Astronomy Program. 

A second, shorter series of podcasts called "Astronomy Behind the 
Headlines" features short interviews with astronomers designed to 
give you a quick look at the latest ideas in astronomy and space 
science and to provide links to resources and activities for educators 
at various levels. 

The most recent (9th) episode features Dr. David Grinspoon discussing 
cosmic chemistry.  Earlier podcasts covered black holes, the Kepler 
mission searching for other Earths, and gamma-ray bursts.

9TH IAA LOW COST PLANETARY MISSIONS CONFERENCE

June 21-24, 2011
Hosted at the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory, 
Laurel MD.

The 9th Low-Cost Planetary Missions Conference, organized and hosted 
by The Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory in Laurel, 
MD,  is an international forum for planetary scientists, technologists, 
engineers, managers, and agency officials to collect and exchange 
information and ideas for making this class of robotic mission 
scientifically valuable and yet affordably low cost.

The Low-Cost Planetary Missions conference is designed to increase and 
enhance the global community of practitioners. Areas covered in the 
conference program include, but are not limited to: missions and 
scientific results; mission planning and operations; mission 
management, technology and engineering, and delivery methods.

The Second Announcement and call for papers is posted:

[NASA] PDS RELEASES MORE MARS RECONNAISSANCE ORBITER DATA 

The Planetary Data System (PDS) is pleased to announce a new delivery 
of Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO) data for the following 
instruments:

CRISM, CTX, HiRISE, MARCI, MCS, RSS, SHARAD and SPICE

In general, MRO Release 15 includes data collected between February 9, 
2010 and  May 8, 2010.  The HiRISE release includes data acquired 
between August 1 and November 1, 2010 (MRO Orbits 18,800 - 19,999).  

This is the first release of CRISM TRDR products generated using 
Version 3 of the processing software.

Raw Gravity data for the time period covered by Release 15 was 
delivered as part of Release 14, so there will be no raw gravity 
delivery this time.

Applicants are invited for a postdoctoral position associated with the 
High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment (HiRISE) located at the 
Lunar and Planetary Laboratory at the University of Arizona.  The 
research emphasis will be on quantitative studies of Mars geology 
that are relevant to HiRISE and which may also utilize digital 
topography and other data.  Studies of other planetary surfaces, 
especially our Moon and Saturnian satellites, can also be accommodated.  
Researchers with primary experience and training in terrestrial 
geology and research that includes fieldwork on terrestrial analogs 
are welcome.  The Research Associate will be encouraged to propose for 
additional research funding as PI.
