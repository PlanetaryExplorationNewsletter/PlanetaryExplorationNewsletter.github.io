[NASA] WFIRST SCIENCE DEFINITION TEAM

Call for Letters of Application for Membership on the Science 
Definition Team for the Wide Field Infrared Survey Telescope (WFIRST)

WFIRST will be a wide-field near-infrared space telescope capable of 
performing imaging and spectroscopic sky surveys with multiple goals
including gravitational microlensing surveys for exoplanets, 
large-area sky survey and deep surveys for research in dark energy, 
and other extragalactic and Galactic research programs.

The members of the WFIRST SDT will provide NASA with scientific 
assistance during preliminary concept definition (Pre-Phase A)
activities.  Near-term activities of the SDT members will focus 
primarily on assessing the scientific approach to achieving the goals 
of the WFIRST space mission as outlined by the Astro2010 Decadal 
Survey.

The charter for the WFIRST SDT will be posted to:

http://wfirst.gsfc.nasa.gov/ 

in early November 2010.  A draft charter will be discussed at a
public teleconference of the Astrophysics Subcommittee of the NASA 
Advisory Council on October 29, 2010; contact Dr. Hashima Hasan 
for information. (hhasan@nasa.gov; 202-358-0692).  

Responses to this invitation should be received by the WFIRST
Program Scientist no later than November 23, 2010, at:

Dr. Rita Sambruna

PLANETARY PROTECTION POLICIES AND PRACTICES

NASA's Planetary Protection Office has developed a course on planetary 
protection policies and practices to familiarize current and future 
practitioners with NASA and COSPAR planetary protection programs. It 
provides a comprehensive review of all applicable policies, practices 
and procedures necessary to implement a successful planetary protection 
program, emphasizing integration of managerial, administrative, and 
laboratory activities. The course is supported by the NASA Planetary 
Protection Office and the NASA Astrobiology Institute.

This course is designed for managers, engineers, designers, lab 
technicians and others interested in learning about the theory behind 
and application of planetary protection principles. Participants learn 
how the work of personnel with diverse skills and responsibilities is 
coordinated to implement successful planetary protection programs. 
The course also provides hands-on training in microbial sampling and 
data management. It is taught by experts in the field with years of 
practical experience in all aspects of planetary protection.

Course: "Planetary Protection: Policies and Practices"

Location: Space Life Sciences Laboratory, KSC Kennedy 
     Space Center, FL 32899
Course Dates: December 7-9, 2010 
Registration Deadline: Nov. 19, 2010
Limited to 20 students 
For more information about this course, or to register for an upcoming 
course, contact:

MOUNT HOLYOKE COLLEGE POSTDOCTORAL FELLOWSHIP 

The Five College Astronomy Department (FCAD) at Smith, Amherst,
Hampshire, and Mount Holyoke Colleges and the University of
Massachusetts is offering a 3-year postdoctoral fellowship beginning 
in Fall 2011 to a recent Ph.D. recipient in astronomy or planetary 
science. The fellowship, which will be hosted by Mount Holyoke College, 
combines research and education in a unique and stimulating academic 
environment. For the research component, the Fellow will be expected 
to conduct a strong program that is synergistic with existing research 
programs in the FCAD and that also has a potential for undergraduate 
contributions. Applicants with experience in planetary science will be 
given special consideration. The educational component will consist of 
reinventing the sophomore-level planetary science course to reflect 
current practice (especially remote sensing and image analysis), 
and helping to teach the course each year.

Applications should include: (1) a curriculum vitae; (2) a statement 
of research goals and a proposal for a research project that would be
conducted in collaboration or close contact with an astronomer from 
the FCAD; and (3) a statement of educational goals, including an 
indication of what you would offer to the new course.  
Applicants should also be prepared to submit three letters of 
recommendation. 

Submit applications at:  

http://jobsearch.mtholyoke.edu 

Review of applications will begin December 15, 2010 and continue until 
the position is filled.
