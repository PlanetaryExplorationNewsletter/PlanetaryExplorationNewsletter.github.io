EDITORIAL: UNINFORMED CONGRESSIONAL ACTION AGAINST NASA UNCOSTED 
CARRYOVER AND NASA's RESPONSE ARE NOT GOOD FOR RESEARCH PROGRAMS

Mark V. Sykes
Planetary Science Institute

In report language for the 2010 Omnibus budget bill, Congress 
threatened NASA. Significantly reduce the amount of funds carried over 
from one fiscal year to the next or Congress would consider limiting 
NASA funding to one year with 10% to be allocated as two-year funding 
(effectively limiting agency carryover to 5%). NASA had carried over 
22% of its budget from fiscal year 2009 to 2010, of which 6% is 
associated with research programs. Congress did not investigate the 
level of carryover needed for the efficient management of NASA's
programs. In response, NASA is focusing on reducing carryover in 
research programs, primarily the less than 2% portion of the above 
that is carryover from more than one fiscal year. A significant 
portion of NASA research program carryover is by design to ensure 
efficient management. Congress needs to relieve the pressure it has 
placed on NASA research programs, and NASA's response to that 
pressure must not negatively impact those programs. Go to:

SUBORBITAL APPLICATIONS RESEARCHERS GROUP

The Suborbital Applications Researchers Group (SARG), a committee of 
the Commercial Spaceflight Federation, wishes to make planetary 
researchers aware of the coming capabilities of new generation 
suborbital vehicles and programs. Such vehicles have promising 
applications to both planetary microgravity research and planetary 
astronomy. More information can be obtained at:

http://suborbitalex.arc.nasa.gov/platforms 

and the associated web pages at this NASA web site.

JOB ANNOUNCEMENT: ASTROGEOLOGY INTERDISCIPLINARY POSTIION AT USGS

The U.S. Geological Survey's Astrogeology Science Center in 
Flagstaff, AZ invites applicants for one or more full-time permanent 
interdisciplinary positions that may be filled as a Physical 
Scientist, Geophysicist, Cartographer, Geodesist or Mathematician 
(GS-9/11/12, GS-13*).  This is a high-profile, high-impact opportunity 
to support NASA planetary missions and science studies by developing 
new planetary topographic mapping techniques and supporting planetary 
cartographic projects.

*GS-9: $47,448 - $61,678; GS-11: $57,408 - $74,628; 
GS-12: $68,809 - $89,450

[NASA] THE VENUS CLIMATE ORBITER PARTICIPATING SCIENTIST PROGRAM 
(VCO PSP)

The objectives of the VCO PSP are to enhance, aid in data
archival, and supplement Venus science to be performed by the Venus
Climate Orbiter (VCO, or AKATSUKI). The VCO PSP investigations aim to
understand the atmospheric circulation using global atmospheric
mapping by utilizing VCO's five cameras (from UV to IR wavelengths),
and by measuring the vertical structure of the atmosphere with radio
occultation techniques. VCO's systematic, and continuous observations
should provide a complete dataset of the Venusian atmospheric
dynamics that complements the Venus Express observations and prior
Venus missions. Up to two Participating Scientists in residence will
be selected to reside in Japan (ISAS) and work with the VCO Science
Team to reduce and archive data.
