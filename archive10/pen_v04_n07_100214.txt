SESSION 01d: The New Mars: Geochemistry of a Neighbor Planet

Mars is the one other planet in the solar system that apparently had 
a climate most similar to that of Earth. Mars differentiated very 
early into a core, mantle and crust; preserved an ancient geological 
record that has no parallel on Earth; and evolved mostly if not 
completely without plate tectonics. An early hydrological cycle 
sustained precipitation, streams and lakes. Later, volcanism, 
impacts, groundwater, and ice interacted at least locally. Liquid 
water participated in rock weathering reactions, such as iron and 
sulfur oxidation, that created distinctive weathering regimes and 
potentially sustained life. Methane in the atmosphere apparently 
requires a strong subsurface source(s). Conditions therefore could 
have supported life sometime in the past and perhaps could even 
sustain it today. This session will highlight recent geochemical 
investigations that are unveiling "the new Mars" and will lead 
ultimately to determining its geochemical evolution and whether 
life ever developed.

NASA LUNAR SCIENCE FORUM: FIRST ANNOUNCEMENT

The NASA Lunar Science Institute is pleased to announce the 3rd annual
NASA Lunar Science Forum, to be held July 20-22, 2010 at NASA Ames 
Research Center.  This year's forum will feature sessions on 
scientific results from the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter and Lunar 
Crater Observation and Sensing Satellite, as well as the presentation
of the annual Shoemaker medal and associated keynote lecture. As in 
past years, science sessions are structured to report on both recent 
results and future opportunities for lunar science, education and 
outreach.

Registration for the Forum is free - please register early.  Abstracts
will be accepted starting February 22 through May 3, 2010.  Please 
register for the conference and submit abstracts to the Lunar Science
Forum at:

http://lunarscience2010.arc.nasa.gov

We look forward to another exciting meeting focusing on science of, on
and from the Moon.

MEPAG #22 REMINDER

Dear Colleagues:

This is a reminder that the dates for MEPAG #22 will be here soon.  
This session is being held at the Double Tree Hotel in Monrovia, 
California, on March 17-18, 2010.  If you plan to attend, it is 
important that you RSVP to me at Joyce.N.Pulliam@jpl.nasa.gov as soon
as possible.  This helps me plan for space requirements, refreshments,
and handouts.

If you need hotel accommodations, the hotel has set up a web site so 
that you can go online and reserve a room in the MEPAG room block.  
Please note that the cutoff date for the room block is March 2.  The 
web address is:

20100313/index.jhtml?WT.mc_id=POG

For more information about the meeting, please refer to the 1st 
information circular that was sent out in January.  A copy can be 
found on the MEPAG web site at:

EJSM OPEN SCIENCE WORKSHOP

17 - 19 May 2010
 
ESTEC, Noordwijk, The Netherlands                                
More info: http://jakal.sp.ph.ic.ac.uk/EJSM

The Europa Jupiter System Mission (EJSM) is a joint NASA-ESA endeavor
currently in formulation devoted to exploring the emergence of 
habitable worlds around gas giant planets.

During this workshop it is planned to:

- Update the community on the EJSM status following on-going studies 
  in Europe and pre-project implementation activities in the US
- Review/(update where necessary) the EJSM science
- Review latest science results at Jupiter and gather any further 
  science topics that could be addressed by EJSM within the current 
  baseline model payload
- Discuss synergies offered by two spacecraft operating 
  simultaneously in the Jupiter System
- Review the status of instrument studies performed under ESA DOI 
  activities
- Discuss potential contribution to the exploration of the Jupiter 
  system by a JAXA Jupiter Magnetospheric Orbiter and a Russian Europa
  Lander, both under consideration
- Discuss the timetable for presenting EJSM to the Cosmic Vision down 
  selection process and ensuring community feedback to support EJSM 
  through mission selection.
 
Please register your interest in attendance and your intent to submit
an abstract.  The abstract deadline is 31 March 2010.
