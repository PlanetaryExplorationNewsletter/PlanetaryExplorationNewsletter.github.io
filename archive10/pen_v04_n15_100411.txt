LUNAR SCIENCE FORUM:  ABSTRACT DEADLINE APPROACHING

The NASA Lunar Science Institute is pleased to announce the 3rd annual 
NASA Lunar Science Forum, to be held July 20-22, 2010 at NASA Ames 
Research Center.  This year's forum will feature sessions on 
scientific results from the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter and Lunar 
Crater Observation and Sensing Satellite, as well as the presentation 
of the annual Shoemaker medal and associated keynote lecture. As in 
past years, science sessions are structured to report on both recent 
results and future opportunities for lunar science, education and
outreach.

Abstracts are due May 3, 2010.  Registration for the Forum is free; 
however, please register early.   Please  register and submit 
abstracts to the Lunar Science Forum at 

http://lunarscience2010.arc.nasa.gov

We look forward to another exciting meeting focusing on science of, 
on, and from the Moon.

NASA DISCOVERY PROGRAM COMMUNITY ANNOUNCEMENT (NNH10ZDA006J)

NASA’s Science Mission Directorate (SMD) intends to release an 
Announcement of Opportunity (AO) for Discovery Program missions no 
earlier than (NET) June 2010.  The Discovery Program conducts 
Principal Investigator (PI)-led space science investigations in SMD’s 
planetary programs under a not-to-exceed cost cap.  It is anticipated 
that approximately two to three Discovery investigations will be 
selected for 9-month Phase A concept studies through this AO.  At the 
conclusion of these concept studies, it is planned that one Discovery 
investigation will be selected to continue into Phase B and 
subsequent mission phases.  There will be no Missions of Opportunity 
(MO) solicited as part of this AO.  All MO are now solicited through 
the Stand Alone Missions of Opportunity Notice (SALMON) AO.

The AO will differ in several significant ways from the Draft 
Discovery Program AO (NNH10ZDA003J) released in December 2009.  The 
Draft Discovery AO is available by following the links at 

http://discovery.larc.nasa.gov/

Further information, as it becomes available, will be posted on the 
Discovery Program Acquisition Page at 

http://discovery.larc.nasa.gov/

[NASA] MEETING UPDATE FOR THE SMALL BODIES ASSESSMENT GROUP (SBAG)

To avoid a conflict with the Second Workshop on Binaries in the Solar 
System (July 13-15, See the PEN Meeting Calendar), we have shifted the 
3rd Meeting of the NASA Small Bodies Assessment Group to August 3-4, 
2010. The location remains Pasadena, CA.

Specific venues are in the process of being arranged and will be 
posted along with agendas at

http://www.lpi.usra.edu/sbag/meetings/

Presentations and Findings from the first two SBAG Meetings are also 
found at this site.

[NASA] DUE DATE DELAYED FOR ASTEP PROGRAM

Astrobiology Science and Technology for Exploring Planets (ASTEP) 
program solicits proposals for investigations focused on exploring the 
Earth's extreme environments in order to develop a sound technical and 
scientific basis to conduct astrobiological research on other solar 
system bodies.

This amendment delays the proposal due date for Appendix C.20, 
Astrobiology Science and Technology for Exploring Planets (ASTEP) 
Program.  Programmatic schedule conflicts at NASA Headquarters have 
postponed the ASTEP peer review and hence the date when SMD must have 
proposals.  The proposal due date for ASTEP has been changed to Friday, 
July 16, 2010.  Table 2 and Table 3 of the Summary of Solicitation for 
this NRA have been updated to reflect this change.

On or about April 9, 2010, this Amendment to the NASA Research 
Announcement "Research Opportunities in Space and Earth Sciences 
(ROSES) 2010" (NNH10ZDA001N) will be posted on the NASA research 
opportunity homepage at 

http://nspires.nasaprs.com/ 

(select "Solicitations" then "Open Solicitations" then 
"NNH10ZDA001N"). 

You can now track amendments, clarifications and corrections to ROSES 
and subscribe to an RSS feed at
