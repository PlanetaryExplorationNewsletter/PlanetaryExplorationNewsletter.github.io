DUSTY VISIONS 2010:  SECOND ANNOUNCEMENT

A workshop on Dust Spectroscopy and Dust Astronomy will be held from
July 14-16, 2010 in Goettingen, Germany

Abstract submission is now open (deadline 15 May 2010):

http://www.mpi-hd.mpg.de/dustgroup/dusty_visions_2010/submission.php

In a workshop style we want to discuss the present state and new 
venues in cosmic dust research. Fields that will be covered include: 

Circumplanetary Dust and Dusty Rings 
Cometary Dust
Interplanetary Meteoroids, Kuiper Belt Dust and Solar Dust
Lunar Dust
Interstellar Dust
Extrasolar Dust Rings
Dust Compositional Analysis
Laboratory Measurements

FOURTH MARS SCIENCE LABORATORY LANDING SITE COMMUNITY WORKSHOP:  
FIRST ANNOUNCEMENT

The fourth landing site workshop for the 2011 Mars Science Laboratory 
(MSL) workshop will be held in the vicinity of Pasadena, California, 
on September 27-29, 2010. This workshop is expected to focus on the
outstanding science questions and relative merits of the final MSL 
landing sites remaining under consideration and will begin the process 
of developing testable hypotheses that can be accomplished at each site 
using the MSL science payload. We anticipate a final, fifth landing 
site workshop will be held in the early spring of 2011 and focus mostly 
on compilation of a detailed set of testable hypotheses.

http://webgis.wr.usgs.gov/msl/

All members of the scientific community are encouraged to participate 
in this important activity. Input from the science community is 
critical to identification of optimal landing sites for the MSL. We 
look forward to your continued involvement in these activities!

Sincerely,
John Grant and Matt Golombek 
Co-Chairs, Mars Landing Site Steering Committee

INVITATION TO CONTRIBUTE TO A SPECIAL ISSUE OF PLANETARY AND SPACE 
SCIENCE DEVOTED TO "MERCURY AFTER THREE MESSENGER FLYBYS"

The Editors of Planetary and Space Science and the MESSENGER Science 
Team invite contributions to a special issue devoted to new findings 
on the planet Mercury.  The MESSENGER team will be contributing a set 
of papers reporting results from that spacecraft's three flybys of 
Mercury, particularly the third flyby in September 2009, as well as
models that account for those observations.  The special issue is 
also open to other papers reporting new results on Mercury science.  
These could be papers analyzing observations from the Mariner 10 or
MESSENGER flybys, reporting on new models, or presenting appropriate
ground-based or laboratory measurements.  The submission deadline for 
all papers in the special issue is 30 June 2010.
 
To assist in planning for the editorial review of papers for the 
special issue, contributors from outside the MESSENGER team are asked 
to send a brief electronic letter of intent by the end of May to the
Managing Guest Editor for the special issue, Sean Solomon 
(scs@dtm.ciw.edu), with a copy to the Editor-in-Chief of Planetary 
and Space Science, Rita Schulz (rschulz@rssd.esa.int).
