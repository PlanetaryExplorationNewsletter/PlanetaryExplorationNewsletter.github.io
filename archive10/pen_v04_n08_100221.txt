AOGS SESSION: SCIENCE AND EXPLORATION OF MARS AND VENUS (PS.05)

Annual Meeting of the AOGS (Asia-Oceania Geosciences Society)
Hyderabad, India, July 5-9, 2010

http://www.asiaoceania.org/aogs2010/index.asp

Deadline for Abstracts and Fee Waiver applications:  March 1, 2010

This session will address the latest results of the different ongoing 
missions in orbit around Mars and Venus as well as those on the surface 
of Mars. It will cover all fields of research from the ionosphere and 
the atmosphere to the surface and interior of both planets. With Mars 
Global Surveyor, Mars Express, Venus Express, Mars Odyssey, Mars 
Reconnaissance Orbiter, MERs and Phoenix, we have been able to address 
these fields of research improving and modifying our understanding of 
Mars and Venus significantly. The session is primarily targeted at 
presentations of new measurements, but authors presenting papers on 
theory and modeling in support of the analysis of new results will be 
most welcome. The second objective of the session is to discuss 
upcoming future missions and the results obtained from new ground based 
observations. Broad solicited talks and contributed presentations will 
be highlighted in the program.
