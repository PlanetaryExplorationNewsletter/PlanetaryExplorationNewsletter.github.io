CALL FOR ABSTRACTS, EGU 2011, SESSION: VOLCANISM, TECTONICS AND 
FAULTING IN THE SOLAR SYSTEM

Dear colleagues,

We would like to announce our session "Volcanism, Tectonics and 
Faulting in the Solar System" (PS10) at the next EGU in Vienna, 
3-8 April 2011. Session details are given at:

http://meetingorganizer.copernicus.org/EGU2011/session/6755

Our session aims to compile all facets of volcanism, tectonism, and 
associated interactions observed in our solar system. By providing a 
forum for a broad range of discussions, these observations and 
interpretations will be investigated and reviewed in the light of our 
current understanding of related processes on Earth.

The abstract deadline is 10 January 2010. Abstract submission can be 
done through EGU (see link above) or be sending it directly to one of 
the convenors.

We are looking forward to meeting you there.

The convenors,
Thomas Platz,
Matteo Massironi,
Graziella Caprarelli,
Paul Byrne,
Pascal Allemand,
Harald Hiesinger

MARS EXPLORATION SCIENCE REQUEST FOR FEEDBACK

MEPAG currently has two study teams in progress, both of which are at 
a stage where they are requesting feedback from the community. These
reports are summarized in ppt files posted at:

http://mepag.jpl.nasa.gov/meeting/index.html  

The first is by MSR E2E-iSAG (jointly sponsored by NASA and ESA) 
with preliminary findings related to the science of the MSR 
campaign.  Please send feedback be sent by Jan. 24, 2011 to either 
Chris Herd (herd@ualberta.ca) or Angelo Pio Rossi 
(an.rossi@jacobs-university.de).

The second is by the SRT-SAG and consists of a specific set of 
questions related to NASA's R&A program.  Please send responses by 
Dec. 20, 2010 to Vicky Hamilton (hamilton@boulder.swri.edu).
 
An oral discussion of both topics at a town hall meeting is planned for 
the AGU Conference in San Francisco on Wednesday, Dec. 15.  
All Mars scientists who are able to do so are encouraged to attend:
 
MEPAG Town Hall Meeting, Wednesday, Dec. 15, 12:30-1:30 PM, Moscone 
West, Room 3007.  (We regret that because of constraints associated 
with the conference, it will not be possible to webcast this town hall 
discussion).
