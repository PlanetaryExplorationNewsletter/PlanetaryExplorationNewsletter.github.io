EDITORIAL: COURAGE AND CONVICTION

Mark V. Sykes, Ph.D., J.D.
CEO and Director,
Planetary Science Institute

"Robert M. Nelson and 27 fellow Caltech scientists, engineers and 
administrators working at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory are risking 
their jobs and their personal financial well-being to fight for their 
right of privacy against unwarranted government intrusion. They are 
fighting for all of us, and they deserve our respect and support. On 
Tuesday, October 5, this battle moves to the United States Supreme 
Court.

... Nelson and all Caltech employees working at JPL were to be 
subjected to new background checks to determine their suitability for 
employment. Refusal to cooperate would mean termination. Unlike the 
usual criminal background and employment reference checks which Caltech 
employees undergo, a much broader net would be cast where landlords, 
neighbors, schools and any others could be asked open-ended questions
to provide any information ...

NASA's determination of whether these people are suitable for continued 
employment at JPL would include consideration of whether they have 
engaged in evils such as homosexuality, cohabitation, adultery, 
illegitimate children and mental, emotional, psychological, or 
psychiatric issues, among others."

51 WOMEN IN PLANETARY SCIENCE

The "51 Women in Planetary Science" project is halfway to its goal of 
featuring 51 women working on NASA missions, publishing in the 
journals, and serving their community on NASA and NRC panels. In the 
interviews published on a public web site, each scientist discusses 
her unique career path and interests and reflects on advice for 
students or postdoctoral fellows interested in a career in planetary 
science.  This project is part of the Women in Planetary Science 
e-mentoring initiative, created to bring woman scientist role models 
to students and early career scientists who may never have worked 
with a woman in the field, but who aspire to one day work for NASA 
or on missions to study the planets, the stars, and the incredible 
phenomena in our solar system.  The interviews are published on a 
web site open to all, and everyone - male or female - is welcome to 
participate in this respectful atmosphere that celebrates our 
passions, our differences, and our commitment to furthering the 
understanding of our solar system and other planetary systems.
