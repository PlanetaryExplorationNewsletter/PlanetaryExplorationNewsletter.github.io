[NASA] CHANGE IN NSPIRES TREATMENT OF NASA CS SALARIES

There is a change in how NASA Civil Servant (CS) salaries should be 
put into NSPIRES. This applies not only to proposals from NASA Centers, 
but also to all proposals that have NASA CS Co-Investigators, 
regardless of who is submitting the proposal.

Starting with C.24 Moon and Mars Analog Missions Activities and for all 
ROSES proposals due after mid August 2010, the NSPIRES web cover page 
budgets should no longer include the cost of NASA CS salaries. 
However, for the purpose of peer review, the proposal's detailed budget 
should continue show the total funding required, including CS salaries. 
In addition, the proposal's narrative must clearly indicate the NASA CS 
FTEs that are being applied to the proposed investigation. Please note 
that this does not apply to JPL scientist nor does it apply to civil 
servants from other government agencies, such as USGS.

A guide for proposers can be found at:

http://science.nasa.gov/researchers/sara/how-to-guide/nspires-CSlabor/

where it can also be downloaded as a PDF file.  This is one of a few 
NSPIRES guides that can be found in the Max's NSPIRES helpful hints 
section of the web site.

FALL AGU SESSION:  P03. EVOLUTION OF PLANETARY ATMOSPHERES

Understanding the evolution of planetary atmospheres is one of the most 
challenging topics in planetary sciences. The competing influences of 
planetary geology, geochemistry, climate, atmospheric chemistry, and 
biology (on the Earth) need to be weighed. While geochemical and 
geological data provide constraints for the Earth, data from planetary 
mission and astronomical observations are necessary for other planets. 
Extrasolar planets have heightened interest in planetary atmospheres, 
for it is by analysis of their atmospheres that we will assess the 
characteristics and habitability of these objects. This session 
welcomes both observational and theoretical studies relevant to 
evolution of planetary atmospheres in and out of our solar system.

FALL AGU SESSION P17: ICY OCEAN WORLDS

Strong evidence exists for liquid water oceans in several of the Solar 
System's icy worlds. These include the icy Galilean satellites Europa, 
Ganymede, and Callisto, as well as Saturn's moons Titan and Enceladus. 
Some medium-sized icy bodies, including Triton and the icy dwarf 
planets, may also contain (or have once contained) oceans. This session 
encourages presentations related to oceans within icy bodies, including 
their geological and geophysical signatures, composition, material 
exchange processes, and potential habitability.

FALL AGU SESSION ON PLANETARY SCIENCE FROM MULTIPLE-SPACECRAFT 
OBSERVATIONS
 
Science From Multi-Spacecraft Observations: The Moon, Mars, and 
Jupiter
 
Recently, the Japanese Kaguya (SELENE) three-satellite mission 
demonstrated a new multi-spacecraft capability to explore the Moon. 
Currently, there are several missions orbiting Mars that can perform 
coordinated and synergistic observations to enhance the global science 
return beyond that achievable independently by each spacecraft. The 
Europa Jupiter System Mission (EJSM) planned by NASA and ESA includes 
two spacecraft, one to orbit Europa and one to orbit Ganymede, and JAXA 
is studying a companion magnetospheric orbiter.  This session invites 
contributions that address the unique science opportunities for 
synergistic and complementary observations made possible by 
multi-spacecraft exploration of solar system objects.

OUTER PLANETS COLLOQUIUM SERIES

Would your institution like a colloquium presentation from an 
expert in outer solar system science, at no expense?  Would you 
like travel support to share your outer solar system research?  
Presenters and host institutions are sought for the Outer Planets 
Colloquium Series, a program that matches planetary scientists with 
university campuses and research institutions.  

Participation is open to two- and four-year undergraduate colleges, 
and to research institutions throughout the United States. Host 
institutions commit to making the necessary local arrangements. 
Presenters are encouraged to address the needs of graduate students, 
interns, and undergraduates and to give an additional presentation 
that is free to the public. Other interactions that increase 
awareness of outer solar system science may also be considered as part 
of the visit.

A range of topics is anticipated on the basis of speaker participation.  
A current list of presenters and their prospective talks is provided on 
the Series website.  Those interested in becoming speakers are 
encouraged to apply using the online application form.

The Colloquium Series will cover the presenter's travel expenses.  
There will be no honorarium for the speaker.

MEPAG MEETING ANNOUNCEMENT

You are invited to attend the next MEPAG meeting, which will be held 
Thursday-Friday, September 30-October 1, in Monrovia, CA.

http://mepag.jpl.nasa.gov/meeting/sep-10/
MEPAG_23_1st_circular-logistics.pdf

This MEPAG meeting will be held the two days immediately following the 
4th MSL Landing Site Workshop (September 27-29, 2010), and at the same 
location, and all members of the community are welcome to attend both.

We will adjourn the meeting by noon on Friday so that travelers can 
catch the afternoon flights home.  Although this meeting has no 
registration fee, we do request RSVPs to Joyce Pulliam so that we can 
plan the logistics properly.

[NASA] PDS RELEASES LCROSS DATA
 
PDS is pleased to announce the release of Lunar Crater Observation and 
Sensing Satellite (LCROSS) data from the following instruments:

Mid Infrared Cameras 1 and 2 (MIR1 and MIR2)
Near Infrared Cameras 1 and 2 (NIR1 and NIR2)
Near Infrared Spectrometers 1 and 2 (NSP1 and NSP2)  
Total Luminance Photometer (TLP)
Visible Camera (VIS)
Visible Spectrometer (VSP)
 
LCROSS was launched on June 18, 2009, and impacted the moon on 
October 9, 2009. Data were collected from shortly after launch, 
through the impact of the spent Centaur fuel container that served as 
the primary observation target, to the impact of the LCROSS spacecraft 
itself minutes later.
 
This release also contains data of the LCROSS impact from earth-based 
observatories:

The Agile instrument on the Apache Point Observatory 3.5m telescope
The CCD47 camera and CLIO imager and spectograph on the MMT 
     Observatory 6.5m telescope
The Portable High-speed Occultation Telescope Doc (PHOTDOC) and GJON 
     (PHOTGJON) cameras on the Magdalena Ridge Observatory 2.4m 
     telescope

Several more earth-based data sets will be released at a later date.
