THANKS TO OLD AND WELCOME TO NEW PEN EDITORS
 
After three years of diligent work, one of the founding Planetary 
Exploration Newsletter Editors, Nic Richmond, is departing PEN. I would 
like to thank Nic along with another founding editor, Matt Balme, who 
departed last summer, for their community service and aid in shaping 
the PEN into its present form.

Welcome to Susan Benecchi, and a belated welcome to Melissa Lane!

JOB ANNOUNCEMENT: RESEARCH POSITION AT MOUNT HOLYOKE COLLEGE

Darby Dyar's lab at Mount Holyoke College is looking for full-time or
part-time staff to work on planetary research. The position is 
available July 1, 2010, but starting date is negotiable. Position is 
grant-funded and requires a 1-3 year commitment. Responsibilities 
include assistance with supervision of spectroscopic instrumentation 
(FTIR, LIBS, x-ray and gamma-ray spectroscopy), data processing and 
analysis, sample preparation, and working with undergraduates. An 
ideal candidate will have a background in chemistry, geochemistry, 
planetary science and/or statistics. Strong organizational skills 
required. At least a B.S./B.A. or higher degree in the natural 
sciences required; post-docs will be considered. To apply, visit 

http://jobsearch.mtholyoke.edu 

and submit a resume, cover letter, and most recent transcript. 
Applications accepted until job is filled; review will begin May 31 
or earlier. 

Mount Holyoke College is an equal-opportunity employer. For more

FIELD TRAINING AND RESEARCH PROGRAM AT METEOR CRATER

The LPI-JSC Center for Lunar Science and Exploration is excited to
announce a new student field camp opportunity coming this fall! The
Field Training and Research Program at Meteor Crater is being 
organized under the auspices of the NASA Lunar Science Institute, 
which is designed, in part, to train a new generation of explorers for 
the Moon and beyond. The program is a week-long experience designed 
for graduate college students in geology and planetary science 
programs, although advanced undergraduate students will be considered 
if they have successfully completed a summer field geology program and 
have a demonstrated interest in impact cratering processes.

LLOYD V. BERKNER SPACE POLICY INTERNSHIPS

Application Deadline:  June 14, 2010

Successful candidates will be contacted no later than July 2, 2010.

The goal of the Lloyd V. Berkner Space Policy Internship program is to 
provide promising undergraduate and graduate students with the 
opportunity to work in the area of civil space research policy in the 
nation's capital, under the aegis of the National Academy of Sciences/
National Research Council's (NAS/NRC's) Space Studies Board (SSB).

Established in 1958, the SSB provides an independent, authoritative 
forum for information and advice on all aspects of space science and 
applications, and it serves as the focal point within the NAS/NRC for 
activities on space research.  It oversees advisory studies (including 
the on-going decadal surveys in astronomy and astrophysics, planetary 
science, life and microgravity sciences, and solar and space physics) 
and program assessments, facilitates international research 
coordination, and promotes communications on space science and science 
policy between the research community, the federal government, and the 
interested public.  The SSB also serves as the U.S. National Committee 
for the International Council for Science Committee on Space Research 
(COSPAR). Go to

EPSC, ROME 2010: OUTER PLANET SATELLITES SESSION

The abstract deadline for the European Planetary Science Congress, 
2010, to be held 19-24 September, 2010, in Rome, Italy, is now 
May 26th. We invite abstracts for the following session:

GP5: Satellites of the Outer Solar System

Convener: R. Jaumann. Co-Conveners:  H. Hussmann, L. Prockter, F. Sohl, 
O. Grasset, W. Patterson, L. Iess
 
This session is focused on studies of outer planet satellites 
including both single objects as well as satellite systems. We 
solicit presentations related to (1) surface geology and physical 
properties, (2) interior structure and evolution, (3) oceans and 
habitability of icy moons, (4) rotational and orbital states, (5) 
interaction of moons with other satellites and their central planets, 
and (6) dynamics and evolution of satellite systems. Special emphasis 
is given to the icy satellites of Saturn and their investigation by 
Cassini and to studies related to the Jupiter system, in particular 
Europa and Ganymede. We also encourage papers that investigate 
comparative studies among different icy satellites. The session is 
dedicated to theoretical investigations, laboratory studies, 
ground-based observations and analysis of data from space missions.
 
To submit an abstract, please go to:
