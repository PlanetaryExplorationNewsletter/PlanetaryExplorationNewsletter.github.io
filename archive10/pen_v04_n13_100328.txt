[NASA] SALMON AO AMENDMENT 5: PROCEDURE FOR SUBMISSION OF PROPOSALS BY 
NON-U.S. ORGANIZATIONS IN RESPONSE TO APPENDIX H6: EXOMARS TRACE GAS 
ORBITER INSTRUMENTS

With this amendment, the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration (NASA) Science Mission Directorate (SMD) Announcement
of Opportunity (AO) NNH08ZDA009O, "Stand Alone Missions of
Opportunity Notice (SALMON)," is amended to (a) establish procedures
for non-U.S. organizations to submit proposals through NSPIRES in
response to Appendix H6: ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter Instruments and
(b) correct Section 7.1.2 of the SALMON AO.

PI's considering taking advantage of this option must notify the
ESA contact prior to April 1 (e-mail to: jorge.vago@esa.int,
cc to albert.haldemann@esa.int).

SESSION ON "EXPLORING THE MARTIAN MOONS" AT THE EPSC CONFERENCE

Rome, 19-25 September 2010

http://meetingorganizer.copernicus.org/EPSC2010/session/3837

We invite for this session papers on the results of past or present 
planetary missions on the Martian Moons, and on Phobos in particular.
A special emphasis will be given to the February-March 2010 Mars 
Express flyby campaign. The following topics can be addressed: 
position and ephemerids, interior, mass determination, gravity field, 
subsurface, surface properties, temperatures, composition, geology, 
shape and volume, origin of the moons, solar wind interaction. Papers 
on the future mission Phobos-Grunt and on ideas for new missions 
(in-situ, sample return, manned missions) are welcome. Ground-based 
observations results are also relevant.

Deadline: 10 May 2010

EJSM OPEN SCIENCE WORKSHOP

17 - 19 May 2010
ESTEC, Noordwijk
The Netherlands

Abstract Deadline: April 15

The Europa Jupiter System Mission (EJSM) is an international mission
to the Jupiter system in development, with joint participation from 
ESA and NASA.
 
The ESA-NASA Europa Jupiter System Mission (EJSM) would consist of 
two primary flight elements operating in the Jovian system: the 
ESA-led Jupiter Ganymede Orbiter (JGO) and the NASA-led Jupiter 
Europa Orbiter (JEO). JGO and JEO would execute an extended 
choreographed exploration of the Jupiter System before settling into 
orbit around Ganymede and Europa, respectively. The overarching goal 
of EJSM is the study of the emergence of habitable worlds around gas 
giants. JGO and JEO would carry complementary instruments to achieve 
the following science objectives: characterize Ganymede and Europa as 
planetary objects and potential habitability; study Ganymede, Europa, 
Callisto and Io in the broader context of the system of Galilean 
satellites; and focus on Jupiter science including the planet, its 
atmosphere, and the magnetosphere as a coupled system.
