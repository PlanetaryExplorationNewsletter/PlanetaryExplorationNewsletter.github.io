[NASA] PARTICIPATION OPPORTUNITY FOR ESA EXOMARS

Interested scientists have an upcoming opportunity to participate in 
the Mars 2016 Entry-Descent-Landing (EDL) Demonstrator Module (EDM) 
science.

As part of the ExoMars 2016 mission, ESA is providing the EDL 
Demonstrator Module, a short-lived (~8 sol) lander.  Although designed 
to demonstrate EDL technologies, the EDM may have a very limited 
science capability.

NASA will consider supporting participation of U.S. investigators as 
individual Co-Investigators on EDL surface payload proposals that are 
submitted from ESA participating states.  All proposals must be 
submitted directly to the ESA Announcement of Opportunity and must be 
in collaboration with ESA participating state investigators.  NASA 
will not support hardware contributions.

Interested scientists should affiliate themselves as a scientific 
Co-I with a proposal from an ESA participating state.  In the event 
that this proposal is selected by ESA, NASA will invite a proposal 
from the U.S. investigator as a participating scientist. NASA expects 
to fund up to three individuals as participating scientists beginning 
in October 2011.

Further details or questions concerning this opportunity should be 
addressed to:

LUNAR EXPLORATION SUMMER INTERN PROGRAM

The Lunar and Planetary Institute (LPI) is hosting a special lunar 
exploration summer intern program to evaluate possible landing sites 
for robotic and human exploration missions. The LPI invites 
applications from graduate students in geology, planetary science, 
and related programs. The program is also open to undergraduate 
students in geology, astronomy, chemistry, and physics with at least 
50 semester hours of credit.  The goal of this program is to integrate 
NASA's lunar science priorities with the exploration components of the 
Constellation program. This will be a unique team activity that should 
foster extensive discussions among students and senior science team 
members.  The 10-week program runs from May 31, 2011, through August 5, 
2011. Selected interns will receive a $5000.00 stipend to cover the 
costs associated with being in Houston for the duration of the program. 
Additionally, U.S. citizens will receive up to $1000.00 in travel 
expense reimbursement, and foreign nationals will receive up to $1500 
in travel expense reimbursement.  Please pass this information on to 
any students who might be interested.  Application deadline is 
January 21, 2011.
