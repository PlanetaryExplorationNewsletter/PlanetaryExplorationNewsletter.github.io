[NASA SPECIAL] TWO PROGRAM SCIENTIST POSITIONS IN PLANETARY SCIENCE

As everyone knows we have had some retirements in the Research and 
Analysis and mission areas of the Planetary Science Division (PSD) of 
NASA Headquarters. I am delighted to say that we have posted TWO 
full-time, permanent civil servant scientist positions in PSD. Each of 
these positions serve as the Program Scientist responsible for 
overseeing the science content and execution of assigned Planetary 
Science mission(s) and R&A programs. We have a number of exciting 
planetary mission milestones ahead, especially in the next 18 months, 
so come help us lead in this new era of discovery.

The vitality of our Planetary Science program begins with the best 
people working at NASA Headquarters, so please take a moment to think 
about the future of the field and your role in making great things 
happen for the science community.  I encourage you to apply for this 
fabulous opportunity.
