EDITORIAL: CONGRESSIONAL LANGUAGE THREATENS TO UNDERMINE NASA RESEARCH
PROGRAMS

Mark V. Sykes
CEO and Director
Planetary Science Institute

White Paper available at:
http://planetarypolicy.org/NASA_Congressional_Language_100314.pdf

Summary:

In the Conference Report language to the recent 2010 Omnibus spending
bill which funded NASA this year, language directs NASA to effectively
reduce the amount of unspent (not just unobligated) money at the end of
the fiscal year. This may have the unintended consequence of damaging
NASA research programs and their management. Congress fails to
understand that research grants are not spent as soon as they are
awarded. NASA is working to avoid direct impact to universities and
research institutions, but may not be able to avoid some negative
consequences.  Jim Green, the NASA Planetary Science Division Director,
referred to this matter in his talk at LPSC on March 1.

Institutions receiving NASA research funds should communicate with 
their representatives and tell them that science research programs 
should be excluded from the application of this language. US scientists 
should encourage their institutions to do so.

42ND ANNUAL DPS CONFERENCE

The American Astronomical Society's Division for Planetary Sciences 
invites you to attend its 42nd annual meeting in Pasadena, California 
from October 4-8, 2010. Further information can be found at:

[NASA] PLANETARY SCIENCE SUMMER SCHOOL 

NASA is accepting applications from science and engineering post-docs, 
recent PhDs, and doctoral students for its 22nd Annual Planetary 
Science Summer School, which will hold two separate sessions this 
summer (19-23 July and 2-6 August) at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in 
Pasadena, Calif.  During the program, student teams will carry out the 
equivalent of an early mission concept study, prepare a proposal 
authorization review presentation, present it to a review board, and 
receive feedback.  At the end of the week, students will have a clearer 
understanding of the life cycle of a robotic space mission; 
relationships between mission design, cost, and schedule; and the 
tradeoffs necessary to stay within cost and schedule while preserving 
the quality of science.  Applications are due 1 May 2010.  Partial 
financial support is available for a limited number of individuals.

LPSC NASA NIGHT BRIEFINGS POSTED

MESSAGE FROM MEPAG

To Mars exploration community,
 
In preparation for the MEPAG meeting week (March 17-18; Monrovia, 
California), we are posting three documents on the MEPAG web site:

http://mepag.jpl.nasa.gov/
 
1. The 3rd Information Circular with meeting agenda and WebEx 
directions

2. A proposed revision to the text of MEPAG's Goal I. I encourage the 
astrobiology community to review this, and be prepared to discuss it 
at the meeting next week.  If you are not able to attend, it is open 
for written comment through March 31.

3. A proposed revision to the text of MEPAG's Goal IV (not quite ready 
yet, but will be posted soon). Those of you interested in the human 
exploration of Mars are encouraged to review this draft, and be 
prepared to discuss it at the meeting next week. Again, this draft is 
open for written comment through March 31.
 
I look forward to seeing as many of you as possible next week.
 
Jack Mustard
MEPAG chair

COSMIC MAGNETISM

June 7-11, 2010
Sebel Harbourside Hotel in Kiama, Australia
Registration deadline: April 30, 2010

http://www.atnf.csiro.au/research/Astro2010/

We are holding a conference entitled "Cosmic magnetism" between 
June 7 and 11th, 2010. The conference venue will be in Kiama, a 
seaside resort a short distance South of Sydney, Australia (accessible 
by train or car from Sydney airport).  In contrast to other 
conferences being held on cosmic magnetism, we intend to bring 
together experts on many different topics (from the Solar System, 
stars, pulsars, galaxies and the CMB), but then discuss topics 
relating to magnetic fields in a scale-independent manner.  

As the purpose of the conference is to discuss cosmic magnetism 
using a scale-free approach we are planning conference sessions 
such as:

o Field interfaces (e.g. stellar/ISM, molecular cloud/Galactic, 
  galaxies/clusters)
o Coherent emission processes (e.g. planetary, stellar, pulsar ...)
o Field generation mechanisms for different scales
o Field topologies
o Probes of magnetic fields (method oriented - e.g. pulsar rotation 
  measures, extragalactic sources, Zeeman splitting ...)

We will cover half of the registration fee for students.

Thanks,
George Hobbs, Robert Braun and Dominic Schnitzeler

ATTENTION GRAD STUDENTS AND EARLY POSTDOCS: LUNGRADCON 2010
 
The first-ever Lunar Graduate Conference (LunGradCon 2010) will be held 
on Sunday, July 18, 2010 at the NASA Ames Research Center (ARC). In 
conjunction with the NASA Lunar Science Forum at ARC, LunGradCon will 
provide an opportunity for grad students and early-career postdocs to 
present their research on lunar science in a friendly environment among 
their peers. In addition to oral presentations, opportunities for 
networking with fellow grad students and postdocs, as well as senior 
members of the NASA Lunar Science Institute, will be provided. A 
limited amount of funding will be provided for travel and lodging 
costs.
