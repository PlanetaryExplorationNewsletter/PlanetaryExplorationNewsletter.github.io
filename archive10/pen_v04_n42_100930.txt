[NASA SPECIAL] HEADS UP ON A FABULOUS UPCOMING EVENT CELEBRATING 
50 YEARS OF EXO/ASTROBIOLOGY: SEEING SIGNES OF LIFE!

From: James L. Green, Director Planetary Science Division, NASA
Headquarters.

I wanted to bring to your attention a FREE event that NASA and Lockheed
Martin is sponsoring on Thursday, October 14th. The event is a day-long
symposium on NASA's Exobiology and Astrobiology Program. It is all 
about the origins and discoveries in this field over the past 50 years 
and the exciting ways three fundamental questions will be answered in 
the next 50 years: How does life begin and evolve? Is there life beyond 
Earth and, if so, how can we detect it?  What is the future of life on 
Earth and in the universe?  
 
The event will be held on Thursday, October 14, 2010 (8 AM - 5 PM 
Eastern) at the Lockheed Martin Global Vision Center, Arlington, VA 
22202. Confirmed speakers include:  Baruch S. Blumberg, The Honorable 
Daniel S. Goldin, David Grinspoon, Noel Hinners, James Lovelock, Lynn 
Margulis, and Steve Squyres.
  
RSVPs are required by COB (Eastern) Oct 7th to  exosymposium@gmail.com  
and seating is limited. (Non-US Citizens: please provide nationality, 
along with passport number/expiration date.) For those of you that 
cannot attend the event, it will be shown live on NASA TV and also on 
Livestream.
