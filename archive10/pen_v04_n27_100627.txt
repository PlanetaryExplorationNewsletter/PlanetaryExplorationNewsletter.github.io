FOURTH MSL LANDING SITE WORKSHOP- CALL FOR PRESENTATIONS

You are invited to participate in the fourth landing site workshop for
the 2011 Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) rover mission. The workshop 
will be held near Pasadena, California, on September 27-29, 2010. The 
workshop will be held at the DoubleTree Hotel in Monrovia, California, 
and will occur before the MEPAG meeting to be held at the same 
location.

This workshop will focus on the outstanding science questions, surface 
characteristics, and relative merits of the final MSL landing sites 
remaining under consideration. Outcomes will include a list of testable 
hypotheses that can be accomplished at each site using the MSL science 
payload. A fifth landing site workshop will be held in the early spring 
of 2011 that will be the final workshop prior to selection of the site 
by NASA Headquarters.

All members of the scientific community are encouraged to participate. 
Persons wishing to make a presentation at the workshop should provide 
a title and brief (several-sentence) description of the content to 
both:

John Grant (grantj@si.edu)

and

Matt Golombek (mgolombek@jpl.nasa.gov) 

by August 1, 2010. The input from the science community is critical to 
identification and evaluation of optimal landing sites for the MSL.

[NASA] DRAFT AOS FOR EXPLORER MISSIONS AND EXPLORER MISSIONS OF 
OPPORTUNITY RELEASED FOR COMMUNITY COMMENT

NASA Science Mission Directorate (SMD) released two draft solicitations 
for community review and comment: the Draft Explorer 2010 Announcement 
of Opportunity (AO) and the Draft Explorer 2010 Missions of Opportunity 
(MO) Program Element Appendix (PEA) for the Stand Alone Missions of 
Opportunity Notice (SALMON) AO. The full text of the both draft 
solicitations will be available at:

http://nspires.nasaprs.com/

Explorer Investigations must address NASA's goals to advance the 
understanding of the Sun and its effects on Earth and the Solar System 
and/or to discover the origin, structure, evolution, and destiny of the 
universe and search for Earth-like planets. 

NASA will hold an Explorer Program Workshop (including a Potential 
Bidders Conference) on Tuesday, July 13, 2010 in the Washington, DC 
area to provide an overview of the Draft Explorer 2010 AO and the 
Draft Explorer 2010 MO PEA and to address any questions. Information 
about the Conference will be made available on the Explorer Program 
Acquisition website at:

http://explorers.larc.nasa.gov/EX/

The comment period for the Draft Explorer 2010 AO and the Draft 
Explorer 2010 MO PEA ends on July 16, 2010.

[NASA] NSPIRES CONTRACT CHANGE AND INTERRUPTIONS IN SERVICE

NASA recently competed contract that handles work associated with peer 
review, and the new contract is to begin at the start of August.  In 
July, during the transition period, there will be some interruption of 
services as offices, people, and computers are moved. For example: 

1) From 8 am EDT Thursday June 24 to 7 am Monday June 28, 2010, the 
regular NSPIRES help desk email (nspires-help@nasaprs.com) will not be 
working.  To email the NSPIRES help desk during this period, please 
use nspires@gst.com. The help desk phone number (202-479-9376) will 
continue to be available during this period. 

2) The NSPIRES computer system, through which proposals and NOIs are
submitted, will be moving and thus offline from Thursday July 15 
through Sunday July 18. As a result the NOI due date for Appendix A.24 
AOURD  has been changed to Thursday, July 22 and the due dates for B.8 
HDEE and C.20 ASTEP have been changed to Friday, July 23.  The 
amendments making these changes, and also the delay of due date for 
proposals to Appendix D.5, the GALEX GI program can all be found at:

FINAL ANNOUNCEMENT FOR EJSM INSTRUMENT WORKSHOP
 
NASA and ESA are organizing the 4th Europa Jupiter System Mission 
(EJSM) Instrument Workshop on July 26-29, 2010 at the Sheraton 
Universal Hotel in Universal City, California. See: 

http://opfm.jpl.nasa.gov/InstrumentWorkshop/ 

for details registration.  A limited number of sleeping rooms remain 
available until July 7.
 
This workshop will be covering programmatic and technical aspects 
related to the EJSM mission, including Jovian radiation models, the 
JEO system reliability model, radiation shielding modeling results, 
others.  Two classes will be offered as part of the workshop: a 
tutorial on the Jovian environments, and Planetary Protection 
considerations for instrument development. 

This workshop will provide relevant programmatic information on the 
instrument Announcement of Opportunity (AO), which is expected to be 
released in early 2011.  New information will be provided on the 
selection and review process, AO policies, and other topics. Attendees 
will have the opportunity to provide feedback to NASA that will be 
considered when finalizing the AO.  Potential instrument providers 
to EJSM are strongly encouraged to attend this workshop.  
 
Participants who are interested in presenting items of interest to the 
general instrument community may submit an abstract summarizing their 
capabilities.
