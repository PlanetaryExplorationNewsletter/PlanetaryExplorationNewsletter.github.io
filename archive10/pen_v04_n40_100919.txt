ANNOUNCEMENT FROM ASTRONOMY EDUCATION REVIEW

Astronomy Education Review (AER), the web-based journal/magazine about 
astronomy education and outreach, continues to publish papers and 
articles as it moves into the second half of its 9th volume.  There is 
currently no charge for reading or downloading the full articles in 
the journal and there are no page charges to publish, thanks to the 
generosity of its publisher, the American Astronomical Society

You can see an entire current issue and all past volumes at: 

http://aer.aip.org 

AER actively solicits interesting papers and articles on all aspects 
of astronomy and space science education and outreach. All papers are 
refereed, and a set of guidelines for contributing to AER is available 
on the site.  Thomas Hockey of the University of Northern Iowa is the 
Editor in Chief.  Andrew Fraknoi of Foothill College serves as Senior 
Editorial Advisor.  Judy Johnson of the American Astronomical  Society 
is the Managing Editor.

The journal is pleased to announce that it is actively soliciting 
papers and articles on results from the International Year of 
Astronomy.  Such papers should meet the regular guidelines of the 
journal's sections, and should, whenever possible, include analysis 
that goes beyond a single project or single institution.

This MEPAG meeting will be held the two days immediately following the 
4th MSL Landing Site Workshop (September 27-29, 2010), and at the same 
location, and all members of the community are welcome to attend both.

We will begin the meeting at 8:30 a.m.  The meeting is open to all 
members of the Mars science community, specifically including our
international colleagues.  In addition, we will broadcast the meeting
via WebEx for those who cannot attend in person.

[NASA] DECADAL SURVEY REQUEST:  SOLAR AND SPACE PHYSICS (HELIOPHYSICS)

THE National Research Council will assess the scientific priorities of 
the U.S. solar and space physics research enterprise for 2013-2022. 
Details regarding this "decadal survey" may be found at:

http://www.nas.edu/ssb

or 

http://tinyurl.com/2b4e4sh
 
We strongly encourage you to write a concept paper that can range 
from a specific instrument or mission proposal to a white paper that 
examines an issue of broad concern to the community. 

For full consideration, submissions must be received no later than 
5:00 p.m. EST on Friday, November 12, 2010.
 
Your ideas will provide the foundation for an exciting and compelling 
program that the Steering Committee, Panel members and others 
involved in the Decadal process will endeavor to advocate as strongly 
as possible. 

Questions may be addressed to the Decadal Survey Committee at:
