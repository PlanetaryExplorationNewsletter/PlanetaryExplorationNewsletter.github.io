PLANETARY SCIENCE TECHNOLOGY REVIEW (PSTR)

A "Planetary Science Technology Review" (PSTR) panel was chartered 
early this year by the Planetary Science Division (PSD) at NASA 
headquarters. The panel's primary purpose is to assist the PSD in 
developing a coordinated/integrated technology development plan that 
will better utilize technology resources. To accomplish this, the 
panel has reviewed current technology development activities and 
will be suggesting process and policy changes to address any 
weaknesses. This panel compliments the work of the PSS working group 
addressing planetary SR&T and will rely on the Planetary Science 
Decadal Survey to identify what technologies will need to be invested 
in. 

The panel has concluded its assessment phase and has made some 
observations and identified some issues. The panel is now soliciting 
ideas from the community for the best solutions. A list of 
observations and issues along with a simple two question survey has 
been developed to facilitate input. The list and survey can be found 
on PSTR website at:

http://spaceflightsystems.grc.nasa.gov/PlanetaryScience/

Please take a moment to provide your suggestions on how to improve 
the development of planetary technologies. This is an important and 
easy opportunity to make a positive change.

Thank you in advance for your contribution.

GRADUATE STUDENTS ELIGIBLE FOR THE LPI CAREER DEVELOPMENT AWARD! 

The Lunar and Planetary Institute (LPI) is proud to announce its 
fourth LPI Career Development Award, which is open to both U.S. and 
non-U.S. applicants. This award will be given to graduate students who 
have submitted a first-author abstract for presentation at the 42nd 
Lunar and Planetary Science Conference (LPSC), at The Woodlands 
Waterway Marriott Hotel & Convention Center (Woodlands,TX).  A travel 
stipend of $800.00 will be awarded to the top applicants to help cover 
their travel expenses for attending the LPSC in March. 

Application deadline: January 7, 2011. 
Send applications to:
   Dr. Stephen Mackwell
   c/o Claudia Quintana
   3600 Bay Area Boulevard
   Houston TX 77058-1113
   cquintana@hou.usra.edu 

Awards will be based on a review of the application materials by a 
panel of lunar and planetary scientists. Applications must include: 
   * Letter outlining why the applicant would like to participate at 
     the LPSC and what he or she will contribute to the conference 
   * Letter of recommendation from his or her research advisor 
   * Copy of the first-author abstract 
   * Curriculum Vita for the applicant 

All contributions to the endowment fund are tax-deductible. Please 
contact Dr. Stephen Mackwell (mackwell@lpi.usra.edu) if you are 
interested in contributing to this effort.

NEW-HORIZONS WORKSHOP ON ICY SURFACE PROCESSES

August 30 - 31, 2011, Lowell Observatory, Flagstaff, Arizona.

The principal objective of this workshop is to review the state of
knowledge and present new ideas pertaining to the geological and
geochemical processes that operate on the surfaces of icy worlds, 
with the goal of aiding our understanding of the Pluto system during 
the first reconnaissance in 2015 by NASA's New Horizons mission. In
recognition of the Lowell Observatory's key role in the discovery of 
the Pluto System, Lowell is hosting the workshop on the old 
Observatory grounds. Co-sponsored by SwRI and NASA ARC.

The workshop will focus on Solar System solid body icy surfaces
(anywhere in the Solar System) and the physical and geological 
processes that shape icy landforms and mobilize surface materials. 
Subjects covered include possible analogs for surfaces of Pluto 
system, compositional considerations, the physical properties of 
surface materials, landscape and volatile origin and evolution, the 
implications for other KBOs, and the plans and expected datasets 
resulting from Pluto system investigations by the NHâ€™s mission. 
There will be invited and contributed talks, details to follow.

Participation is open to anyone, limited to ~75 researchers.

MICROSYMPOSIUM 52: THE MOON: THE FIRST BILLION YEARS OF CRUSTAL 
EVOLUTION

The Woodlands Waterway Marriot, The Woodlands, Texas, March 5-6, 2011
Sponsored by:Brown University, The Vernadsky Institute, Brown/MIT NLSI.

The goal of Microsymposium 52 is to present a summary of new 
discoveries, and to bring together representatives of the lunar 
geology, mineralogy, petrology, spectroscopy, geochemistry and 
geophysics communities to ponder the implications of these new 
findings for the next generation of significant scientific problems.  
A critical aspect of this discussion will be to assess the implications 
of this new perspective for future modes and destinations for robotic 
exploration of the Moon.

The Microsymposium will be held at the Woodlands Waterway Marriot Hotel 
and Convention Center, March 5-6th, 2011, at the site of the 42nd Lunar 
and Planetary Science Conference taking place March 7-11, 2011.  
Microsymposium 52 will begin at 1 PM on Saturday, March 5th, and will 
conclude Sunday, March 6th, by 1 PM.

to express interest. 

Co-conveners: Carle Pieters, Maria Zuber, James Head, Alexander 
Basilevsky, Michael Wyatt and Harald Hiesinger

2011 NEXT-GENERATION SUBORBITAL RESEARCHERS CONFERENCE (NSRC-2011)

Registration: Open
Abstract deadline: 23 November

Hosted by Space Florida, the University of Central Florida, and the
Southwest Research Institute, NSRC is *the* meeting for researchers 
and educators wanting to participate in, learn about, and contribute 
to the new era of frequent and inexpensive commercial, reusable 
suborbital spaceflight and it's research and education applications.

Over 350 people attended the 2010 meeting in Boulder, and still more 
are expected at the coming meeting.

This year's meeting will put particular interest on suborbital
applications in education and public outreach, astronomy and planetary 
science space life sciences, microgravity sciences, and international 
interest in next-gen suborbital.

The conference will take place on the University of Central Florida
campus Feb 28 to Mar 2, 2011. Reserve your seat by registering soon at:

http://nsrc.swri.org/

For those wishing to speak, abstracts are due in less than two weeks--
the deadline is Nov 23rd; just follow the links at the web site to
submit.

The sponsors and the conveners of NSRC-2011 look forward to your
participation in three days of informative sessions, panels, and
networking in beautiful Orlando, beginning February 28th.
