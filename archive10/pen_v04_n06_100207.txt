URGENT!  OUTER PLANETS ASSESSMENT GROUP (OPAG) MEETING DELAYED DUE TO
SNOW

The OPAG meeting will be delayed to a 1 pm eastern start time on 
Monday, February 8, at the St. Regis Hotel in Washington, DC, due to 
the snow storm that blanketed the area Friday and Saturday.  An updated 
"Snow Agenda" is currently being worked with the speakers and this 
revised agenda will be available Monday morning prior to the afternoon 
start of the meeting.  This agenda will move the EJSM science breakout 
sessions to Tuesday, with Monday's agenda covering a variety of 
informational presentations.  It is hoped that this arrangement will 
allow those affected by the blizzard to participate remotely via Webex 
on Monday afternoon with the expectation that traffic disruptions 
(automobile, metro trains, and air) will be resolved to allow 
face-to-face interaction for the EJSM breakouts on Tuesday.
 
To participate via Webex you must first register at 

https://nasa.webex.com/nasa/j.php?ED=123724607&RG=1&UID=0&RT=
MiMxMQ%3D%3D

You will subsequently receive a confirmation email with instructions 
for joining the meeting.

TENURE-TRACK RESEARCH POSITION - LOWELL OBSERVATORY

Lowell Observatory invites applications for one or more tenure-track 
research positions in astronomy, astrophysics, or planetary science.  
Over the next several years, Lowell expects to expand its scientific 
and engineering staff to maximize the scientific potential of the 
4.2-meter Discovery Channel Telescope.  We seek individuals with 
demonstrated records of research accomplishment and clear evidence or 
potential for obtaining independent grant support.  A Ph.D. in 
astronomy, planetary science, or a closely related field is required.  
All areas of astronomical and planetary research will be considered.  
Individuals with background and interest in instrument development are 
encouraged to apply.  Applications from candidates at all career levels 
will be considered.  For more information about the DCT and Lowell 
facilities, see
