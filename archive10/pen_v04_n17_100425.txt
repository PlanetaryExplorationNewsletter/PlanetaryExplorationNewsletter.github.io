their peers. In addition to oral presentations, opportunities for 
networking with fellow grad students and postdocs, as well as senior 
members of the NASA Lunar Science Institute, will be provided. A

NEW "DISCOVERIES IN PLANETARY SCIENCE" CLASSROOM POWERPOINTS AVAILABLE

The DPS Education Subcommittee announces the 3rd release of
"Discoveries in Planetary Science" Classroom Powerpoints, covering
five new topics:

- Venus' Active Volcanism
- Martian Glaciers
- Titan Lakes
- Explaining Iapetus
- Waterworld at 40 Lightyears?

These are succinct summaries of discoveries too recent to appear in
"Intro Astronomy" college textbooks; each set consists of just three
slides to be shown: the discovery itself, a basic explanation based on
good planetary science, and the "big picture" context. Another page for 
further information is provided as well. Powerpoints and PDF's can be 
downloaded from http://dps.aas.org/education/dpsdisc.

Feedback from the community on how these slide sets are used and
received is welcomed, and will be used to improve future releases. 
Planetary scientists with recent or upcoming results of broad interest 
are encouraged to submit them for consideration by providing an initial 
draft using the template provided on the website. For more information, 
contact Nick Schneider & Dave Brain at dpsdisc@aas.org
