PLANETARY SCIENTIST POSITION - MAX PLANK INSTITUTE

The Max Planck Institute for Solar System Research at Katlenburg-Lindau 
(Germany, http://www.mps.mpg.de/) is looking for a Planetary Scientist 
in the field of planetary geology for the DAWN Framing Camera Project. 
The successful candidate will join the DAWN FC group at MPS and will 
be involved in the analysis of the images that the DAWN spacecraft will 
return from 4 Vesta. In addition, the successful candidate will be 
involved in the FC operations planning and data archiving process. The 
ideal candidate has several years of experience in the following areas: 
Planetary (surface) geology and mineralogy, asteroid science or related 
science (e.g. Moon, Mars), image processing and analysis of remote 
sensed data using e.g. ENVI or ISIS. Details about the open position 
and the application process can be found on our homepage:

POSTDOCTORAL OR SCIENTIST POSITION IN SMALL BODIES RESEARCH AT 
UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND

The Small Bodies Group in the Department of Astronomy at the University 
of Maryland, College Park, has an opening available for a Post-Doctoral 
Researcher in small bodies.  Our group specializes in remote sensing 
observations, both ground-based and space-based, and theoretical
modeling primarily of comets, asteroids, and the Moon.  Our group is 
involved with the planning, acquisition and analysis stages on the 
following missions and instrument teams:  EPOXI, the M3 spectrometer on 
Chandrayaan, Stardust NExT, Rosetta, and the Russian Phobos sample
return mission.  We also operate the Small Bodies Node of NASA's
Planetary Data System, which maintains all mission data related to
small bodies in the Solar System.

Applicants in search of 1) a limited-term post-doctoral position OR 
2) a longer-term position in which they bring and continue to apply for 
grants are welcome.

Anyone interested in applying should send a CV, a short statement 
(no more than 2 pages) of research goals and their connection to 
research carried out at Maryland, and arrange for three letters of 
reference to be sent electronically to both: 

ma@astro.umd.edu 

and 

sbjob@astro.umd.edu

Applications received by July 15, 2010 will receive full consideration.

[NASA PDS] MARS RECONNAISSANCE ORBITER DATA RELEASE 13

The Planetary Data System (PDS) is pleased to announce a new delivery 
of Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO) data for the following 
instruments: CRISM, HiRISE, MCS, RSS, SHARAD, and SPICE.

No CTX/MARCI data are included in this release, as both instruments 
were off due to the spacecraft having been in safe mode for the 
delivery period.

In general, MRO Release 13 includes data collected August 9, 2009 
through November 8, 2009.    

The HiRISE Operations Center has released HiRISE image data acquired 
over the time period spanning January 17, 2010 through May 6, 2010 in 
the orbit range of 16,300 to 17,699.  This release contains 5 TB of 
image data in 75,032 products and 4 TB in 191,072 extra products.  
All HiRISE RDR data products for March 24, 2006 - June 27, 2007 
(Orbits 1 - 4,299) have been reprocessed (4,135 RDRs, with extras, 
totally 6.2 TB).

SPECIAL ISSUE OF PLANETARY AND SPACE SCIENCE - "TITAN THROUGH TIME"

A special issue of the journal Planetary and Space Science is currently
being arranged, on the theme of "Titan Through Time: Formation,
Evolution and Fate".

The issue was originally conceived to capture science presented at the
recent workshop held at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, April 6-8th
2010, with the same name.  However, the PSS special issue is open to 
any authors wishing to submit an original contribution related to the 
topic.  The theme is interpreted in a broad sense, encouraging articles 
on not only Titan data analysis and modeling, but also progress in key 
related scientific areas such as laboratory experimentation, which 
having an important bearing on the interpretation of Titan's history 
on daily, seasonal, climatic and cosmological timescales.

The deadline for article titles, author lists and abstracts (to
conor.a.nixon@nasa.gov) is June 30th. First submission of the complete
article is expected by August 31st: late submissions will be considered
for a regular issue of PSS. Articles should adhere to regular PSS
formatting, and authors will be informed of detailed submission
instructions in July.

We look forward to reviewing a wide range of contributions, and a very
successful PSS Special Issue on this exciting and topical theme.

BASIC SCIENCE OBSERVATIONS WITH SOFIA

The Call for Proposals for Basic Science observations with the 
Stratospheric Observatory For Infrared Astronomy (SOFIA) is now open. 
The deadline for responding to the call is Friday, July 30, 2010.

The Basic Science program will consist of about 75 hours of on-sky 
exposure with either the FORCAST mid-infrared camera or the GREAT 
sub-millimeter heterodyne spectrometer. The observing time is 
expected to take place during a 2-3 month interval within the time 
frame of March 1 through August 31, 2011.

Documents needed to consider observational possibilities and 
constraints, and to prepare and submit observing proposals, are at:

http://www.sofia.usra.edu/Science/proposals/basic_science

Those documents include the Call for Proposals, the SOFIA Observers 
Handbook for Early Science, the Early Science Calibration Plan, 
exposure estimation tools and tutorials and the "Reserved 
Observations Catalogs" for the two instruments (Call for Proposals, 
Appendix A).

Proposals are invited from the world scientific community. Successful 
proposers with U.S. professional affiliations will be eligible to 
receive funding to support the acquisition, analysis and publication 
of Basic Science data, consistent with other NASA-sponsored observing 
programs.

Please direct questions and comments to:

sofia_help@sofia.usra.edu

We look forward to your participation in this exciting research 
opportunity.
