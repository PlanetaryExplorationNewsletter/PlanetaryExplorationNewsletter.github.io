PASSING OF DONALD M. HUNTEN (1925-2010)

Planetary science suffered another loss this week with the passing of 
Donald M. Hunten, 85. He was a primary figure in the development of 
planetary atmospheres and a long-time professor at the Department of
Planetary Sciences, University of Arizona.

A memoriam is posted at:

NRC'S COMMITTEE ON PLANETARY PROTECTION STANDARDS FOR ICY BODIES IN 
THE OUTER SOLAR SYSTEM

The first meeting of the NRC's Committee on Planetary Protection 
Standards for Icy Bodies in the Outer Solar System will be held on 
31 January-2 February 2011 at the National Academies' Keck Center 
(500 Fifth St, NW) in Washington, D.C.  The committee's second and 
third meetings will be held in Irvine, California, on 16-18 March 
and 14-16 June.  The committee was established at the request of
NASA/SMD to develop and recommend planetary protection standards for 
future spacecraft missions to the icy bodies in the outer solar 
system (asteroids, satellites, Kuiper belt objects, and comets) in 
light of current scientific understanding and ongoing improvements 
in mission-enabling capabilities and technologies.  Many of the 
committee's sessions will be open to the community.

COMMITTEE ON THE ORIGINS AND EVOLUTION OF LIFE (COEL)

The next meeting of the Committee on the Origins and Evolution of 
Life (COEL) will be held 2-4 March 2011 at the Keck Center in 
Washington, D.C.  COEL is the standing committee of the Space 
Studies Board that organizes and provides oversight of studies on 
research opportunities and programs on the origin and evolution of 
life in the universe, including NASA's astrobiology program.  As 
usual, most of the committee's sessions are open to the community.

[NASA] A SOUTHERN HEMISPHERE LAUNCH OPPORTUNITY FOR SOUNDING ROCKET 
FLIGHTS

The Sounding Rocket Program is planning to provide launches from 
Woomera, Australia, in the fall of calendar year 2014 and again in 
the spring of calendar year 2016, subject to the availability of funds.
Investigators responding to the ROSES 10 Appendix B.4 (SHP) and D.3 
(APRA) solicitations may propose sounding rocket flights launched from 
this southern hemisphere site for either opportunity. Normal payload 
recovery is anticipated for flights using either the Black Brant IX or 
Black Brant XI launch vehicles. Go to:

http://nspires.nasaprs.com/ 

(select 'Solicitations' then 'Open Solicitations' then 'NNH10ZDA001N').

PHD STUDENT POSITION(S) IN GERMANY (EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES RESEARCH
SCHOOL - JACOBS UNIVERSITY BREMEN)

Fluid Escape on Earth and Mars: Landforms, Structures and Processes -
Project P25

The Earth System Sciences Research School (ESSReS), funded by the German
Helmholtz Association, offers positions for outstanding young scientists
in the topical field of earth system science. This PhD project aims at
understanding the geology subsurface fluid escape on fossil Earth
examples with relevance to Mars analogues, though an interdisciplinary
integrated observational and modelling approach, including the detailed
study of selected Mars fluid escape features and the field and remote
sensing analysis of ancient terrestrial fluid escape sites. This
position is hosted by Jacobs University, one of the three institutions
participating in the ESSReS School. Jacobs University is a highly
selective, international, residential university in Bremen. It was
founded in 2001 (supported by the city-state of Bremen, the University
of Bremen, and Rice University in Houston, Texas)

The selection of the candidates is academics and merit-based. Funding is
available for two of the three PhD projects Jacobs University is
hosting.
