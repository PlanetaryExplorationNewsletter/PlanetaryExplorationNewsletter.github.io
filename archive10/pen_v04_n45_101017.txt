FACULTY POSITION IN EXTRASOLAR PLANET STUDIES

The School of Earth and Space Exploration (SESE) at Arizona State 
University is seeking new faculty expertise in the study of the nature, 
formation, and evolution of extrasolar planets. Applicants with both 
observational and theoretical interests are being sought. Specific 
research areas might include but are not limited to: spectroscopy of 
planets and their host stars, novel techniques for searching for and 
characterizing exoplanets, planetary interior modeling, and planetary 
dynamics. The School is particularly interested in hiring faculty at 
the Assistant or Associate Professor level who aspire to leadership 
positions in large-scale space- and/or ground-based research 
initiatives. The successful candidate's appointment may begin as early 
as August 15, 2011.

Applications should include: 1) a cover letter that includes a 
description of the applicant's research and teaching interests and 
experience; 2) a current CV; and 3) the names, addresses and telephone 
numbers of three references. All materials should be submitted 
electronically, in PDF format, through the school's website: 

http://sese.asu.edu/opportunities-faculty 

Application reviews will begin on November 1 and continue until the 
position is filled. We encourage submission of complete applications 
no later than December 1, 2010.

POSTDOC FELLOWSHIPS AT ASU - SESE

The School of Earth and Space Exploration (SESE) at ASU invites 
applications for the Exploration Postdoctoral Fellowship Program. 
Research areas within SESE encompass astrophysics, cosmology, Earth 
science, climate science, planetary science, exploration systems 
engineering, and science education.  The Exploration Fellowship 
Program aims to provide opportunities for conducting research on 
cutting-edge topics and to foster interdisciplinary collaboration.

Applications must include a brief research proposal that has been 
discussed with prospective faculty sponsors.  Preference will be given 
to proposals including multiple focus areas within SESE and that will 
involve new collaborations.  Potential research topics span the full 
range of research interests of our faculty 
(http://sese.asu.edu/focus_areas), including key initiatives in the 
origin, evolution, and fate of the Universe, planetary bodies, 
Earth's surface environment, and life; and lifelong science and 
engineering education.

Applications are due December 31, 2010.  A full description of the 
application process is available at: 

http://sese.asu.edu/opportunities  

We expect to award up to 2 fellowships this year (typical start dates 
July 1 - September 1).

ASU is an equal opportunity/affirmative action employer that actively 
seeks diversity among applicants and promotes a diverse workforce.

GNIRS SYSTEM VERIFICATION

Dear Colleague,

The Gemini Observatory is delighted to invite the Gemini Community
to submit proposals for GNIRS System Verification (SV) observations
on the Gemini North Telescope. Twelve nights are available for SV
science during the period December 1, 2010 to March 31, 2011. The
goal of SV is to thoroughly test not only the capabilities of GNIRS,
but also test the entire system from observation definition to data
reduction and demonstrate to the community, through interesting and
challenging astronomy programs, the potential of GNIRS.  Note that
this opportunity to propose for GNIRS comes in addition to the
availability of GNIRS for regular proposals in 2011A.

The deadline for submitting proposals is before midnight HST on Monday
October 25 (6:00am EDT Tuesday October 26). Detailed information on
GNIRS SV and instructions for applying for SV time are available at:
  
http://www.gemini.edu/sciops/instruments/gnirs/system-verification

The GNIRS web pages contain detailed information about the
capabilities of the instrument.

The GNIRS instrument scientists, Tom Geballe and Rachel Mason
welcome questions about the instrument and the SV process.

Sincerely,

Verne V. Smith and Knut Olsen
NOAO
