IMA2010 SESSION: PLANETARY MINERALOGY - METEORITES, SHOCK METAMORPHISM,
AND MORE (PL121)

20th General Meeting of the International Mineralogical Association 
Budapest, Hungary 
August 21-27, 2010

Mineralogical and geochemical - including cosmochemical - studies of 
meteorites as tracers of early solar system evolution and impact 
processes, investigations of impactites from terrestrial impact 
structures, and possible distal ejecta layers are the subject of this 
session.

The session provides a forum for multidisciplinary discussion of solar 
system evolution, planetary development, impact processes and the 
products of catastrophic impact, and the link between large-scale 
impact events and extinction horizons in the biostratigraphic record. 
Of particular interest could be recent developments in shock 
metamorphism - especially regarding deformation caused in the 
low-shock pressure regime. Ore formation in impact settings and the 
related physicochemical processes could also be represented.

MAKE YOUR OWN SUGGESTIONS FOR HIRISE

The HiRISE Team has launched a new public suggestion tool, called  
HiWish: 

http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/releases/hiwish.php

You can suggest your own targets, as well as be notified when that  
suggestion is acquired and released to the PDS.

More details about HiWish can be found in the LPSC abstract: 

http://www.lpi.usra.edu/meetings/lpsc2010/pdf/2458.pdf

or you can just go straight there and start suggesting targets:

WORKSHOP: TITAN THROUGH TIME - EXTENSION OF ABSTRACT DEADLINE

[To be held at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, April 6-8th 2010]

The deadline for receipt of workshop abstracts has been extended 
through midnight EST Feb 8th 2010. Requests for oral presentations will
be given priority according to the order in which abstracts are 
received. Abstracts are suggested to be brief, about 300 words, and 
references extra as required.

and please check back regularly for forthcoming details regarding 
local accomodation and conference dinner arrangements.

We look forward to seeing you in April.

PODCAST SERIES FROM THE ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY OF THE PACIFIC

The web-site of the nonprofit Astronomical Society of the Pacific now 
provides two different series of podcasts involving interviews with 
and talks by astronomers that may be of interest to those who teach 
or deal with the public:

1) "Astronomy Behind the Headlines" features short interviews on 
astronomy and space science, and provides links to related resources 
and activities.  To listen to the latest episode, access related 
resource and subscribe via iTunes or XML, go to:

http://www.astrosociety.org/abh/  

Podcasts in the series include interviews with planetary astronomer 
Heidi Hammel and meteor expert and meteorite discoverer Peter 
Jenniskens.

2) "The Silicon Valley Astronomy Lectures" feature complete talks by 
noted astronomers, recorded in both audio-only and video 
formats.  Recordings of past speakers include Frank Drake, Geoff 
Marcy, Paul Kalas, Dale Cruikshank, Mark Showalter, David Morrison, 
and Nathalie Cabrol. You can find the audio podcasts, and 
instructions for getting to the video versions at:
