MAGNETOSPHERE FOR OUTER PLANETS CONFERENCE 2011

Tohoku University, Sendai, Japan on July 11-15, 2011.
(the next week of IUGG @ Melbourne, on 28 June - 7 July 2011)

Topics of the conference include all aspects of the magnetospheres of 
the outer planets, including aurorae, ionospheres, satellites, torus, 
and any comparative studies of these including exoplanets.

Planned Schedule (tbc):
  * Abstract Submission : Apr 29(Fri), 2011
  * Program issue       : May 13(Fri), 2011

CALL FOR ABSTRACTS, EGU SESSION: AURORA, AIRGLOW AND TRANSIENT 
LUMINOUS EVENTS IN PLANETARY ATMOSPHERES

Dear Colleagues,

We kindly invite you to submit an abstract to the joint session
PS7.2/AS4.16 Aurora, Airglow and Transient Luminous Events in Planetary
Atmospheres at EGU 2011 in Vienna (3-8 april). Abstracts are due 10
January 2011.

The goal of this session is to stimulate exchanges between the many
communities working on subjects involving all aspects of atmospheric
emissions encountered at Earth, planets and other planetary bodies
(satellites and comets) from the mesosphere to the exosphere.

Theoretical, observational, experimental as well as technical (including
but not limited to instruments, databases...) contributions are
encouraged. New results from space missions (Mars Express, Venus
Express, Akatsuki, Cassini) will be presented.

At the end of the session, a forum will be organized to discuss the
needs of the different communities, the expected improvements, future
missions and the possibility of more regular dedicated meetings.

More information, and abstract submission:

MOON MINERALOGY MAPPER (M3) DATA TUTORIAL AT 2010 AGU

December 13, 2010
 
With the first delivery of M3 data to the PDS, the M3 team, with the 
support of the Planetary Data System, is offering a comprehensive 
tutorial on accessing and using M3 data. Topics to be covered in the 
3 hour session includes searching and obtaining the relevant data via 
the PDS Orbital Data Explorer, an overview of the PDS M3 file 
structure, and insights into the various intricacies of working with 
the data. This overview is intended for researchers who have some prior 
experience with imaging spectrometer data, though the session is open 
to all who wish to attend. The tutorial will be held from 1 to 4 PM on 
Monday, December 13, at the San Francisco Marriott Marquis in Salon 12. 
Contact Noah.E.Petro@nasa.gov if you have any questions about the 
session.

PLANETARY GEOMORPHOLOGY SESSION, EGU

Does your work concern surface processes on planetary bodies 
(e.g. Venus, the Moon, Europa, Mars,...)? Or are you studying 
terrestrial analogues of planetary surface processes (dunes, rockfalls, 
impact craters, gullies, etc.)?

If the answer to either of these questions is 'yes' please consider 
submitting an abstract to the Planetary Geomorphology Session at EGU 
to be held 3-8 April 2011 in Vienna, Austria. Students/postdocs 
note that the deadline for financial support is rapidly approaching!

Please find more details on the session here:

http://meetingorganizer.copernicus.org/EGU2011/session/7410

3rd December 2010 is the deadline for ALL support applications to be 
considered. More details at: 

http://meetings.copernicus.org/egu2011/support_and_distinction/
financial_support.html

Please note that each abstract submitted will incur an 'Abstract 
Processing Charge' - this will be deducted from the conference fee 
on registration. Details on how to submit an abstract are here:

Please contact me at susan.conway@univ-nantes.fr  if you have any 
questions about this session. We look forward to welcoming you to 
Vienna in the spring.
