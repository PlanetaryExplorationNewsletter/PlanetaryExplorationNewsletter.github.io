FALL AGU SESSION P22: ON THE NATURE, ORIGIN, AND EVOLUTION OF WATER ON  
AIRLESS BODIES

Water, as H2O or OH, has now been detected on extra-terrestrial 
objects from the inner Solar System through the Kuiper Belt and is 
predicted on many more.  Water is significant for many reasons, 
including understanding the origin of life, chemical and geologic 
processes, and resource utilization. In this session we solicit 
presentations discussing the fundamental characteristics and processes 
relevant to understanding H2O and OH, including topics on their 
formation and stability on the surfaces of airless bodies in the Solar 
System, interaction with the environment (i.e., other volatiles or 
mineral grains, thermal and non-thermal processes), mechanical and 
chemical properties, and detection techniques and limits, among others.

Please consider submitting an abstract.  We look forward to seeing you 
at the meeting.

DPS EARLY CAREER SCIENTIST WORKSHOP

Sunday, October 3, 2010 9am-5pm
DPS 2010 Pasadena
Room 211

This workshop is open to all graduate students and recent post-
graduates interested in learning more about advancing their career in 
planetary science. The full day workshop will include a networking 
event, a panel on career pathways, and a tutorial on proposal writing.

Lunch and refreshments will be provided to participants. Pre-
registration is required for this event due to space limitations. 
Please contact Rachel Mastrapa (Rachel.M.Mastrapa@nasa.gov) to 
pre-register. This event is sponsored by NASA and the DPS Committee.

MSL LANDING SITE WORKSHOP PROGRAM AVAILABLE ONLINE

The program for the 4th MSL Landing Site Workshop is now available
online at:

http://marsoweb.nas.nasa.gov/landingsites/ 

and

http://webgis.wr.usgs.gov/msl/

The workshop will be held September 27-29, 2010, at the DoubleTree 
Hotel in Monrovia, California, and will be just before the MEPAG 
meeting to be held at the same location.  There is no registration or 
fee to attend.  All members of the scientific community are 
encouraged to participate in this important activity.

This workshop is expected to focus on the outstanding science 
questions, surface characteristics, and relative merits of the final 
MSL landing sites remaining under consideration.  Outcomes will 
include a list of testable hypotheses that can be accomplished at 
each site using the MSL science payload.

We look forward to your continued involvement in these activities!

Sincerely,
John Grant and Matt Golombek
Co-Chairs, Mars Landing Site Steering Committee

[NASA] DUE DATE DELAYED FOR ASTROBIOLOGY:  EXOBIOLOGY AND EVOLUTIONARY 
BIOLOGY PROGRAM

Programmatic schedule conflicts at NASA Headquarters have postponed the 
EXO peer review and hence the date when SMD must have proposals. A 
corresponding deferral of the EXO due date will provide the community 
additional time to prepare proposals. The proposal due date for EXO has 
been changed to Friday, October 22, 2010.

Information on the science scope of Astrobiology can be found at:

http://astrobiology.arc.nasa.gov/

This Amendment to the NASA Research Announcement "Research 
Opportunities in Space and Earth Sciences (ROSES) 2010"
(NNH10ZDA001N) has been posted on the NASA research opportunity 
homepage at:

[NASA] KECK TELESCOPES CALL FOR 2011A PROPOSALS

NASA is soliciting proposals to use the Keck Telescopes for the 2011A 
observing semester (February 2011 - August 2011).  NASA intends the 
use of the Keck telescopes to be highly strategic in support of 
on-going missions and/or high priority, long term science goals.  Thus 
NASA allows disciplines including exoplanets and solar system topics, 
galactic and extragalactic topics as well as cosmology and high energy 
astrophysics.  This semester and onward, there is limited time 
available for observations of targets based on public Kepler data or 
data obtained through the Kepler Guest Observer programs.  The call 
for CoRoT Key Science has been extended to semester 2012B.  Proposals 
are also sought in the following discipline areas: (1) investigations 
in support of EXOPLANET EXPLORATION science goals and missions; 
(2) investigations of our own SOLAR SYSTEM; (3) investigations in 
support of COSMIC ORIGINS science goals and missions; 
(4) investigations in support of PHYSICS OF THE COSMOS science goals 
and missions; and (5) direct MISSION SUPPORT.
 
All proposals are due on 16 September 2010 at 4 pm PDT.  Please see:

OUTER PLANETS ASSESSMENT GROUP MEETING

The OPAG meeting is coming up!  The meeting will take place 
Sept. 16-17 at the Millennium Harvest House in Boulder, CO.  The bulk 
of the meeting will focus on the upcoming Announcement of Opportunity 
for instruments for the Jupiter Europa Orbiter.  This is an excellent 
opportunity not only to hear details about potential AO parameters and
policies but also to provide NASA with your feedback on those policies.  
The Program Scientist, Curt Niebur, is looking forward to extended 
discussion and debate about this AO - this is your chance to learn 
about the AO and exert influence on its contents.
