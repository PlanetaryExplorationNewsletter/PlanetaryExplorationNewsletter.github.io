[NASA] DUE DATE CHANGE FOR KEPLER GUEST OBSERVER PROGRAM

The Kepler Guest Observer Program solicits proposals for the 
acquisition and analysis of new scientific data from the Kepler 
mission, which is the tenth mission launched under NASA's Discovery
Program. During its 3.5-year prime mission, Kepler will continuously 
monitor a ~100 square degree field-of-view (FOV) in the Cygnus region
(alpha=19h 22m 40s, delta=44deg 30' 00''), with the objective of 
photometrically detecting transits of Earth-size planets in the 
habitable zones (HZ) of stars in the solar neighborhood. The
instrument's high-precision photometry capability, with two available 
cadence modes (1 minute and 30-minute), provides a powerful tool
for asteroseismology research and other variability analyses of both 
Galactic and extragalactic sources.

The due date for proposal submission is now 11:59 pm EST Dec 17, 2010.

The Planetary Data System (PDS) is pleased to announce a new delivery 
of Odyssey Data, Release 32, for the following instruments:

     GRS
     THEMIS
     SPICE
  
There are no GRS gamma spectra included in this release. The gamma 
sensor has stopped returning data. The HEND and Neutron Spectrometer 
sensors are still operating.

We are pleased to announce that the previously-advertised special issue
of Planetary and Space Science "Titan Through Time" has received a very
strong response from the Titan research community and we anticipate a
full issue. It may be possible to accomodate a small number of
additional submissions: any further abstracts (due June 30th) should be
submitted immediately (to conor.a.nixon@nasa.gov).

The journal portal will open in the last week of July (a notice will be
sent with details) and first submissions are due August 31st, 
conforming to normal PSS formats. All details will be updated regularly 
at this site:

[NASA] ROSES-10 AMENDMENT 11: EARTH AND SPACE SCIENCE EXPERIMENTS 
USING COMMERCIAL REUSABLE SUBORBITAL RESEARCH VEHICLES AND THE ISS

For both Commercial reusable suborbital research (CRuSR) vehicle 
payloads and International Space Station (ISS) payloads, proposals 
must be submitted to the appropriate ROSES program element depending
on the science addressed by the proposed investigation. Proposals for
investigations using CRuSR vehicles and the ISS are solicited through
the Commercial Reusable Suborbital Research Platforms for Earth
Science program (Appendix A.27), Geospace Science program (Appendix
B.3), Solar and Heliospheric Science program (Appendix B.4),
Planetary Astronomy program (Appendix C.5), and the Astrophysics
Research and Analysis program (Appendix D.3).

2010 GSA ANNUAL MEETING SESSION

T107: Field Geology on Other Planets: An Emerging Science

It is probably not well known in the geoscience community that we 
have actually begun to do true exploration field geology on other 
planetary bodies. Field geologic studies, including sampling, both 
human and robotic, have now been done on the surface of the Moon. 
On Mars we have now done robotic geologic transects on the surface 
and reconnaissance geologic mapping. Even orbital imaging and 
multispectral instruments in orbit around other bodies are providing 
what amount to "air photos" and high-resolution spot remote sensing 
at outcrop levels of resolution.

This session will explore the status of past, present, and future 
studies of planetary surfaces from the perspective of field geology. 
Presentations will examine complex geologic relations on other planets 
that have been determined through in situ and through near-remote 
sensing studies of samples, outcrops, and terrains.

Abstract Deadline: August 10
