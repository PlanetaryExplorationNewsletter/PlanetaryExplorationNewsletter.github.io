MESSENGER POSTDOCTORAL RESEARCHER

The Department of Geological Sciences: 

http://geology.case.edu

at Case Western Reserve University is seeking applications for a 
postdoctoral researcher to work on data collected by the MESSENGER 
mission to Mercury. Individuals with interest in working on an active 
planetary spacecraft mission and with geophysics and/or tectonics 
expertise are encouraged to apply.   Candidates interested in 
tectonics and lithospheric structure, planetary interior structure, 
mantle convection or core dynamics, particularly those with experience 
working with gravity, topography, imaging or magnetic field data sets 
will be given preference.  The Department and the University maintain 
high-performance computing facilities that will be available for 
postdoctoral modeling and data analysis investigations. Applications 
received by September 21, 2010 will receive full consideration,
though applications will be accepted until the position is filled.  
The position requires a Ph.D. at the time of appointment and is 
available for one year with the possibility of renewal for another 
year.  Additional information and application requirements are 
available at:

http://ow.ly/2ucwE

Applications and inquiries may be directed to Prof. Steven A. Hauck, 
II at messenger-postdoc@case.edu. CWRU is committed to Equal 
Opportunity and Diversity.  Women, veterans, members of 
underrepresented minority groups, and individuals with disabilities 
are encouraged to apply.

4TH INTERNATIONAL WORKSHOP ON THE MARS ATMOSPHERE: MODELLING AND 
OBSERVATIONS

Dear all,

We confirm the "4th international workshop on the Mars atmosphere: 
modelling and observations" will take place on February 8-11 2011
in Paris, France.

Abstract deadline: November 26, 2010

More information will be posted on:

http://www-mars.lmd.jussieu.fr/paris2011/

Please spread the word,
We look forward to seeing you in Paris!
Best regards

Francois and the organizing comittee

[NASA] CANCELLATION OF THE GALEX GUEST INVESTIGATOR PROGRAM

The GALEX Guest Investigator Program solicits proposals for the
acquisition and analysis of new scientific data from the GALEX
Evolution Explorer (GALEX) and for the prioritization of observations
in the GALEX Legacy Survey (GLS).

The GALEX Guest Investigator Program (GALEX GI), will not be solicited 
in ROSES 2010. Structural changes to the GALEX Program derived from 
the recommendations by the 2010 Astrophysics Senior Review, resulted 
in the decision not to solicit further Guest Investigator programs 
for GALEX.  The report of the 2010 Astrophysics Senior Review is 
available at:

http://science.nasa.gov/astrophysics/2010-senior-review/

GALEX will continue to collect survey data, and proposals for GALEX
archival research may be submitted to the Astrophysics Data 
Program.

This Amendment to the NASA ROSES 2010 is posted at:

http://nspires.nasaprs.com/

(select "Solicitations" then "Open Solicitations" then "NNH10ZDA001N"). 

Questions regarding the GALEX GI Program may be addressed to:

UPCOMING OPAG MEETING VIDEO FEED

The upcoming OPAG meeting being held September 16-17 will be accessible 
to remote participants using WebEx.  A video feed will provide live 
coverage of the speakers and the presentations being given and a 
separate teleconference line will provide the audio.  To participate, 
visit:

https://nasa.webex.com

enter the appropriate meeting number, and click on the "Register" 
button near the bottom of the webpage. After registering the system 
will immediately send you an email with the meeting password, which 
you can enter on the webpage to log in to the meeting.  Alternatively, 
you may simply follow the directions in the email you receive 
(please note that since this is an automatically generated email 
some spam filters may intercept it).  Teleconference instructions 
will be provided in WebEx after you log in to the meeting.
 
Meeting number for Thursday, September 16:  999 706 032
 
Meeting number for Wednesday, September 17:  994 514 924
 
You can save time by setting up WebEx Meeting Manager, on Windows

CASSINI/RPWS/HFR RADIO DATA BROWSE TOOL

During the Cassini/MAPS (Magnetosphere And Plasma Science working 
group) meeting in Meudon, France (April 2010), we announced a public 
Cassini/RPWS/HFR radio data browse tool, which is now open on the 
LESIA/RPWS website:

http://www.lesia.obspm.fr/kronos 

(follow the "Browse HFR data" link)
or go directly to:

http://www.lesia.obspm.fr/kronos/public_browse.php

This tool provides browsable access to daily summary plots of various 
radio observables (raw power, flux density, circular polarization) 
with the option to overplot SKR (auroral Saturn Kilometric Radiation) 
burst phases predicted by available Saturn longitude systems (SLS-3, 
or empirical Northern/Southern SKR phase, as described on the website).

Please contact baptiste.cecconi@obspm.fr for any issue.

Regards,

Baptiste Cecconi, Laurent Lamy and Philippe Zarka.
