AGU SESSION: MINERALOGICAL STUDIES OF IMPACT CRATERS

http://www.agu.org/meetings/fm10/program/scientific_session_search.php
?show=detail&sessid=544

P02: Mineralogical Studies of Impact Craters: Exhumed Crust, 
Hydrothermal Processes, and Post-Impact Weathering

Impact craters sometimes contain unique mineralogy associated with 
central peaks, exposures in crater rims, and ejecta. Alteration 
mineralogy in impact craters can correspond to previously altered 
basement rock uplifted/exhumed from depth, hydrothermal alteration 
associated with the impact, or post-impact chemical weathering 
facilitated by shock and fragmentation. Presentations discussing any 
of these topics, dealing with field observations, remote sensing 
studies, modeling, or experimental work are solicited for this session.

AGU SESSION: FLUVIAL MORPHOLOGY AND PAST CLIMATE ON PLANET MARS

Please consider submiting an abstract to session EP 17: Fluvial 
Morphology and Past Climate on Planet Mars at the Fall 2010 American 
Geophysical Union Conference, abstract submission deadline 
September 2nd. See 

http://www.agu.org/meetings/fm10/

Convenors: Germari de Villiers and Maarten Kleinhans, Fac. of
Geosciences, Universiteit Utrecht, the Netherlands

High resolution images and digital elevation models have stimulated
detailed work on fluvial morphology on Mars, ranging from gullies to
channels, alluvial fans and fan deltas, and the mega-outflow channels. 
Yet, basic formative processes are still heavily debated, such as the 
role of groundwater sapping and precipitation, or fan and delta 
formation. Also the magnitude, duration and timing of activity are 
rather variable. The underlying nature of the past hydrology remains 
therefore poorly understood. This session aims to bring together 
fluvial morphological studies by remote sensing, modelling, 
experimentation and analogues on Earth conducted to unravel the past 
climate of Mars.

AGU SESSION: SOUTH POLE-AITKEN BASIN, NEW INSIGHTS

We would like to invite contributions from the planetary community to 
Fall AGU session P21: South Pole-Aitken Basin, New Insights.

As the largest and oldest of the recognizable basins on the Moon, the 
South Pole-Aitken Basin (SPA) holds many keys to understanding the 
impact history, crustal formation, and global distribution of crustal 
materials. Data from previous lunar missions showed the interior of the 
basin to be unique. However, it is the data from the most recent lunar 
missions that provide the clearest views of the composition, age of 
surface units, and structure of  SPA's interior. We invite submissions 
focusing on SPA that cover a range of topics, from models of SPA 
formation to data from recent lunar missions to petrologic modeling of 
how compositions in SPA fit into models of lunar crust formation.

The deadline to submit an abstract is to AGU is 02 September 2010 
- 23:59 Eastern Daylight Time (EDT) or 03:59+1 GMT.

AGU SESSION: EYES ON ENCELADUS

Conveners:  Carolyn Porco and Chris McKay

This special session (P05) continues a successful 5-year-long AGU 
tradition to join planetary scientists and astrobiologists involved in 
the study of Saturn's moon Enceladus for a close-up look at this active 
body.

In the past 6 years, Cassini has made several very close flybys of 
Enceladus, and several more are planned during Cassini's upcoming 
'Solstice' mission.  Observational and theoretical results accumulated 
thus far indicate a high likelihood that this body houses within it a 
liquid-water, organics-rich environment. 

In this session, we will focus on the most recent observational, 
theoretical and modeling results on the chemistry, state and dynamics 
of Enceladus' jets and plumes, the moon's thermal and interior state 
(including its putative south-polar sea), geologic activity, as well 
as its astrobiological potential.  (New results from the 2010 Cassini 
flybys of Enceladus focused on these research areas should be directed 
to this session.)  As in years past, we look forward to a popular and 
stimulating discussion.

[NASA] PDS RELEASES PHOENIX ROBOTIC ARM DELIVERED DATA
 
The Planetary Data System announces the release of the Phoenix Robotic 
Arm Derived Data Set. This data set consists of RA scoop tip position 
data and components of force for both the RA on Phoenix and the RA in 
the Payload Interoperability Testbed at JPL. These data have been 
derived from raw RA telemetry data, which are not archived in PDS due 
to ITAR restrictions. 

To access this data, please visit the following link:

STARDUST SAMPLE CATALOG

The new Stardust Sample Catalog is finally on line at:

http://curator.jsc.nasa.gov/stardust/catalog/
 
We are still entering data received from Stardust investigators, and we 
welcome any Stardust sample analysis results you have produced. If you 
have any comments, suggestions, or if you see any problems with the 
Catalog please contact the Catalog Manager directly at 
nancy.s.todd@nasa.gov

EXPEDITED STARDUST SAMPLE TEM SAMPLE ALLOCATION POLICY

Successive (rolling) allocation of grids for TEM analysis by 
researchers with TEM expertise will be routinely approved in batches 
of 1 to 2 grids from up to 5 particles at a time, i.e., 10 or fewer 
grids. 
 
These grids may be either samples already in the catalog or from new 
particles, although existing TEM grids can be allocated much more 
rapidly. 
 
One batch (10 or fewer grids) will be allocated to a PI at a time. The 
first batch must be returned to the collection by the PI, and summary 
reports must be submitted to and approved by the Curator and the 
Stardust Sample Allocation Committee, prior to allocation of the a new 
batch of grids. The summary reports will be input into the Stardust 
Sample Catalog. 
 
As we have been doing from day one, one grid from each particle will be 
held in reserve by the Curator for posterity.

[NASA] DISCOVERY 2010 AO NEW DATA REQUIREMENT AND DELAY OF DUE DATE

The NASA Announcement of Opportunity (AO) NNH10ZDA007O, "Discovery 
2010," has been amended to add a new requirement for provision of 
sufficient data to permit an independent assessment of the proposed 
mission design and trajectory.

Requirement B-30A has been added to require provision of sufficient 
data to permit an independent assessment of the proposed mission 
design and trajectory. Recognizing the late date of this additional 
requirement, these additional data may be provided in a file or files 
on the CD containing the electronic version of the proposal. There is 
no requirement that these data also be included in the hardcopy 
proposal.

To accommodate the late date of this additional requirement, the 
proposal due date has been extended by one week.  Proposals are due 
on September 10, 2010.

Questions concerning the Discovery 2010 AO may be addressed to 

Dr.  Michael H. New 
(202) 358-1766

AMELIA EARHART FELLOWSHIP

Zonta International is a service organization with a mission to advance 
the status of women, worldwide.  They established the Amelia Earhart 
Fellowships in 1938 and since then, Zonta has awarded 1,297 of these 
Fellowships, totaling US$7 million, to women from 64 countries.  

The Amelia Earhart Fellowship is awarded annually to women pursuing 
Ph.D./doctoral degrees in aerospace-related sciences and 
aerospace-related engineering. These fields include planetary science. 
The Fellowship of US$10,000, awarded to 35 Fellows around the globe 
each year, may be used at any university or college offering accredited 
post-graduate courses and degrees in these fields. Women of any 
nationality pursuing a Ph.D./doctoral degree who demonstrate a superior 
academic record in the field of aerospace-related sciences and 
aerospace-related engineering are eligible. Please note that 
post-doctoral research programs are not eligible for the Fellowship. 
Applications for the 2011 Fellowships must be received or post-marked 
by 15 November 2010 to be considered.
