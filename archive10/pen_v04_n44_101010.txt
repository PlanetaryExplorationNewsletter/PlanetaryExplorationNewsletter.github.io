PASSING OF FRANK J. STADERMANN

Frank Stadermann passed away on October 4, 2010, after suffering a 
cerebral hemorrhage. He was 48 years old. Stadermann was a senior 
research scientist in physics, member of the Laboratory for Space 
Sciences, and director of the NanoSIMS and Auger laboratories at 
Washington University in St. Louis.  Stadermann developed techniques 
for NanoSIMS measurements in TEM sections, which allowed for the first 
time correlated mineralogical and isotopic studies on a submicrometer 
scale. This work led to the first direct isotopic measurement of 
"presolar grains within presolar grains" (200-nanometer TiC crystals 
embedded in low-density supernova graphite spheres). He also discovered 
the first presolar corundum and SiC grains in IDPs. He served as a 
sample advisor for the Stardust mission, and the analysis of cometary 
particles was an important focus of his research.  His analyses during 
the preliminary examination of dust particles from Comet Wild-2 returned 
by the Stardust space probe led to the discovery of a presolar grain 
among the returned cometary samples.

PASSING OF AUDOUIN CHARLES DOLLFUS

French astronomer and aeronaut Audouin Dollfus passed away on October 
1, 2010 in Versailles, France, at the age of 85.

He contributed to the study of the Sun by creating a coronograph that 
was used by many spacecraft missions.  In 1966 he discovered Janus, 
the tenth satellite of Saturn, and asteroid 2451 bears his name.

In 1955, Dollfus' analysis of lunar dust using polarimetry allowed him 
to deduce the basaltic nature of the lunar soil and provided expertise 
for the design of the astronauts' boots. He contributed to the analysis 
of the lunar samples returned by the Apollo program and collaborated 
with NASA on the Ranger and the Venus Mariner programs and with the 
Soviets for their Mars-5 mission in 1973. He created the International 
Center for Planetary Photography at Meudon.

Dollfus designed balloon prototypes that allowed him to take a telescope 
up to 6000 meters in the air. On April 24, 1959, he reached a height of 
14,000 meters in an airtight capsule suspended from 102 balloons, and 
originated the study of astronomy from space. The data he collected 
during that flight allowed him to infer the existence of water on Mars.

[NASA] REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI)

In February 2011, the Deep Impact spacecraft will complete its mission 
(renamed EPOXI) for a study of extrasolar planets during its cruise to 
encounter Comet Hartley 2.

This Request for Information (RFI) solicits input from the broad space 
science community that would contribute to NASA's study of possible 
new uses for the NASA Deep Impact/EPOXI spacecraft beyond its current 
mission and would support NASA's science objectives in any of SMD's 
research disciplines (Astrophysics, Earth Science, Heliophysics, and 
Planetary Science). Responses to this RFI will be used to inform 
NASA's program planning.

The RFI is posted on the NASA research opportunity homepage at:
 
http://nspires.nasaprs.com/ 

(select "Solicitations" then "Open 
Solicitations" then "NNH11ZDA003L").

The response date is November 5, 2010.  For further information on 
this RFI, please contact:

[NASA PDS] CASSINI ISS AND VIMS DATA RELEASE 23

The Imaging Node of the Planetary Data System has published the Cassini 
Imaging Science System (ISS) volumes coiss_2058 and coiss_2059 and 
Cassini Visual Infrared Mapping Spectrometer (VIMS) volumes covims_0039 
and covims_0040.  These can be found on the Imaging Node website at 
URL: 

http://pds-imaging.jpl.nasa.gov/data/cassini/cassini_orbiter/

These volumes contain all the Cassini ISS and VIMS data released as 
part of the Cassini Data Archive Release 23.  The Imaging Node is now 
serving all the Cassini imaging data through December 31, 2009.

INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION:  THE NEXT DECADE CONFERENCE

The American Astronautical Society (AAS) and the Kennedy Space Center 
are sponsoring  the "International Space Station:  The Next Decade" 
national conference on November 16-17 at the Radisson Resort, Cape 
Canaveral, Florida.  The Conference will begin with a panel discussion 
between the ISS International Partner Program Managers discussing the 
importance of the ISS in the next decade.  It will continue with panel 
discussions focusing on ISS utilization and research, including the 
ISS as a National Lab, preparing for exploration, research and 
development opportunities and results, and transportation options in 
the post-Shuttle era.  NASA Administrator Charlie Bolden and Florida's
Lt. Governor Jeff Kottkamp have been invited as keynote and luncheon 
speakers.  A visual tour of the ISS will be hosted by an experienced 
ISS Expedition crewmember and the Conference will close with a 
conversation with the on-orbit ISS crew.   Earlybird discounted 
registration is available until October 10th at:

[NASA] ANNOUNCEMENT FOR MEMBERSHIP ON THE WFIRST MISSION SCIENCE 
DEFINITION TEAM

Applications are invited for membership on the Science Definition Team 
(SDT) for the Wide-Field Infrared Survey Telescope (WFIRST) mission, a 
strategic mission sponsored by NASA's Astrophysics Division, 
recommended as the top priority large project by the National Research 
Council's Decadal Survey of Astronomy and Astrophysics, entitled "New 
Worlds, New Horizons in Astronomy and Astrophysics" (the Astro2010 
Decadal Survey, available at:
 
http://www.nap.edu/catalog.php?record_id=12951)

The members of the WFIRST SDT will provide NASA with scientific 
assistance during preliminary concept definition (Pre-Phase A) 
activities.  Near-term activities of the SDT members will focus 
primarily on assessing the scientific approach to investigating the 
goals of the WFIRST space mission as outlined by the Astro2010 Decadal 
Survey.

Participation in the WFIRST SDT will be open to all qualified and 
interested individuals.

Questions or comments may be addressed to the NASA WFIRST Program

The European Space Agency (ESA) is issuing a Call for Proposals for a 
medium-size mission opportunity for a launch in 2022 as part of ESA's 
Cosmic Vision 2015-2025:

http://sci.esa.int/2010_M_Call/

NASA is not participating in the solicitation, but ESA program 
decisions that ultimately flow from the Call may provide cooperative 
opportunities that could advance progress toward NASA science goals.

Proposals are due December 10, 2010.

Any questions on NASA's policy regarding the ESA Call for Proposals 
may be addressed to Dr. Paul Hertz, Chief Scientist, Science Mission 
Directorate, NASA

[NASA] SOLICITATION FOR NASA SCIENCE TEAM MEMBERS FOR ESA'S EUCLID MISSION

NASA Science Mission Directorate (SMD) intends to release a 
solicitation for NASA-selected members of the Science Team for ESA's 
Euclid mission for dark energy research.  This solicitation will be 
released as an amendment to the Research Opportunities in Space and 
Earth Sciences 2010 (ROSES-2010) NASA Research Announcement (NRA).

The selected PI will serve on the Euclid Science Team and have full 
data rights to the Euclid flight. 

The solicitation will describe a Euclid Reference Mission design that 
demonstrates the existence of a configuration that meets the science 
goals, as well as Euclid's programmatic constraints, to which 
proposers must strictly adhere in the proposal of science 
investigations.  The Euclid Reference Mission will include a 
visible-light imager and a near-infrared spectrograph / photometer. 
It is anticipated that, subsequent to selection of the Euclid Science 
Team, the Euclid design may evolve slightly from the Euclid 
Reference Mission.

Questions or comments about this Community Announcement on NASA's 
Euclid solicitation may be addressed to the NASA Euclid Program
