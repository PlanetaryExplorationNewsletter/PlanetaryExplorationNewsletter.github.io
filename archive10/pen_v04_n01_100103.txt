With this amendment, NASA Science Mission Directorate (SMD) 
Announcement of Opportunity (AO) NNH08ZDA009O, "Stand Alone Missions 
of Opportunity Notice (SALMON)," is amended to establish a new Program
Element Appendix (PEA) as Appendix H6, ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter 
Instruments Investigations.  This PEA solicits Principal Investigator 
(PI)-led instrument science investigations for the ExoMars 2016 Orbiter
mission.  The ExoMars 2016 Orbiter mission is a joint ESA-NASA mission.
Further information on the ExoMars 2016 Orbiter mission is available 
at:

EXPLORATION FELLOWSHIP PROGRAM

The School of Earth and Space Exploration (SESE) at Arizona State
University invites applications for the Exploration Postdoctoral
Fellowship Program. SESE's core mission is to integrate science and
engineering to provide a better understanding of our world and beyond.
Research areas within SESE encompass astrophysics, cosmology, Earth
science, climate science, planetary science, exploration systems
engineering, and science education. The Exploration Fellowship Program
aims to provide opportunities for conducting research on cutting-edge
topics and to foster interdisciplinary collaboration.

Applications must include a brief research proposal. Preference will be
given to proposals including multiple focus areas within SESE and that
will involve new collaborations among our faculty. Potential research
topics span the full range of research interests of our faculty
(http://sese.asu.edu/focus_areas), including key initiatives in the
origin, evolution, and fate of the Universe, planetary bodies, Earth's
surface environment, and life; and lifelong science and engineering
education.

Evaluation of applications begins February 15, 2010; applications will
be accepted until positions are filled. Up to 5 fellowships will be
awarded this year. Details of the application process are available
online (http://sese.asu.edu/opportunities).

ASU is an equal opportunity/affirmative action employer that actively
seeks diversity among applicants and promotes a diverse workforce.
