U.S. NATIONAL SPACE POLICY RELEASED

The Obama administration has released a document on its space policy 
for the United States. It may be found at:

http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files
/national_space_policy_6-28-10.pdf

and its accompanying fact sheet at:

http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office
/fact-sheet-national-space-policy

It is interesting to note some of the language in this document 
relevant to solar system exploration: 

"The Administrator shall: ...

Maintain a sustained robotic presence in the solar system to: conduct 
scientific investigations of other planetary bodies; demonstrate new 
technologies; and scout locations for future human missions;

Continue a strong program of space science for observations, research, 
and analysis of our Sun, solar system, and universe to enhance 
knowledge of the cosmos, further our understanding of fundamental 
natural and physical sciences, understand the conditions that may 
support the development of life, and search for planetary bodies and 
Earth-like planets in orbit around other stars; and

Pursue capabilities, in cooperation with other departments, agencies, 
and commercial partners, to detect, track, catalog, and characterize 
near-Earth objects to reduce the risk of harm to humans from an 
unexpected impact on our planet and to identify potentially 
resource-rich planetary objects."

We note the importance given to solar system research as a stand-alone 
activity.
