MARS GLOBAL REFERENCE ATMOSPHERIC MODEL (MARS-GRAM)

Mars Global Reference Atmospheric Model (Mars-GRAM) is an engineering-
level atmospheric model developed by Marshall Space Flight Center's 
Natural Environments Branch.  Mars-GRAM is widely used for diverse 
mission applications. Applications include systems design, performance 
analysis, and operations planning for aerobraking, entry descent and 
landing, and aerocapture.  From 0-80 km altitude, Mars-GRAM is based 
on NASA Ames Mars General Circulation Model (MGCM), while above 80 km 
it is based on Mars Thermospheric General Circulation Model (MTGCM).  
Mars-GRAM and MGCM use surface topography from Mars Global Surveyor 
Mars Orbiting Laser Altimeter (MOLA), with altitudes referenced to 
the MOLA constant potential surface (areoid).  Mars-GRAM has recently 
been reclassified as public domain software.  As a result of this 
change, Mars-GRAM is now available upon request through the Space 
Environments and Effects (SEE) program website at:

[NASA] DISCOVERY AND NEW FRONTIERS PROGRAM "SPACE SCHOOL MUSICAL"

The solar system comes alive in "Space School Musical," a new 
35-minute musical play about the solar system that  combines science 
with music, fun lyrics, and simple choreography.  Students in school, 
afterschool programs and summer camp can move, groove, and laugh 
along with the planets, moons, meteors, comets, asteroids and even 
some rockin' scientists as they sing, dance and serve up the freshest
facts in the galaxy.  Kids can watch the video, learn the songs, and 
even perform the play themselves. There are links to hands-on 
activities, videos highlighting young, diverse scientists, engineers
and interns at JPL, and a glossary of the terms used in the songs.  
Created and produced by KidTribe for NASA's Discovery and New 
Frontiers Programs, "Space School Musical" is is available as a free 
resource for everyone at:

[NASA PDS]  LUNAR RECONNAISSANCE ORBITER (LRO) RELEASE 2

The NASA Planetary Data System announces the second release of data 
from the LRO mission. In general, this release includes raw and derived
products for data acquired from December 15, 2009 to March 14, 2010.  
It also includes revised versions of products from Release 1 for LOLA, 
LEND, Diviner, LAMP, and LROC. Details are given in the ERRATA.TXT 
file in each archive.

Data sets from the following experiments are included: CRaTER, DLRE, 
LAMP, LEND, LOLA, LROC, and Mini-RF.

Mini-RF data is delayed and will be available by June 22.

LAMP data are expected to be released on June 17.

LRO data are archived at the PDS Planetary Plasma Interactions (PPI), 
Geosciences, Imaging, and Navigation and Ancillary Information (NAIF) 
Nodes. The data may be accessed from these nodes' web sites and from 
the main PDS home page:

http://pds.nasa.gov/ 
or 
http://pds.nasa.gov/subscription_service/SS-20100615.html

The Planetary Image Atlas at the Imaging Node allows selection of LRO 
data by specific search criteria.

http://pds-imaging.jpl.nasa.gov/search/lro/

The Lunar Orbital Data Explorer at the Geosciences Node allows 
searching and downloading of LRO data and other lunar orbital data 
sets (Clementine and Lunar Prospector).

POSTDOCTORAL POSITION IN COSMOCHEMISTRY AT WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY
 
The Laboratory for the Space Sciences at Washington in St. Louis has 
an opening for a post-doctoral research fellow in cosmochemistry. The 
Laboratory for the Space Sciences is engaged in multi-disciplinary 
research concentrating on the microanalysis of extraterrestrial 
materials including meteorites, interplanetary dust particles, and 
samples from comets, with special emphasis on the analysis of presolar
grains (samples of stardust). We are seeking a scientist to participate
in the study of silicon carbide grains of a supernova origin. The work 
will involve chemical separation of presolar grains and isotopic 
analysis by secondary ion mass spectrometry (NanoSIMS). For a general 
overview of our research program please visit our website: 

http://presolar.wustl.edu/
 
The fellowship is open beginning of September 2010 and is for two 
years. Applicants are expected to have a PhD and research experience 
in experimental areas related to cosmochemistry.
 
Anyone interested in the position should send a CV, list of 
publication, a short statement of research goals and arrange for 
three letters of recommendation, sent separately. Please send 
applications via e-mail to Ernst Zinner ekz@wustl.edu

In addition, several graduate student positions will also be 
available in our group.
