BROWN UNIVERSITY: ASSISTANT PROFESSOR, GEOLOGICAL SCIENCES
PLANETARY GEOLOGICAL PROCESSES

The Department of Geological Sciences, Brown University: 

http://www.geo.brown.edu/

invites applications for a tenure-track faculty position in Crustal 
Processes in Early Planetary History.  Candidates should complement 
our current planetary science strengths in crustal evolution, 
volcanism, impact cratering, and remote sensing and departmental 
focus areas of Earth system history, tectonophysics, and Earth 
materials and processes. Major emerging important areas of
investigation center on one or more of the following areas: the
chemistry and mineralogy of early planetary processes, weathering and
alteration processes, processes associated with the interaction of
water and planetary crustal materials, quantitative geomorphology of
planetary processes, the geologic record of planetary climate change,
early planetary history and chronology, the astrobiological
implications of such processes, and interactions of planetary crustal
materials with the planetary atmospheric and space environments.

Appointment is anticipated at the Assistant Professor level, although
exceptional circumstances would warrant appointment at a higher level.

To apply, please email in PDF format a letter of interest (addressed
to Jack Mustard, Chair of the Search Committee), a current CV,
statements of research and teaching interests, and three references to
Ruth_Crane@brown.edu. More details can be found at:

ESA POSTDOCTORAL FELLOWSHIPS IN SPACE SCIENCE

The European Space Agency awards several postdoctoral fellowships each
year. The aim of these fellowships is to provide young scientists, 
holding a PhD or the equivalent degree, with the means of performing 
space science research in fields related to the ESA Science Programme. 
Areas of research include planetary science, astronomy and 
astrophysics, solar and solar-terrestrial science, plasma physics and 
fundamental physics. Fellowships have a duration of two years, tenable 
at the European Space Research and Technology Centre (ESTEC) in 
Noordwijk, Netherlands, or at the European Space Astronomy Centre 
(ESAC) in Villafranca del Castillo, near Madrid, Spain.

Applications are now solicited for fellowships to begin in the summer 
or fall of 2011. Preference will be given to applications submitted 
by candidates within five years of receiving their PhD. Candidates 
not holding a PhD yet are encouraged to apply, but must provide 
evidence of receiving their degree before starting the fellowship.

Application deadline is 1 October 2010.

More information on the ESA Research Fellowship programme in Space
Science and the application form can be found online at:

Questions on the scientific aspects can be sent to Dr. Guido De Marchi

[NASA] DUE DATE DELAYED FOR C.16 PLANETARY INSTRUMENT DEFINITION AND 
DEVELOPMENT (PIDD) PROGRAM

The Planetary Instrument Definition and Development (PIDD) program
solicits proposals to define and develop scientific instruments or
components of such instruments to the point where the instruments may
be proposed in response to future announcements of flight opportunity
without additional extensive technology development.

This amendment delays the proposal due date for C.16 Planetary
Instrument Definition and Development (PIDD) Program. Programmatic
schedule conflicts at NASA Headquarters have postponed the PIDD peer
review and hence the date when SMD must have proposals. A
corresponding deferral of the PIDD due date will provide the
community additional time to prepare proposals. The proposal due date
for PIDD has been changed to Friday, September 17, 2010. 

This Amendment has been posted on the NASA research opportunity 
homepage at:

http://nspires.nasaprs.com/ 

(select "Solicitations" then "Open Solicitations" then "NNH10ZDA001N"). 

You can now track amendments, clarifications and corrections to ROSES 
and subscribe to an RSS feed at:

[NASA] NASA OPENS ONLINE VOTING FOR NEXT DESERT RATS EXPLORATION SITE

NASA is inviting the public to choose an area in northern Arizona where
explorers will conduct part of the annual Desert Research and 
Technology Studies, known as Desert RATS.

From July 27 through Aug. 8, space enthusiasts can vote where to send 
the Desert RATS team, which includes engineers, scientists and 
astronauts. To cast your vote, visit:

http://desertrats2010.arc.nasa.gov

The website features interactive panoramic images of lava, rocks and 
desert for the public to choose as the most interesting destination to 
explore. The location that receives the most votes will be announced 
Aug. 16. Astronauts will visit that site to perform field geology and 
collect rock samples.

The Desert Rats 2010 mission also involves field testing two space 
exploration vehicles, which could allow astronauts to spend two or more 
weeks living, working, and traveling across different planets. 
Astronauts will use two such vehicles to explore a lava flow and test 
data collection methods, communications protocols, mission operations, 
and advanced technology. Desert RATS is sponsored by NASA's Exploration 
Systems Mission Directorate in Washington.

also corrected minor errors in EDR and RDR data product labels. This 
interim release consists of revised versions of all previously released
RDR products and their PDS labels, and revised EDR labels only 
(not data files).

The revised data are available from the LOLA Data Node via the Lunar 
Orbital Data Explorer:

http://ode.rsl.wustl.edu/moon/

and from the PDS Geosciences Node:

http://pds-geosciences.wustl.edu 

A revised product can be identified by the keyword 
PRODUCT_VERSION_ID = "V1.03" in its label.

FALL AGU SESSION ON OUTER SATELLITE TOPOGRAPHY

The Shape of Things to Come: Using Topography to Investigate the 
Evolution of Outer Solar System Satellites

Topographic data provide insight into recent and ancient subsurface 
and surface processes and properties, on global and local scales. 
Spacecraft data have enabled some surface topography of outer planet 
satellites to be determined. We invite abstracts on any topic in which 
topography plays a role. These may describe theoretical investigations, 
laboratory studies or data analysis and could include (but are not 
limited to): processes that create or erase surface topography at any 
scale, such as convection, contraction, or relaxation; digital terrain 
and shape models; surface processes such as landscape erosion; and 
predictions of surface or subsurface topography for future missions.

For more information about the session, please contact 
Wes.Patterson@jhuapl.edu or Louise.Prockter@jhuapl.edu.
