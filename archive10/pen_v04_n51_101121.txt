PASSING OF BRIAN MARSDEN

It is with deep sorrow that we announce the death of Brian Marsden 
today, long-time director of the Minor Planet Center, well-known small 
bodies scientist, and central figure in the great planet debate. An 
obituary has been posted at:

[NASA] REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS FOR MARS EXPLORATION PROGRAM CRITICAL 
DATA PRODUCTS PROGRAM (ROUND VI)

The Mars Exploration Program has issued a Request for Proposal 
(round VI) for the Critical Data Products program.  This RFP provides 
support to develop a number of scientifically high-priority landing 
sites on Mars that will form an initial list for future landed 
missions.  

Details of the RFPs are posted at:

[NASA] NEW PROPOSAL OPPORTUNITY IN THE KEPLER PARTICIPATING SCIENTISTS 
PROGRAM

This program element solicits proposals for the Kepler Participating 
Scientists Program (PSP).  The Kepler PSP is designed to augment the 
skill set of the Kepler Science Team, thereby enabling it to more 
effectively execute the science program of the mission. Participating 
Scientists serve as members of the Kepler Science Team and participate 
in Science Team activities such as data processing and analysis, 
transit candidate follow-up and characterization, and publication.

The Kepler PSP is complementary to, but distinct from, the Kepler Guest 
Observer (GO) program.  

Notices of Intent to propose are due January 7, 2011. Proposals are due 
February 11, 2011. Table 2 and Table 3 of the Summary of Solicitation 
for this NRA have been updated to reflect this change.

This Amendment to the NASA Research Announcement "Research 
Opportunities in Space and Earth Sciences (ROSES) 2010" (NNH10ZDA001N) 
will be posted on the NASA research opportunity homepage at:

PLANETARY SCIENTIST STAFF POSITION

The Bear Fight Institute is seeking candidates for scientist staff 
positions and post-doctoral fellowships who have experience in studying 
the surfaces of Solar System objects and interpreting their origin and 
evolution. Current programs emphasize planning, operations, data 
analysis, disciplines associated with active and proposed space 
missions, and conducting research using multi and hyperspectral images. 
Experience is needed in data processing and analysis, and in associated 
science, mathematical and computer skills. Work is centered within a 
small research group near Winthrop, WA USA. Extensive domestic and 
international travel is often involved to participate in research team 
and professional society meetings, and for collaborative efforts with 
other research groups. Good writing and communication skills in English 
are necessary for preparing professional articles, progress reports, 
and writing proposals. Desired are those candidates in the early stages 
of their careers with developing research programs, or in mid to latter 
career stages interested in taking a leadership position. Position(s) 
could start immediately and is/are annually renewable dependent upon 
federal funding. Ph.D. in fields related to planetary science and the 
ability to work independently is required. Salary and benefits are 
competitive. See full job description and contact information under 
Opportunities at:

PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT EVENT SURVEY

Please respond to the survey linked below to prioritize professional 
development event topics for the next DPS meetings. The survey has one 
question, so it will take a short time to complete.  Keep in mind that 
professional development programs are for all members of the community.  
If there is a program that you would like to see, but it is not listed, 
please add it in the comments.

8TH INTERNATIONAL PLANETARY PROBE WORKSHOP

The 8th international planetary probe workshop will be held from 
June 6-10, 2011 in Portsmouth, VA.  The workshop will bring together
scientists, engineers, technologists, mission designers, space agency
leaders, and exceptional students for a focused discussion on solar
system destinations via in-situ missions.  The workshop will be 
preceded by a short course entitled "Atmospheric Flight Systems 
Technologies" from June 4-5, 2011.
