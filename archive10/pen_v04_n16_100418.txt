[NASA SPECIAL] NEW R&A LEAD POSITION AT PSD NOW OPEN

James L. Green, Director, Planetary Science Division
NASA Headquarters
 
I firmly believe that the best organization in planetary science can 
only begin with getting the best people working for the community at
NASA Headquarters. If you are one of those scientists who believes
that we could run a better Research and Analysis (R&A) program, 
then now is your chance to apply for the top R&A position in the
Planetary Science Division (PSD).
 
I have established a new, full-time, permanent civil servant position 
in PSD dedicated to the management of the R&A program.
 
To that end, we are seeking a Supervisory Space Scientist to manage 
a team of scientists and engineers and a significant portion of PSD's
research budget and program. If competitively selected, you will be
responsible for the overall management of the R&A program and staff,
including analyzing and working with the community to establish the 
program goals, and maintaining the highest ethical standards of
competition in all the PSD R&A programs. You will participate in 
fiscal and technical management, including formulating budgets and
assessing fiscal expenditures, and reporting this information and 
other metrics to the science community, to OMB and to Congress. As
a member of the PSD team you will be working with an outstanding 
group of dedicated staff.
 
The USAJobs Vacancy number is HQ10B0073. The position opened on April 
16, 2010, and closes on May 17, 2010. For instructions on how to 
apply and qualification requirements please access the full text
vacancy announcement at:

http://jobsearch.usajobs.gov/ftva.asp?opmcontrol=1878892

U.S. citizenship is required. All applications must be received no
later than midnight Eastern Time on the closing date of the 
announcement, and NASA is an Equal Opportunity Employer and Provider.

We have a number of exciting planetary mission milestones ahead,
especially in the next 18 months. Come help us lead in this new era
of discovery.

[NASA] PLANETARY SCIENCE SUMMER SCHOOL

DEADLINE: May 1, 2010

NASA is accepting applications from science and engineering post-docs,
recent Ph.D.s, and doctoral students for its 22nd Annual Planetary
Science Summer School, which will hold two separate sessions this 
summer (19-23 July and 2-6 August) at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in
Pasadena, California.

During the program, student teams will carry out the equivalent of an
early mission concept study, prepare a proposal authorization review
presentation, present it to a review board, and receive feedback. At 
the end of the week, students will have a clearer understanding of
the life cycle of a robotic space mission; relationships between 
mission design, cost, and schedule; and the tradeoffs necessary to 
stay within cost and schedule while preserving the quality of science.

Applications are due 1 May 2010. Partial financial support is available
for a limited number of individuals.
