[NASA SPECIAL] FROM: JAMES L. GREEN, DIRECTOR, PLANETARY SCIENCE
DIVISION, NASA HEADQUARTERS

For the fall AGU I wanted to let you know about an exciting session 
that is not in the normal planetary science listing. It is Session 
ED25: NASA's Year of the Solar System "Science Isn't Done Until It's 
Shared". We have a fabulous set of mission milestones coming up that 
will lead to, what I predict, are major new discoveries in planetary 
science. I know that many of you are taking part in these events and  
we owe it to the nation to let students and the public know what we  
are doing and what discoveries we make. This session will be one of  
the first times the science community will hear and discuss how our  
EPO efforts will be coordinated over the upcoming months and to build  
new connections that we may not have thought of yet.
 
To that end, I am requesting that each presenter communicate at least 
two things in their presentation: 1) what do we expected to learn and 
2) why should the public care? Abstracts are due on September 2nd.  
Please go to:

http://www.agu.org/meetings/fm10/

I hope to see you there. Here are the details on the session:

ED25. NASA's Year of the Solar System "Science Isn't Done Until 
It's Shared!" (Organizers: Daniella Scalice and Jackie Allen)

NASA's Year of the Solar System (YSS) is a celebration of Solar 
System mission milestones that will begin in fall, 2010 and 
continue for one Martian year (687 Earth days), ending in late 
summer, 2012. The breadth of Solar System bodies and missions 
involved is extensive, including EPOXI, Stardust-NeXT, Dawn, 
MESSENGER, Juno, MSL, MER, GRAIL, and LADEE, and all the major 
questions uniting Solar System investigations are in play. YSS is
a rare opportunity to enhance student learning about the Solar 
System, and engage the public in the exploration and excitement 
that is uniquely NASA.

This session will bring together Education and Public Outreach 
projects and programs that are making a contribution to YSS.

FALL AGU SESSION DI12: INTERIOR STRUCTURE AND EVOLUTION OF THE 
TERRESTRIAL PLANETS

The last 10 years have provided new light on the interior of 
terrestrial planets, including surprises such as the possibility of a 
liquid core on the Moon or the discovery of relatively recent 
volcanism on Mars. Their interior structures remain weakly constrained, 
with major uncertainties on their deep interior. This session aims to 
present the state of the art in our knowledge of the interior of the 
Moon, Mars, Mercury, and Venus, as well as the latest results of 
comparative planetary evolution, including the coupling between 
evolution, volatiles, and habitability. It will also be a forum for 
the latest results of recent spacecraft missions and the reprocessing 
efforts of the Apollo geophysical network.

Confirmed invited speakers are Maria Zuber (interiors of Moon and 
Mercury), Uli Christensen (planetary dynamos), Renee Weber (lunar 
core seismology), and Nori Namiki (Kaguya mission gravity results).

conveners:

FALL AGU SESSION GP09: PLANETARY AND METEORITE PALEOMAGNETISM AND ROCK
MAGNETISM

Please consider submitting an abstract.

Conveners:  Jerome Gattacceca and Benjamin Weiss

Paleomagnetic analyses of the growing planetary and asteroidal sample
suite and the availability of new magnetic surveys of planetary 
crustal magnetism are transforming our understanding of the thermal 
and magnetic evolution of asteroids and telluric planets. This session 
calls for contributions relating to three aspects of planetary 
magnetism: 1) Paleomagnetic studies of meteorites and returned samples 
and implications for planetary and early solar system evolution; 
2) Analyses of crustal magnetism on the Moon, planets and asteroids; 
and 3) Rock magnetic studies of extraterrestrial materials and their 
synthetic analogs, including magnetization acquisition and 
demagnetization processes.
 
The deadline to submit an abstract is to AGU is 02 September 2010
- 23:59 Eastern Daylight Time (EDT) or 03:59+1 GMT.

PLANETARY GEOMORPHOLOGY AT THE INTERNATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF 
GEOMORPHOLOGISTS

We are convening a session on planetary geomorphology at the 
International Association of Geomorphologists annual meeting in 
Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, Feb. 18-22, 2011.

We hope you will consider submitting an abstract to this session. We 
have been granted an abstract submission extension to September 30.

Submission information can be found in the 2nd circular at:

http://www.geomorph.org/main.html

If you submit, please copy either of us. We hope to see you there!

Thanks,
Rosaly Lopes and Jani Radebaugh

Accelerating volumes of data returned from orbiting spacecraft 
continue to reveal solar system worlds with geomorphic features 
as complex and interesting as those on Earth. Active and relict 
river channels, lakes, landslides, glaciers, volcanoes, dunes, 
mountains, and impact craters have all been discovered on other 
planetary bodies. These are commonly developed in of different 
materials, form at different rates, and involve different genetic 
processes than we observe on Earth. A clear understanding of the 
role of fundamental physical processes versus materials and rates 
requires a study of these features across the solar system. We 
invite papers discussing key morphologies found on planetary 
surfaces and comparisons with terrestrial analogs.

WORKSHOP GEOBIOLOGY IN SPACE EXPLORATION AND FIELD TRIP GEOMICROBIOLOGY
AND GEOLOGY FROM PRECAMBRIAN TO QUATERNARY

Venue Marrakech, Morocco

Dates: Workshop 7 - 9 February 2011, Field Trip 10-14 February 2011

http://www.irsps.unich.it/education/geoexp2011/

Geobiology in Space Exploration is a meeting of talks and discussions 
to understand the full range of the contributions of geobiology to 
space exploration and settlement. It has two core purposes: 
1) To contribute to building the community of people working in 
geobiology and applying it to space sciences and exploration, 
2) To develop a strategic document on the range of geobiology 
applications and possible space missions for ESA. The meeting is 
organized by the European Space Agency (ESA) Topical Team 
'Geomicrobiology for Space Settlement and Exploration (GESSE)'. 
The topical team was set up in 2009 to investigate and develop new 
opportunities for geobiology in space - from life detection to 
practical applications of geobiology and geomicrobiology in human 
space exploration. This meeting will be the fourth topical team 
meeting, but has been organised as a community workshop to achieve 
the objectives.

PLANETARY SCIENCE POWERPOINTS AND PDFS

Are you looking for some great slides or illustrations to use in your
classes this term? The Planetary Science Research Discoveries (PSRD) 
website has 30 powerpoint slide sets covering fundamental topics in 
planetary science. Each set has three to four slides that are 
annotated  with captions and notes, and are linked to PSRD articles 
that provide the full context, additional graphics, and references.
