[NASA SPECIAL] COMMUNITY INPUT ON PLANETARY RESEARCH AND ANALYSIS 
PROGRAMS REQUESTED
 
From: James L. Green, Director, Planetary Science Division, 
NASA Headquarters
 
The Discipline Scientists of the Planetary Science Division and I are 
always interested in improving the quality of the Division's Supporting 
Research and Technology (SR&T) programs.  The scientific community 
plays an essential role in this by ensuring the quality of funded work 
through the generous donation of your time in reviewing proposals 
submitted to these programs by your colleagues and by serving on 
various advisory panels, MOWGs and program assessment groups. There is 
now another way for you to help:
 
I invite you to participate in a survey on our SR&T Programs being 
conducted, at my request, by the Planetary Science Subcommittee. Please 
go to the following URL and give us your best thoughts. 
 
http://www.surveymonkey.com/s/nasa_planetary_research
 
Your responses to this survey will help the Division in the planning 
and management of these programs. This survey is scheduled to end on 
October 11, 2010 at 5 PM Eastern. The data and results (minus any of 
the requested personal information) will be published on our NASA HQ 
website (will announce the location in this and other community 
newsletters). Your participation in this survey is very much 
appreciated.
