USGS ASTROGEOLOGY SCIENCE CENTER DIRECTOR

The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) invites applications for a full-time 
permanent position located in Flagstaff, AZ.  The USGS seeks an 
established scientist of national reputation with demonstrated ability 
to develop, lead, and administrate the Astrogeology Science Center.

The Astrogeology Science Center conducts innovative, fundamental 
research that advances the fields of planetary cartography, geoscience, 
and remote sensing. Astrogeology also supports both spacecraft 
operations and data analysis through its ability to develop and 
maintain state-of-the-art software and techniques for scientific and 
cartographic analysis.

Applicants must be United States citizens. Ph.D. or equivalent 
experience is required.  Candidates need a strong background in 
research science, preferably the planetary sciences, and proven 
leadership skills in managing "soft-money" research organizations. 
Candidates with a strong publication record in the planetary sciences, 
experience managing project portfolios, and proven scientific 
leadership skills are highly encouraged to apply.

POSTDOCTORAL FELLOWSHIP IN LUNAR SCIENCE AND EXPLORATION: 
PETROLOGY AND GEOCHEMISTRY

 
Universities Space Research Association (USRA) invites applications for 
a postdoctoral fellowship in lunar science and exploration. The 
successful candidate will work at the Lunar and Planetary Institute 
(LPI) and use the analytical facilities at the adjacent NASA Johnson 
Space Center (JSC), joining Dr. David A. Kring and over two dozen other 
scientists in the new Center for Lunar Science and Exploration. The 
Center is one of seven national centers of excellence supported by 
NASA's Lunar Science Institute. See:

http://www.lpi.usra.ed/nlsi 

The main goals of the Center's activities are to address NASA's 
highest lunar science priorities, and to assist with a new generation 
of exploration activities in preparation of robotic and crewed 
landings. 
 
We invite applications from those with recent Ph.D.s in the fields of 
petrology and geochemistry. Previous experience with lunar samples 
and/or impact lithologies is advantageous, but not required.   
 
Questions should be directed to Dr. David A. Kring 
(kring@lpi.usra.edu). Send a curriculum vita with list of 
publications, a two to three page statement of research interests, and 
a list of three references to resume@hou.usra.edu.  There is no firm 
application deadline, although a review of applications will begin 
January 7, 2011.

DAWN MISSION SUPPORT: REQUEST FOR GROUND-BASED VESTOID PHOTOMETRY

Dear Colleagues.

Dr. Bonnie Buratti and I are members of the DAWN science team and we 
are in the process of generating a photometric model of 4 Vesta in 
anticipation of spacecraft rendezvous in August 2011.  Ground-based 
photometry of V-type asteroids (Vestoids) over a wide range of solar 
phase angles would be extremely useful in constraining our model.

We have identified three Vestoids that are well-placed for observation 
during spring of 2011:  1981 Midas, 4668 (1980 WF), and 137052 
(1998 VO3). All three are near-Earth asteroids and all three should be 
brighter than V~18 for a significant portion of their apparitions. 
4888 (1980 WF) remains near the ecliptic throughout the apparition 
while 137052 (1998 VO33) and 1981 Midas will be best observed from the 
northern and southern hemispheres, respectively.  Photometry would 
likely have to be accurate to 0.1 mag to be useful although more 
precise photometry (preferably to 0.01 mag) would allow us to subtract 
rotational lightcurve effects.

If you would like to join us in this project we would most welcome 
your help.  Please contact Michael.Hicks@jpl.nasa.gov and of course 
any collaborators would be coauthors on any publication that utilizes 
the data.

[NASA] PROPOSALS SOUGHT FOR TECHNOLOGY FLIGHT DEMONSTRATIONS AND 
INFORMATION ABOUT SUBORBITAL FLIGHT SERVICES

NASA Office of the Chief Technologist Flight Opportunities Program is 
seeking proposals from researchers interested in testing new 
technologies during suborbital flights. The agency also is requesting 
information from commercial suborbital reusable launch vehicle 
providers and commercial payload integrators about carrying the 
technology payloads. 

The selected payloads will fly on aircraft that provide parabolic 
flight trajectories and on suborbital reusable launch vehicles capable 
of flying to altitudes above 62 miles. The flights will expose the 
payloads to reduced gravity and near-zero gravity environments. 

Please see links to Announcement of Opportunity and to the RFI at:

LOW COST PLANETARY MISSIONS CONFERENCE

The Low Cost Planetary Missions Conference series was begun in 1994 to 
further the international need for successful, low cost planetary 
missions. The 9th session of this conference is scheduled for 
June 20-24, 2011 and will be held in Laurel, Maryland, USA. 

This conference is a forum for planetary scientists, technologists, 
engineers, managers, and agency officials to collect and exchange 
information and ideas for making this class of robotic mission 
scientifically richer and yet affordably low cost.

In general, low-cost missions are the NASA equivalent of an Explorer 
or Discovery mission. The space agencies of Europe, Japan, Russia, 
India, and China have similar programs of planetary exploration within 
this cost range. These missions continue to provide significant advances 
in scientific knowledge.

Papers are sought in a range of applicable disciplines. Areas covered 
in the conference program include, but are not limited to, the 
following:

- Recent and Current Missions, Scientific Results
- Mission Planning and Operations
- Mission Management
- Technology and Engineering 
- Launch and Delivery Methods

Abstracts are due on February 1, 2011 and are limited to one page. 
The full call for papers is available at:

[NASA] MARS SCIENCE LABORATORY PARTICIPATING SCIENTIST PROGRAM
 
The MSL Participating Scientist Program is intended to enhance the 
scientific return from the MSL mission (http://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/msl/) 
by augmenting the existing MSL science team to include new 
investigations that broaden and/or complement the funded Principal 
Investigator (PI)-led investigations, thus maximizing the contribution 
of MSL to the future exploration and scientific understanding of Mars.  
The second and equally important goal of this opportunity is to 
increase the number of scientists supporting daily mission operations.
 
Notices of Intent are due January 21, 2011, and proposals are due 
March 22, 2011.
