proposals for supporting basic and applied research and technology
across a broad range of Earth and space science program elements
relevant to one or more of the following NASA Research Programs: Earth
Science, Heliophysics, Planetary Science, and Astrophysics.

Further information about specific program elements may be obtained
from the individual Program Officers listed in the Summary of Key
Information for each program element in the Appendices of this ROSES
NRA, while questions concerning general ROSES NRA policies and
procedures may be directed to:

2016 EXOMARS TRACE GAS ORBITER AO HAS BEEN RELEASED

The Announcement of Opportunity for payload experiments on the ExoMars
2016 Trace Gas Orbiter was released on 15 Jan. It can be found on 
NASA's NSPIRES site:

http://nspires.nasaprs.com/

as Amendment 4 of Stand Alone Missions of Opportunity Notice (SALMON),
Solicitation NNH08ZDA009O (under 'Open Solicitations').

See also:

http://salmon.larc.nasa.gov/SALMONreflib.html#ExoMars

and ESA's Exploration web page: 

http://exploration.esa.int/

Typical potential orbiter experiments are:

* Solar Fourier Transform IR Spectrometer: Broad survey of trace gases
  with high precision

* Solar-Nadir IR Mapper: Detection and mapping of specific trace gases

* Sub-mm Spectrometer profiler/mapper Atmospheric temperature & winds 
  plus H2O and specific trace gases

* Thermal IR profiler/mapper spectrometer or radiometer for atmospheric
  temperature and dust, plus H2O and some trace gases

* Wide Angle Camera imaging atmospheric phenomena for discriminating 
  between surface, dust clouds, & ice clouds

* High Resolution Color Stereo Camera: Surface imaging

Please contact international colleagues to discuss useful scientific 
collaborations.  We hope to receive some excellent instrument proposals
for this first ESA-NASA collaborative mission.

CALL FOR ABSTRACTS

we would like to inform you of the session F3.6 "Life inside 
refrigerators - satellites of giant planets"  of the 38th COSPAR 
Scientific Assembly, Bremen, Germany, 18-25 July 2010.

This session is about a class of possible extraterrestrial 
ecosystems - internal water oceans on icy satellites of Giant planets.
Data from recent space missions have added strong supports for the 
idea that there are liquid water oceans on several moons of the outer
planets of our Solar system - Jupiter, Saturn and satellite systems 
of extra-solar giant planets. 

For the understanding of different aspects of such possible ecosystems 
it is necessary to evaluate different key questions, namely: 
theoretical model of internal structure of icy satellites, chemical 
and physical conditions inside water layer, theoretical and laboratory
results on organic synthesis in conditions of icy moon (especially 
temperature and pressure), to discuss different exobiological niches 
on these bodies and possible Earth analogues.

It will be very useful to discuss upcoming missions to either Europa 
or Titan, their tasks, especially from astrobiology point of view.

Submission of abstracts is now underway:  

http://www.cospar-assembly.org/

Abstract deadline:  Friday, February 19, 2010 at 23:59 UTC.

NASA'S PLANETARY GEOLOGY AND GEOPHYSICS UNDERGRADUATE RESEARCH PROGRAM

URL: http://www.acsu.buffalo.edu/~tgregg/pggurp.html

We pair qualified undergraduates with NASA-funded investigators at
research locations around the country for 8 weeks during the summer.
Students will spend the summer at the NASA scientist's home 
institution. We'll pay for housing, travel, and a cost-of-living
stipend. Applications are due Feburary 12, 2010, and consist of:

- Online application form 
- 2 academic letters of reference
- Official transcripts from all undergraduate institutions

Please encourage qualified undergraduates to apply.

If you're interested in hosting an intern, please send an email by
February 15, 2010, to Tracy Gregg (tgregg@buffalo.edu), describing 
the project you have planned for the intern, and any specific skills
(e.g., ArcGIS fluency, programming in Fortran) the intern should have.
