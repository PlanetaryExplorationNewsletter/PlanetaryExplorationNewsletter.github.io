NEW-HORIZONS WORKSHOP ON ICY SURFACE PROCESSES

Date/Location: August 30 - 31, 2011, Lowell Observatory, Flagstaff, 
Arizona.
 
The principal objective of this workshop is to review the state of 
knowledge and present new ideas pertaining to the geological and 
geochemical processes that operate on the surfaces of icy worlds, with 
the goal of aiding our understanding of the Pluto system during the 
first reconnaissance in 2015 by NASA's New Horizons mission.  In 
recognition of the Lowell Observatory's key role in the discovery of 
the Pluto System, Lowell is hosting the workshop on the old Observatory 
grounds. Co-sponsored by SwRI and NASA ARC.

The workshop will focus on Solar System solid body icy surfaces 
(anywhere in the Solar System) and the physical and geological 
processes that shape icy landforms and mobilize surface materials. 
Subjects covered include possible analogs for surfaces of Pluto system, 
compositional considerations, the physical properties of surface 
materials, landscape and volatile origin and evolution, the 
implications for other KBOs, and the plans and expected datasets 
resulting from Pluto system investigations by the NH's mission. There 
will be invited and contributed talks, details to follow.

Participation is open to anyone, limited to ~75 researchers.

[NASA] Planetary Protection Policies and Practices

NASA's Planetary Protection Office has developed a course on planetary 
protection policies and practices to familiarize current and future 
practitioners with NASA and COSPAR planetary protection programs. It 
provides a comprehensive review of all applicable policies, practices 
and procedures necessary to implement a successful planetary protection 
program, emphasizing integration of managerial, administrative, and 
laboratory activities. The course is supported by the NASA Planetary 
Protection Office and the NASA Astrobiology Institute.

This course is designed for managers, engineers, designers, lab 
technicians and others interested in learning about the theory behind 
and application of planetary protection principles. Participants learn 
how the work of personnel with diverse skills and responsibilities is 
coordinated to implement successful planetary protection programs. The 
course also provides hands-on training in microbial sampling and data 
management. It is taught by experts in the field with years of practical 
experience in all aspects of planetary protection.

Course: Planetary Protection: Policies and Practices
Location: Space Life Sciences Laboratory, KSC Kennedy Space Center, 
FL 32899
Course Dates: December 7-9, 2010 
Registration Deadline: Nov. 19, 2010
Limit: 20 students

PLANETARY DECADAL REPORT DRAFT COMPLETED

A complete draft of the planetary science decadal survey report was 
assembled in late-September/early-October and sent to 18 reviewers for 
comment on October 15.  Reviewer comments are due by mid-November.  
The schedule for revising and completing the report is designed to 
enable delivery to NASA and NSF in mid- to late-February of next year.  
Public release is currently scheduled to take place at the 42nd Lunar 
and Planetary Science Conference.

PLANETARY DECADAL SURVEY'S PANELS DISSOLVED

The five topical panels supporting the planetary science decadal 
survey's steering group were dissolved on 31 October.  The panels
- Inner Planets, Mars, Giant Planets, Satellites of the Giant Planets
and Primitive Bodies - played a vital role in the drafting of the
decadal survey and in identifying priority mission activities.

Survey chair Steve Squyres wrote: "Our philosophy from the outset was 
that the panels were where the real expertise lay, so we would delegate 
as much decision-making authority to the panels as possible. All five 
panels stepped up to this challenge, did what needed to be done, and 
made the decisions that had to be made. What that meant was that by the 
time things got to the steering group, a huge fraction of the really 
hard work had already been accomplished. It made our job easy. I'm 
incredibly proud of the report that we have produced, and very excited 
about the program of planetary exploration we are going to recommend.
The reason that this program is so good, more than anything else, is 
the superb work done by the panels. The entire community of planetary 
scientists in this country is in your debt."
