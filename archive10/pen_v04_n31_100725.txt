3RD SMALL BODIES ASSESSMENT GROUP MEETING - REMOTE PARTICIPATION

You are invited to participate in the 3rd SBAG meeting via Webex.
Directions for using Webex for this meeting will be posted at:

http://www.lpi.usra.edu/sbag/meetings/aug2010/webEx.shtml

Late registration is available for this meeting at which we will be
discussing and working on the Roadmap for Small Bodies Exploration 
hearing the latest results from the Hayabusa NEO sample return 
mission, the Rosetta flyby of Lutetia, results from WISE, and more.
Go to: 

http://www.lpi.usra.edu/sbag/meetings/

Please ignore the statement on the registration page that registration
for this event is closed. The "waitlist" is being replaced by Late
Registration. So, go ahead and fill it out.

Thank you,

DIRECTOR, DEPARTMENT OF TERRESTRIAL MAGNETISM, CARNEGIE INSTITUTION FOR
SCIENCE

The Carnegie Institution for Science seeks a Director for the 
Department of Terrestrial Magnetism to lead the department in a 
multidisciplinary program of basic research in Earth and planetary 
science.  Applicants should have a record of excellence in research on 
scientific problems in this area.  The successful candidate will be 
expected to carry out an active scientific program and provide general 
scientific leadership for the staff, which currently includes groups in 
geochemistry and cosmochemistry, planetary and stellar astronomy, and 
geophysics and planetary physics.

The Carnegie Institution is an Equal Opportunity Employer and encourages 
applications from women and minorities.  Potential candidates should 
send a CV and letter of interest to search@carnegiescience.edu.  If you 
have questions or would like further information, please contact the 
chair of the search committee, Dr. Mary Lou Zoback, at 
MaryLou.Zoback@rms.com

[NASA] PLANETARY PROTECTION RESEARCH DEADLINE REMINDER            

The deadline for proposals submitted in response to the Planetary 
Protection Research Program solicitation is on September 3, 2010.  
Of particular interest is research in the following areas:

- Studies on the potential and dynamics of organism survival and 
reproduction in conditions present on the surface or subsurface of 
Mars (e.g., gullies and ice-rich environments, potentially in the 
presence of a heat source brought from Earth), or on Europa and other 
icy satellites - potentially in the presence of a heat source brought 
from Earth.

- Model planetary environmental conditions and transport processes that 
could permit mobilization of spacecraft-associated contaminants to 
locations in which Earth organisms might thrive.

- Methods capable of identifying microbes that could survive spacecraft 
flight or planetary environmental conditions (e.g., anaerobes).

- Develop or adapt methods, procedures, and conditions for spacecraft 
sterilization that are compatible with modern spacecraft materials and 
assemblies.

Proposals are sought for new projects in planetary protection that are 
specifically not within the scope of the "Astrobiology: Exobiology and 
Evolutionary Biology" Program sections of ROSES.  

Questions concerning the Planetary Protection Program may be addressed 
to Dr. Catharine A. Conley; (202) 358-3912; Cassie.Conley@nasa.gov
