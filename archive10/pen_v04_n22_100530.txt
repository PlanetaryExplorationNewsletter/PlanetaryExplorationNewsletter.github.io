DISCOVERY 2010 ANNOUNCEMENT OF OPPORTUNITY (NNH10ZDA007O)

Release Date:  June 7, 2010
NOI Due:  August 3, 2010
Proposals Due:  September 3, 2010

The NASA Science Mission Directorate (SMD) is releasing a NASA 
Announcement of Opportunity (NNH10ZDA007O), Discovery 2010.  
NASA expects to select up to three Discovery mission proposals 
for a 9 month Phase A study.  Following evaluation of Phase A 
reports, NASA expects to approve one Discovery mission to proceed 
into Phase B and subsequent mission phases. Launch Readiness Date (LRD)
is to occur no later than December 31, 2017. The proposed missions 
may target any body in the Solar System, including Mars and Earth's 
Moon, but excluding the Earth and Sun.

Participation is open to all organizations (U.S. and 
non-U.S), including educational institutions, industry, not-for-profit
organizations, Federally Funded Research and Development Centers 
(FFRDCs), NASA Centers, the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), and 
other Government agencies. Upon the release date, the full text of
the AO and all appendices will be available at:

http://nspires.nasaprs.com/  

A pre-proposal conference will be held late June or early July, 
in the Washington, DC, area:

PLANETARY SCIENCE TECHNOLOGY REVIEW (PSTR) PANEL 

A "Planetary Science Technology Review" (PSTR) panel has been 
chartered  by the Planetary Science Division (PSD) at NASA 
headquarters. The panel's primary purpose is to assist the PSD in 
developing a coordinated/integrated technology development plan that 
will better  utilize technology resources. To accomplish this, the 
panel is reviewing current technology development activities and will 
be suggesting process and policy changes to address any weaknesses. 
The panel will rely on the Planetary Science Decadal Survey to 
identify what technologies will need to be invested in and will use 
the decadal report as input and provide recommendations on how to 
implement the identified technology needs.    

A critical goal of the panel is to communicate to the science and 
technology communities the existence and status of the PSTR activities 
and to solicit input throughout the task. Along these lines the PSTR 
panel is soliciting community input on the challenges faced by 
technology development efforts and, more importantly, the panel is 
seeking sound and innovative solutions to those challenges.

More information on the panel, including methods for providing inputs
and questions, can be found at:

Thank you for your input.

JOB ANNOUNCEMENT:
PROFESSORIAL FACULTY POSITION AT THE UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND

The Astronomy Department of the University of Maryland at College Park
seeks highly qualified candidates for a tenured professorial faculty
position in observational/experimental planetary science.  Strong
preference will be given to candidates with interest and experience in
playing a leading role in spacecraft missions, although exceptional
applicants with experience in related areas of planetary science will
also be considered.

The successful candidate will have a strong international reputation
as a leader in planetary science and an established, vigorous,
externally funded research program. Demonstrated leadership skills are
necessary, as the successful candidate will play a senior role in a
strong planetary science group.

POSTDOCTORAL POSITION IN PLANETARY GEOMORPHOLOGY

Applications are invited for a postdoctoral research associate in 
modeling of planetary landscapes in the Department of Environmental 
Sciences at the University of Virginia.  We seek applicants with an 
interest in analyzing and modeling the evolution of planetary 
landscapes on Mars, Titan, and the icy outer planet satellites.  
Research topics that may be investigated include simulation modeling 
of fluvial landform evolution on Mars and Titan, hydrology and 
climatology of early Mars, and evolution of outer planet icy satellite 
surfaces by volatile sublimation, condensation, and mass wasting. 
Field studies of terrestrial analogs of planetary surfaces may also 
be involved.  Applicants must be proficient in quantitative analysis 
of geomorphic processes and must have experience with simulation
model programming in one or more computer languages.  A PhD in 
geology, environmental science, engineering, physics, planetary 
science or a related field is required at the time of appointment. 
A one year appointment is available, with the possibility of extension 
to a second and third year. The position is immediately available 
and will remain open until filled. To apply, please send a CV and 
letter of interest, along with contact information for two references,
