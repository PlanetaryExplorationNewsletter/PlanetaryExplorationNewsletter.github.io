ABGRADCON 2010 - EUROPE AWAITS

AbGradCon is the foremost astrobiology meeting for early-career 
biologists, geologists, astronomers and students from related fields 
with an interest in the origin and evolution of life in the Universe. 
In 2010 it will be held in Europe for the first time in its history 
(June 14-18). Graduate students and early-career postdocs from all 
over the world are invited to come together in Taellberg, Sweden, 
to present their research in a comfortable environment, to learn of 
the latest developments in astrobiology, to network and to forge new
collaborations. The meeting will comprise oral and poster 
presentations, half-dayworkshops and a one-day field trip to 
geologically instructive sites in the the astrobiologically interesting 
Siljan impact crater. Attendees are encouraged from the very wide range 
of subjects pertinent to astrobiology. Travel and accommodation will be 
covered for all speakers and for most poster presenters. For more 
information visit

[NASA] LETTER FROM SARA (ROSES 2010)

NASA's Research Opportunities in Space and Earth Sciences (ROSES 2010) 
was released on Feb 12th. Some differences from last year's version 
are described on the SARA (SERVICE AND ADVICE FOR RESEARCH AND 
ANALYSIS) FAQ page.
 
The first proposal due dates are not until Friday April 30, 2010 
(proposals for Cassini Data Analysis, Cryospheric Science, and Earth 
System Data Records Uncertainty Analysis are all due on that first 
day).  Until then ROSES 2009 is still in effect (there are seven due 
dates in March) and it remains a living document: Amendment 33 was 
made just in the past week. You can now easily keep track of all 
changes on the ROSES 2009 clarifications, corrections and amendments 
page, which also has an RSS feed.
 
As always, many updates have been made to the SARA web page, including 
the list of program officers and the latest grant statistics. Not only 
can you find all of the ongoing ROSES 2009 selections and archived 
selections from ROSES 2008 and 2007 on html pages, the statistics are 
combined in the "Grant Stats" files downloadable in either PDF or xl 
format. All of this can be found at the SARA grant statistics page at

FIRST ANNOUNCEMENT:  DUSTY VISIONS 2010

A workshop on Dust Spectroscopy and Dust Astronomy will be held from 
July 14-16, 2010 in Goettingen, Germany.

In a workshop style we want to discuss the present state and new 
venues in cosmic dust research.  Major topics of the workshop will 
include interstellar dust, circumplanetary dust including dusty rings 
and space debris, presolar and cometary dust, dust in interplanetary 
space including Kuiper belt dust, dusty plasmas, dust in extrasolar 
dust rings, lunar dust, as well as laboratory measurements, 
instrumentation and space missions. In situ and observational results, 
theoretical models, and the outcome of laboratory experiments will be 
discussed and their implications for future space missions will be 
highlighted. Of special emphasis is cosmochemistry and compositional 
analysis of dust, also in view of upcoming lunar and other space 
missions presently under study (e.g. EJSM, LEO, LADEE).

http://www.uni-goettingen.de/en/96209.html

Goettingen is a two-hours train ride from Bremen where the COSPAR
Scientific Assembly takes place from 18 to 25 July 2010, the week
after the Dusty Visions workshop.

Please indicate, as soon as possible, your interest to participate 
by email to dv2010@mpi-hd.mpg.de. 

Deadline for abstract submission is 15 May 2010.

OUTER PLANETS COLLOQUIUM SERIES

Would your institution like a visit and colloquium presentation from an 
expert in outer solar system science, at no expense to you?  Would you 
like travel support to share your outer solar system research?  
Presenters and host institutions are sought for the Outer Planets 
Colloquium Series, a program that matches planetary scientists with 
university campuses and research institutions.  

Participation is open to two- and four-year undergraduate colleges, 
and to research institutions throughout the United States. Host 
institutions commit to making the necessary local arrangements. 
Presenters are encouraged to address the needs of the next generation 
of scientists (graduate students, interns, and undergraduates) and to 
give an additional presentation that is free and open to the general 
public. Other interactions that increase awareness of outer solar 
system science may also be considered as part of the visit. These may 
include guest teaching a class, interacting informally with students 
and faculty, visiting local precollege campuses, or other outreach 
activities.

A range of topics is anticipated on the basis of speaker participation.

The Colloquium Series will cover the presenter's travel expenses.  
There will be no honorarium for the speaker.

Application details and further information may be found at:
