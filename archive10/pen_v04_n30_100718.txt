CPS 7TH INTERNATIONAL SCHOOL OF PLANETARY SCIENCES

The objective of CPS International School of Planetary Sciences is to 
promote education and research in planetary sciences for graduate 
students and young researchers worldwide. It will offer them an 
opportunity to interact with leading scientists in a specific field of 
the year.  Internationally well-established experts in various fields 
will review recent progress in our understandings of those fields.

The topic of this coming school is Theory of Stellar Evolution and 
Its Applications - from the First Stars to Planet-Hosting Stars and Gas 
Giant Planets.

When: 10 - 15 January 2011
Where: Seapal Suma, a casual seaside resort located in the west part of 
Kobe, Japan

[NASA] DISCOVERY 2010:  CLARIFICATION OF TWO AO REQUIREMENTS

NASA Announcement of Opportunity (AO) NNH10ZDA007O, "Discovery 2010" 
has been amended to clarify two AO requirements and the delivery date 
of Advanced Stirling Radioisotope Generators (ASRGs).

Requirement 89 has been amended to require, if applicable, that 
proposals describe how the proposed use of NEXT, AMBR, or aerocapture 
meets the minimum demonstration guidelines for the chosen technology.

Section 5.9.3, Infusion of NASA-developed technology, has been 
amended to revise the date for availability of ASRG units.

Requirement B-9 has been amended to reflect the Discovery-specific 
information that is required for the Electronic Cover Page in NSPIRES.

This NASA Announcement of Opportunity will be posted on the 
NASA research opportunity homepage at:

http://nspires.nasaprs.com/ 
(select "Solicitations" then "Open Solicitations" then "NNH10ZDA007O").

PHD POSITION ON MARTIAN CHANNEL FORMATION:  ULRECHT UNIVERSITY, 
THE NETHERLANDS

The Faculty of Geosciences, Utrecht University, The Netherlands,
offers a PhD position (Channel and box-canyon formation by rain or
groundwater outflow as past climate indicators on planet Mars) in a
vibrant group as part of the department of Physical Geography in
cooperation with the German Aerospace Center (DLR) in Berlin and the
Total Environment Simulator at Hull University (UK).

The candidate is expected to process remote sensing data of Mars and
Earth, conduct small-scale and large-scale morphodynamic experiments
in the laboratory, adapt a coupled surface runoff and groundwater
model, publish in international peer-reviewed journals, write a
(paper) PhD thesis within the project duration of four years and
assist with some teaching. Fieldwork is not included.

Highly motivated candidates with an MSc degree in applied physics,
physical geography, hydrology, civil engineering, planetary geology
or a related field are encouraged to apply. The candidate is offered
a fixed-term four-year appointment as PhD researcher with one year
probation. The gross monthly salary increases from 2,042 EU in
year 1 to 2,612 EU in year 4. For additional information, see:

MESSENGER POSTDOCTORAL RESEARCHER

The Department of Geological Sciences (http://geology.case.edu) at 
Case Western Reserve University is seeking applications for a 
postdoctoral researcher to work on data collected by the MESSENGER 
mission to Mercury.  Individuals with interest in working on a 
planetary spacecraft mission and with geophysics and/or tectonics 
expertise are encouraged to apply.  Candidates interested in tectonics 
and lithospheric structure, planetary interior structure, mantle 
convection or core dynamics, particularly those with experience working 
with gravity, topography, imaging or magnetic field data sets will be 
given preference.  The Department and the University maintain 
high-performance computing facilities that will be available for 
postdoctoral modeling and data analysis investigations.  Applications 
will be considered starting July 26, 2010 and will be accepted until 
the position is filled.  The position requires a Ph.D. at the time of 
appointment and is available for one year with the possibility of 
renewal for another year.  Interested candidates should send a cover 
letter detailing research interests and experience, curriculum vitae, 
and the names and contact information for three references to:

[NASA] CAN RELEASED FOR NASA ASTROBIOLOGY INSTITUTE MINORITY 
INSTITUTION RESEARCH SUPPORT PROGRAM

On July 9, 2010, the NASA Ames Research Center released a Cooperative 
Agreement Notice (CAN) for the NASA Astrobiology Institute (NAI) 
Minority Institution Research Support (MIRS) Program:

http://nspires.nasaprs.com/

The NAI MIRS Program is intended to help train a new generation of 
researchers in astrobiology and to increase diversity within the 
astrobiology community. This solicitation seeks proposals to continue 
recruiting and retaining underrepresented groups in science, 
technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) careers by involving 
faculty and students from Minority Serving Institutions (MSIs) in 
astrobiology research.

NASA Ames is soliciting proposals from accredited US institutions of 
higher education, non-profit higher education professional 
organizations, and consortia of those types of organizations and 
institutions. Proposals from MSIs and non-profit organizations serving
underrepresented students are strongly encouraged. Other organizations, 
including for-profit organizations, with a demonstrable capability to 
engage minority populations are also eligible to propose.

The period of performance for the award is a maximum of four years. 
NASA expects to award one Cooperative Agreement to take effect on 
February 1, 2011. The estimated total value of the award is projected 
to be $0.8M - $1.0M.

UPDATE: 3RD SMALL BODIES ASSESSMENT GROUP MEETING

Date: August 3-4, 2010
Location: Pasadena, CA
Site: Westin Hotel Pasadena

This will be an exciting meeting, discussing preparations for a future
human mission to an asteroid, as well as laying out the Roadmap for
Small Bodies Exploration in the Solar System. We will also be hearing 
the latest about possible NEO samples returned by the Hayabusa mission, 
the Rosetta flyby of Lutetia, and the flood of asteroid and comet data 
being returned from the WISE mission.

Due to transfer of NASA Research and Education Support Services to a 
new office, the registration site for this meeting is currently DOWN 
and is expected to be up next Tuesday, July 20. Please check:
