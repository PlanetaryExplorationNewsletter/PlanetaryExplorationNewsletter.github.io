[NASA PDS] MARS RECONNAISSANCE ORBITER DATA RELEASE 14

The Planetary Data System (PDS) is pleased to announce a new delivery 
of Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO) data for the following 
instruments:

MARCI
MCS
RSS
SHARAD
SPICE

In general, MRO Release 14 includes data collected between November 9, 
2009 and  February 8, 2010.  The HiRISE release includes data acquired 
between May 6 and July 31, 2010 (MRO Orbits 17,700 - 18,799).

[NASA] POSTDOCTORAL FELLOW AT NASA JOHNSON SPACE CENTER

We seek a postdoctoral fellow to do geophysical modeling of the thermal 
history of crusts of differentiated asteroids, and the transport of 
magmas through the crusts.  Geophysical models for the formation of the 
earliest crust on 4 Vesta will be constructed to further understand the 
nature of the solid substrate that hosted diogenite and cumulate 
eucrite intrusions, and extrusive basaltic eucrite flows.  One goal of 
this project is to develop better physical models for the thermal 
boundary layer on Vesta and its evolution as the asteroid 
differentiated.  This work is being done at NASA/Johnson Space Center 
in support of NASA's Dawn mission.

The postdoctoral position is through the NASA Postdoctoral Program, 
administered by Oak Ridge Associated Universities.  Information on the 
program is at: 

http://nasa.orau.org/postdoc/  

Information on this project is at: 

http://www2.orau.gov/NASA_Catalog/Opportunity/18558  

The deadline for applications is 1 November 2010, with a desired start 
date of 1 June 2011.  Interested scientists should first contact the 
project well in advance of the deadline.

COSMOCHEMISTRY ILLUSTRATED: SLIDES FOR THE CLASSROOM
 
We are creating a website containing short PowerPoint presentations in 
cosmochemistry. We hope to enhance the cosmochemical expertise of 
students studying planetary geology and geophysics, and astronomy and 
astrophysics. The sets will also be useful to planetary scientists when 
they give public presentations and courses for non-science majors. Each 
slide includes thorough explanations in the notes pages and an 
appropriate reference. Please try out the presentations. Comments 
welcomed, as are contributed presentations, gjtaylor@higp.hawaii.edu

POSTDOCTORAL RESEARCH POSITION - UI URBANA CHAMPAIGN

The Department of Geology at the University of Illinois at Urbana 
Champaign seeks a postdoctoral researcher to develop and extend 
computational modeling of volcanic eruptions into a vacuum on Io, with 
extensions to volcanism on the earth and other planets. The researcher 
will use and extend an existing continuum fluid dynamics code, and will 
play a key role in interfacing the output of this code into a rarified 
gas dynamics code.  A Ph.D. in a related field and experience with 
numerical modeling are required. Expertise in high-speed supersonic 
flows will be valued.  We will begin reviewing applications on October 
4, 2010, and anticipate a start date ASAP.  The position is for one year 
and is renewable, contingent on funding and performance.  Please send 
curriculum vitae, statement of research interests, and the names of 
three professional references to: Susan W. Kieffer, at 
skieffer@illinois.edu.  UIUC is an Affirmative Action/Equal Opportunity 
Employer and Educator.
