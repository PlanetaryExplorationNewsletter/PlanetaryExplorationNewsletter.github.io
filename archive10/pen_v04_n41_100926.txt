51 WOMEN IN PLANETARY SCIENCE

The "51 Women in Planetary Science" project is halfway to its goal of 
featuring 51 women working on NASA missions, publishing in the 
journals, and serving their community on NASA and NRC panels. In the 
interviews published on a public web site, each scientist discusses her 
unique career path and interests and reflects on advice for students or 
postdoctoral fellows interested in a career in planetary science.  This 
project is part of the Women in Planetary Science e-mentoring 
initiative, created to bring woman scientist role models to students 
and early career scientists who may never have worked with a woman in 
the field, but who aspire to one day work for NASA or on missions to 
study the planets, the stars, and the incredible phenomena in our 
solar system.  The interviews are published on a web site open to all, 
and everyone - male or female - is welcome to participate in this 
respectful atmosphere that celebrates our passions, our differences, 
and our commitment to furthering the understanding of our solar system 
and other planetary systems. Visit
