<b>EDITORIAL: CONGRESS NEEDS TO INTERVENE IN THE MANAGEMENT OF NASA 
PLANETARY SCIENCE</b>
<br><br>
New Horizons, a billion dollar highly successful asset in the Kuiper
Belt, is continuing to do unique planetary science while its team is
stretching to find another distant flyby target that could change our
ideas about solar system formation. NASA wants to shut down these
challenging planetary investigations and disband the team in order to
save less than pennies on the dollar (not a recommendation of the
Senior Review). 
<br><br>
This is only one of a rapidly growing number of managerial missteps 
by the Biden administration in NASA's planetary program. This program 
is suffering cost overruns and schedule slips in initiatives and 
missions such as Mars Sample Return and Psyche, while covering its 
near term budget needs by cutting funding to and delaying (a "soft 
cancellation"?) projects that are on-schedule and on-budget such as 
the VERITAS mission to Venus and NEO Surveyor to find actual asteroid 
threats. Delays increase costs, compounding problems in the future. 
In addition, science funding for ongoing missions at Mars is being 
significantly reduced, again against the recommendations of the Senior 
Reviews for those missions. Rather than asking Congress for the funds 
it needs to run these projects effectively and efficiently, the Biden 
administration is engaging in a form of cannibalism in an effort to 
hide its mismanagement. 
<br><br>
Congress needs to investigate these actions and provide the funding 
and direction this administration needs so the public can get the 
science return on their tax dollar investments in these missions 
instead of chaos. Congress needs to decide whether NASA is a science 
agency or a performing arts agency. NASA does not consider itself to 
be a science agency, and this may be part of the problem.
