LEADERS LETTER CONCERNING NEW HORIZONS
The following statement by the undersigned concerns the extended New
Horizons mission:
We the undersigned leaders view with alarm NASA's announced intention
to prematurely end the exploration of the solar system's Kuiper Belt
by New Horizons well before the spacecraft leaves the Kuiper Belt. We
also view with alarm NASA's intention to replace the New Horizons
science team with a new team.
New Horizons was built, launched, and paid for, at a cost of almost
$1B to the taxpayer, specifically to explore Pluto and the ancient
bodies of the Sun's Kuiper Belt. After a decade-long journey following
launch, it reached this distant, scientific wonderland in 2015, and
will remain there until 2028. Prematurely truncating the spacecraft's
exploration there, when it is still in the Kuiper Belt, is both a
fiscal and scientific waste, and sets a bad precedent for NASA.
The New Horizons team, particularly its science team and science
leadership team, have done a magnificent job at every stage of this
important and impressive project, and they continue to do so. Recent
discussions at NASA surrounding replacing this team, in part or in
whole, are both misguided and unfair, and would set a bad precedent
for NASA.
As the first and only planned spacecraft exploration of the Kuiper
Belt, New Horizons is a jewel in the Nation's and NASA's portfolio of
space leadership. We the undersigned ask NASA, the Administration, and
Congress to reverse course on both of these important matters.
