[NASA] PDS MRO DATA RELEASE 9

The NASA Planetary Data System (PDS) is pleased to announce Release 9 
of Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO) data for the following 
instruments:

CRISM, CTX, HiRISE, MARCI, MCS, RSS, SHARAD and SPICE.  In general, 
MRO Release 9 includes data collected August 9, 2008 through 
November 8, 2008.

The HiRISE Operations Center has released HiRISE image data acquired
over the time period spanning January 16, 2009 to April 4, 2009 in 
the MRO orbit range of 11,600 to 12,599.  This release contains 1.7 
Terabytes of image products derived from 604 observations made by the 
HiRISE camera during this period.

To access the above data, please visit the following link:

POSTDOCTORAL RESEARCH ASSISTANT WITHIN ATMOSPHERIC, OCEANIC AND 
PLANETARY PHYSICS, OXFORD UNIVERSITY, UK

There is a new job advert posted. Please visit 
http://www.physics.ox.ac.uk/jobs/ to view this.

Reference Number: DC09/004

Job Description: Applications are invited for a Postdoctoral Research
Assistant position in the Planetary Atmospheres Data Analysis Group
within the sub-Department of Atmospheric, Oceanic & Planetary Physics.
The successful applicant will assist in the observations of outer  
planet atmospheres from Cassini/CIRS and ground-based telescopes and  
interpret these data with sophisticated radiative transfer and 
retrieval models.

The post is available for two years in the first instance.

Anyone who thinks they may be interested in the job is encouraged to
talk to Dr Pat Irwin (or email: irwin@atm.ox.ac.uk) about it.

[NASA] RFI - FEASIBILITY OF USING CONSTELLATION ARCHITECTURE FOR 
SERVICING EXISTING AND FUTURE OBSERVATORY-CLASS SCIENTIFIC SPACECRAFT

Solicitation Number:  NNH09ZDA010L 
Release Date:   June 10, 2009 
Response Date:  August 10, 2009 
Classification Code:  A -- Research and Development 
 
NASA is soliciting information through this Request for Information 
(RFI) to improve its understanding of using the capabilities of its 
Constellation System, adaptations of the Constellation System 
architectures, and/or robotic technologies to service a wide range of 
notional science observatory-class spacecraft. The NASA-defined 
notional missions studied will be consistent with NASA's current 
portfolio of future space science missions and/or conceptual mission 
ideas that were presented to the National Research Council's (NRC's) 
Committee on Science Opportunities Enabled by NASA's Constellation 
System during the spring of 2008. These notional missions include 
observatories designed to operate in Low-Earth Orbit (LEO), at 
Geosynchronous Earth Orbit (GEO), and at Earth-Sun Lagrangian points L1 
and L2. 
 
NASA is broadly seeking information concerning technologies, 
architectures, and servicing concepts (i.e., what elements of the 
mission are worth considering for serviceability, how, and why?) 
relevant to on-orbit servicing of observatory-class spacecraft.

ESTEC POSITION AVAILABLE: HEAD OF SOLAR SYSTEMS MISSION DIVISION

Dear colleagues,

I'd like to bring to your attention the linked ESA vacancy for the 
position of Head of the Solar Systems Mission Division at ESTEC in the 
Netherlands and I'd very much like to encourage interested parties to 
apply. Please note, however, the imminent deadline of Tuesday June 16, 
i.e. this week.

SOLICITING ABSTRACTS FOR PLANETARY VOLCANISM SESSION, GSA ANNUAL 
MEETING, PORTLAND, OREGON, 18-21 OCTOBER 2009 (ABSTRACTS DUE:  AUGUST 
11)

Title: Eruptive deposits as keys to understanding volcanic systems on 
planetary bodies

Description:  This session is geared towards understanding how the 
physical properties of volcanic landforms and deposits (composition, 
morphology, age, and distribution) can be used to constrain magmatic 
processes (magma generation, movement, and storage) on all planets.

Rationale:  Volcanism, a dominant process operating on planets, is 
one in a series of processes that comprise a volcanic system. These 
other processes operate inside planets and include melting (magma 
generation), ascent, and storage. Volcanic systems represent a link 
between planetary surfaces & interiors and are windows into 
understanding their interior evolution. On Earth, field studies 
enhance our understanding of Earth's interior evolution. However, the 
inability to do this on other planets inhibits complete understanding 
of extraterrestrial volcanic systems. Instead, we are confined to 
examining images and limited compositional data of extraterrestrial 
volcanic deposits. The purpose of this session is to bring together 
terrestrial and planetary volcanologists to highlight methods of 
using limited data of extraterrestrial volcanism to understand better 
these volcanic systems. Terrestrial and planetary volcanologists 
are encouraged to submit to this session.
