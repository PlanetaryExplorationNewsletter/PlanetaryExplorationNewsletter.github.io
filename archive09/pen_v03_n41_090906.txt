LUNAR DUST, PLASMA AND ATMOSPHERE: THE NEXT STEPS

A scientific workshop on "Lunar Dust, Plasma and Atmosphere: The Next 
Steps" will be held January 27–29, 2010 at the Laboratory for 
Atmospheric and Space Physics of the University of Colorado, Boulder, 
USA. Go to

http://lpa2010.colorado.edu/ 

This meeting is being organized by the Colorado Center for Lunar Dust 
and Atmospheric Studies (CCLDAS), a NASA NLSI center.  Go to

OUTER PLANETS COLLOQUIUM SERIES

Would your institution like a visit and colloquium presentation this
academic year from an expert in outer solar system science, at no 
expense to you?  Would you like travel support to share your outer 
solar system research?  Presenters and host institutions are sought for 
the Outer Planets Colloquium Series, a program that matches planetary 
scientists with university campuses and research institutions.

Participation is open to two- and four-year undergraduate colleges, 
and to research institutions throughout the United States. Host 
institutions commit to making the necessary local arrangements.
Presenters are encouraged to address the needs of the next generation
of scientists (graduate students, interns, and undergraduates) and to
give an additional presentation that is free and open to the general
public. Other interactions that increase awareness of outer solar
system science may also be considered as part of the visit. These may
include guest teaching a class, interacting informally with students
and faculty, visiting local precollege campuses, or other outreach
activities.

A range of topics is anticipated on the basis of speaker participation.

The Colloquium Series will cover the presenter's travel expenses.
There will be no honorarium for the speaker.

NEXT-GENERATION SUBORBITAL RESEARCHERS CONFERENCE  

February 18-20, 2010 
Boulder, Colorado 

A new generation of space vehicles capable of economically delivering 
payloads and researchers is coming on line beginning in 2010. These 
vehicles will revolutionize space access by providing frequent, low-
cost access to space. Fields that will potentially benefit include 
atmospheric science, solar physics, microgravity science, planetary 
science, space life science, space physics, and education and public 
outreach (EPO). 

NSRC 2010 will provide a forum to learn about the research and EPO 
capabilities of these new systems, along with their experiment and EPO 
integration processes, and to provide input on vehicle design 
requirements for science and education. 

The abstract deadline for the conference will be November 12, 2009. To 
subscribe to a mailing list to receive e-mail updates about the 
conference, please submit the Indication of Intent form by October 14, 
2009.

PLANETARY GEOMORPHOLOGY IMAGE OF THE MONTH

The September 'Image of the Month' is now available at the IAG's 
Planetary Geomorphology web page

http://www.psi.edu/pgwg/images/sep09image.html

This month's topic is "Low-latitude landscape of fire and ice on 
Mars," contributed by Mark Bishop.

[NASA] OUTER PLANETS RESEARCH PROGRAM - NEW PROPOSAL/START DATES

Outer Planets Research (OPR), solicits proposals for diverse 
scientific investigations that contribute to the understanding of the 
outer Solar System, including the giant planets, their satellites, and 
smaller solid bodies including comets, asteroids, and Kuiper Belt 
objects. The program includes both data analysis from NASA missions 
and fundamental research.

Proposals are now due December 18. 

The planning date for start of investigation has been changed to 
November 1, 2010.

In addition to the change in the due date, the text of Appendix C.7 
has been clarified to specify that proposals to provide refinement of 
mission datasets or create data products are included in the 
requirement to "…describe a complete scientific investigation organized 
in terms of unresolved scientific questions to be addressed; objectives 
of the research; lines of inquiry, methodology, and analysis; and 
conclusions."
