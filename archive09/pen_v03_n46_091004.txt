[NASA] SALMON AO:  NEW PROPOSAL DUE DATE

Notice of Intent to propose Due:  October 28, 2009
Proposals Due:  December 18, 2009

With this amendment, the NASA Announcement of Opportunity 
NNH08ZDA009O, "Stand Alone Missions of Opportunity Notice (SALMON),"
is amended to establish a new proposal due date for proposals 
submitted in response to Program Element Appendix (PEA) H3: Small 
Complete Missions of Opportunity in Astrobiology and Fundamental 
Space Biology. This PEA has been extensively modified from the 
previously released version and the new version replaces the old 
version in its entirety.

SI_3M_0_90_MERCATOR.IMG and SI_3M_0_270_MERCATOR.IMG files in the 
data/images directory.

Volume coiss_3006 is Version 2 of this volume.  This contains changes 
to the MAXIMUM_LATTITUDE and MINIUM_LATITUDE values for 
SM_1500K_0_0_MERCATOR.IMG file in the data/images directory.

These volumes can be found on the PDS Imaging Node at URL:

VENUS PRESSURE TEST CHAMBER - A POTENTIAL RESOURCE

A working Venus pressure test chamber has been recently acquired and 
is located at Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland. It will be made 
available to the Venus scientific community and others for testing of 
small flight components/instruments and short-term experiments that 
require high temperatures and pressures.  The chamber was developed by 
Dr. William Byrd at Iowa State University through the Iowa Space Grant 
Consortium.

The chamber is able to maintain a temperature of 740K and pressure of 
95.6 bar for ~48 hours under a carbon dioxide atmosphere. The 
dimensions of the chamber are five inches in diameter and twelve inches 
deep. The actual working space is expected to be slightly smaller 
because of volume taken up by monitoring sensors. The chamber is 
currently being tested and calibrated. Viewing ports and/or thoughputs 
for data and power will eventually be installed as options. Running at 
temperatures and pressures lower than those found at the surface of 
Venus are possible. Details about the Venus Pressure Test Chamber will 
be presented at the VEXAG meeting scheduled for October 28-29, 2009.

have access to all the Mauna Kea telescopes on which the University of 
Hawaii has guaranteed observing time.  

Desirable Qualifications:  Experience with infrared imaging or 
spectroscopy, testing infrared arrays, achieving optimum angular 
resolution and image quality, writing astronomical data reduction 
packages.  To view the complete job ad, visit

EDUCATION AND PUBLIC OUTREACH MANAGER, LABORATORY FOR ATMOSPHERIC AND 
SPACE PHYSICS, UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO AT BOULDER

LASP has developed a highly successful and nationally recognized EPO 
program emphasizing our research in atmospheric, planetary, solar and 
space sciences.  The successful candidate should have demonstrated 
leadership in the development and implementation of science-based 
education and public outreach activities.  Responsibilities will 
include development and implementation of EPO components for LASPâ€™s 
existing research programs, as well as future opportunities; 
establishing and sustaining collaborative programs with other EPO 
programs (both locally and nationally); coordination of EPO activities 
by LASP personnel and their collaborators at other institutions; 
training of LASP personnel participating in EPO activities; and 
securing funding for EPO program development. More details about LASP 
and our current EPO activities can be found at our web site, at

POSTDOCTORAL RESEARCHER IN PLANETARY PETROLOGY POSITION

The Lunar and Planetary Institute (LPI), a division of the 
Universities Space Research Association, invites applications for a 
postdoctoral fellowship in the petrology of planetary materials. 

The successful candidate will work with Dr. Allan Treiman in 
NASA-funded research focusing on volatiles in magmas and on aqueous 
alteration of igneous rocks; target materials include Martian 
meteorites, lunar samples, and terrestrial analogs.  These efforts 
will start with analyses by optical microscopy and electron 
microprobe; other instruments are available as needed at nearby 
Johnson Space Center (experimental petrology laboratories, LA-ICPMS), 
or can be arranged with external collaborators (e.g., SIMS).  The 
candidate will be encouraged to design and conduct her/his own research 
in planetary science, propose for external funding, participate in 
grant review panels and analysis groups, and become involved with 
spacecraft missions.

NAM 2010 will be held in Glasgow, and will incorporate both the UK 
Solar Physics (UKSP) and Magnetosphere, Ionosphere and Solar-
Terrestrial (MIST) meetings.

Slots for up to 42 parallel sessions, each of 90 minutes duration 
exist, with further sessions in the programme dedicated for poster 
viewing.  We would like to invite from the community nominations for 
parallel session themes / multiple parallel sessions for any topic or 
research area considered relevant to the NAM, UKSP and MIST meetings. 
Particularly welcomed are nominations likely to have broad cross-
community appeal. 

Please submit the following, before Oct. 30, 2009 to:

martin@astro.gla.ac.uk

1. Theme and provisional title of parallel session.
2. Brief (i.e. a few sentences) rationale for its nomination
3. A nominated session organiser (preferably an individual who has
   already agreed to undertake this role!)

It is expected that the final programme of parallel sessions will be 
drawn up before the end of 2009.

FIRST ANNOUNCEMENT:  MARS WORKSHOP

28 March - 2 April 2010
Les Houches, France

The goals of the workshop are to integrate the main results of both 
the recent Earth-based observations and the missions to Mars 
(MarsExpress, Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, Phoenix and Mars Exploration 
Rovers) into a new global picture of Mars evolution.  With the same 
spirit of the previous workshops, discussions among scientists of 
different disciplines will be encouraged and it is foreseen that they 
will help refine the scientific goals of the future missions to Mars. 
This workshop is an opportunity for the young scientists to be updated 
on the most recent results and to be trained in some specific data 
processing techniques.

Deadline for registration: 15 January 2010

PLANETARY PROTECTION POLICIES AND PRACTICES COURSE - 2 OPENINGS REMAIN

The course will be held at the Applied Physics Laboratory, 
October 20-22, 2009.  This course is designed for managers, engineers, 
designers, lab technicians, and others interested in learning about 
the theory behind and application of planetary protection principles. 

Participants learn how the work of personnel with diverse skills and 
responsibilities is coordinated to develop an effective program of 
implementing planetary protection requirements. This course provides 
hands-on laboratory training in microbial sampling and data management.  
The course is taught by experts in the field with years of practical 
experience in all aspects of planetary protection. Anyone who is 
interested in filling the spots should contact Amy Baker as soon as 
possible for quick enrollment.
