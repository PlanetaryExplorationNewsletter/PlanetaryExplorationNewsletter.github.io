EUGENE SHOEMAKER IMPACT CRATERING AWARD
 
Applications are now being accepted for the Eugene M. Shoemaker Impact
Cratering Award. The deadline for applications and supporting letters 
of reference is September 11, 2009. This award is for undergraduate or
graduate students, of any nationality, working in any country, in the
disciplines of geology, geophysics, geochemistry, astronomy, or 
biology. The award, which will include $2500.00, is to be applied for 
the study of impact craters, either on Earth or on the other solid 
bodies in the solar system, which areas of study may include but shall 
not necessarily be limited to impact cratering processes, the bodies 
(asteroidal or cometary) that make the impacts, or the geological, 
chemical or biological results of impact cratering. Details about the 
award can be found at

Interested faculty sponsors may also want to post a flyer in their
institutions, so that students are aware of the opportunity.  A flyer
can be downloaded from

This award is sponsored by the GSA Planetary Geology Division and the
student awardee will be announced at the division's October business
meeting in Portland, Oregon.

GSA SPECIAL SESSION: FAULT AND FRACTURE STUDIES IN THE SOLAR SYSTEM

Please consider submitting an abstract to the following 
Tectonics/Planetary Geology session: 

T71. Fault and Fracture Studies in the Solar System

Conveners: Simon Kattenhorn and Amanda Nahm

Abstract deadline: Aug. 11th, midnight EST.  

This session involves studies of the evolution and mechanics of 
non-terrestrial fault and fracture systems through spacecraft image 
analysis, theoretical models, or geophysical techniques.

Spacecraft missions have identified exquisite and often enigmatic 
fault and fracture patterns that tell of a long and complex tectonic 
history on many solar system bodies. These include terrestrial planets 
(Mercury, Venus, Mars), icy moons (e.g. Europa, Ganymede, Enceladus, 
Dione), and asteroids. Observations and theoretical considerations of 
terrestrial analogs aid in interpretations of tectonic deformation 
features in the solar system. We encourage submissions that illustrate 
how geometric, kinematic, and mechanical models of fault and fracture 
development, which have their basis in terrestrial studies, can be 
used to unravel the deformation histories of other solar system bodies. 
Terrestrial analog studies must show direct application to 
non-terrestrial examples. Appropriate topics include the evolution and 
mechanics of fault systems, global or regional fracture patterns on 
planets or moons, and magmatic fracturing.

FALL AGU SPECIAL SESSION: RETURN TO THE MOON - LATEST SCIENCE RESULTS

Fall AGU Session: P08
Abstract deadline 3 Sep

Conveners:
Timothy Stubbs (Univ. Maryland, Timothy.J.Stubbs@nasa.gov)
Dana Hurley, Bradley Thomson (JHU Applied Physics Lab)

The dawning of a new era of lunar exploration has served as a reminder 
that there is still much to learn from our closest celestial neighbor.
The recent international flotilla of lunar missions, including Kaguya 
(SELENE), Chandrayaan-1, Chang'e and SMART-1, have returned valuable 
new data that has provided fresh insights into the Moon. The 
discoveries will continue from these missions and upcoming NASA 
missions, LRO, LCROSS and LADEE. Together with these new observations, 
there has been significant progress with theoretical modeling of lunar 
processes, laboratory simulations and re-analyses of data from past 
missions (including many Apollo-era experiments).

This session is open to the latest lunar science results from 
theoretical modeling, laboratory simulations, and the analysis of new 
and old datasets. Particularly encouraged are presentations that 
include observations from recent missions, activities associated with 
the newly-formed NASA Lunar Science Institute, or studies that 
demonstrate how the Moon can be used as a "Rosetta Stone" for helping 
understand processes occurring at other bodies in the solar system.
