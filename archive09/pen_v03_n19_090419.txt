PLANETARY DECADAL SURVEY UPDATE

Steven Squyres, chair of the National Research Council's Planetary 
Science Decadal Survey, has posted the first of a planned series of 
community newsletters on the survey's website.  The newsletter, 
together with additional information about the survey's goals, 
organization and activities, is available at 

http://www7.nationalacademies.org/ssb/ssedecadal2011.html.

Work on assembling the decadal survey's steering group and supporting 
panels is progressing.  Candidates have now been identified to fill all 
of membership slots on the steering group and, also, the 
chair/vice-chair positions on the five panels.  The identities of these
individuals will be made public as soon as their nominations have been 
approved by the NRC's executive office.  The numerous suggestions and 
nominations made by members of the community, the analysis/assessment 
groups and other organizations were extremely useful in identifying 
these individuals.  Nominations are still being accepted for panel 
membership.  

Dates for the first two meetings of the steering group have now been 
set. The first meeting will be held at the National Academies' Keck 
Center in Washington, D.C., on 6-8 July.  The second meeting will be 
held at the National Academies' Beckman Center in Irvine, California,
on 16-18 November.

STEVE OSTRO MEMORIAL SYMPOSIUM

Dear Colleagues,

This is an invitation for you to attend a one day JPL Symposium to 
honor the memory of Steve Ostro.  This one-day Symposium will be held 
at

JPL's Von Karman Auditorium on Thursday June 4, 2009 (8:30 - 5:00). 

The ten invited oral presentations are listed below.  Attendees are 
invited to bring poster presentations (30 x 40 inches), which will be 
displayed in Von Karman Auditorium all day.  If there is sufficient 
interest, additional room for posters will be provided in a facility 
adjacent to the Auditorium.

There is no registration fee.

To facilitate access to JPL (through JPL security) and to make plans 
for the poster presntations, potential attendees are asked to contact 
either Don Yeomans (donald.k.yeomans@jpl.nasa.gov) or Lance Benner 
(Lance.Benner@jpl.nasa.gov) by May 15 with the following information:

Name
Affiliation
email address
U.S. citizen?
Will you bring a poster presentation?
If so, what is the title of your poster presentation?

Details of the Symposium and the invited speakers can be found at: 

http://echo.jpl.nasa.gov/ostro_symposium/ostro_symposium.html

With kind regards,

Don Yeomans and Lance Benner, Co-Chairs

VENUS EXPLORATION ANALYSIS GROUP (VEXAG) SEEKS INPUT

The Goals, Objectives and Investigations for Venus Exploration were 
updated at the last Venus Exploration Analysis Group (VEXAG) meeting, 
held 2/25/09. We seek further community input on this updated list and 
urge the community to review and provide input on the updated 
Goals-Objectives-Investigations chart that is posted on the VEXAG 
website at 

http://www.lpi.usra.edu/vexag/investigations_comments/

The objectives and investigations are listed in priority order. The 
comments page will be available until May 1, 2009.  We anticipate that 
the updated VEXAG White Paper will be posted on the website in early 
summer, 2009.

[NASA] CALL FOR PROPOSALS: FIELD SCIENCE ANALOG TESTING

The focus of this program will be on engaging field scientists 
(supported by the NASA Science Mission Directorate) within NASA 
Exploration Systems Mission Directorate (ESMD) field campaigns to 
provide high fidelity field testing of hardware and operations to 
optimize future human scientific exploration of the Moon and Mars.

A goal of this program is to test operations and systems for human 
lunar exploration to help optimize scientific investigations.  NASA 
is in need of data to support surface science and operations scenarios 
as it moves forward in its architecture and requirements definition 
processes for human lunar exploration.

Proposers should plan to provide feedback to the ESMD analog teams 
regarding concepts of operations and hardware (including 
instrumentation) as NASA plans for future human lunar exploration. 
Only by considering how to accomplish high-fidelity science 
investigations can these components of exploration be satisfactorily 
tested to optimally aid with the planning and implementation of 
science investigations on other planetary surfaces.

The due date for these 5 page proposals is May 11, 2009. For more 
information regarding this call for proposals go to

[NASA] LETTER FROM THE SENIOR ADVISOR FOR RESEARCH AND ANALYSIS (SARA)


A new SARA letter has been posted at 

http://sara.nasa.gov 

(click on "Letters from SARA" on the left navigation bar) 

Highlights: 
(1) All team members on ROSES 09 proposals must confirm their 
    participation online. 
(2) Warning: proposal submissions through grants.gov may not be 
    possible. 
(3) The latest on NASA spending on conferences.
