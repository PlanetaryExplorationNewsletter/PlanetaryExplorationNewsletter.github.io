NASA PLANETARY PROTECTION OFFICER IS SOUGHT

From: James L. Green, Director, Planetary Science Division, NASA HQ
 
One of the essential activities in planetary science is planetary
protection. NASA Headquarters maintains a constant need for a Planetary
Protection Officer (PPO) to manage this important agency wide function.
Although the PPO reports to the SMD Associate Administrator 
(Dr. Ed Weiler), it is organizationally part of the Planetary Science 
Division. I am delighted to announce that today (17 April) we have 
posted a Civil Servant opportunity for PPO at NASA Headquarters. 
I would like to urge all interested parties to get on this right away 
since the deadline for applications is coming up quickly. I can 
guarantee that the PPO will be part of a vibrant organization at an 
exciting time. My plans are to fill the sky with planetary missions so 
there will be plenty to do.
 
The position can be found at:

Please note that applications are due Friday May 1.
