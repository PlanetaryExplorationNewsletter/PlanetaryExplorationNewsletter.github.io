INVITATION TO THE MARS EXPLORATION ANALYSIS GROUP (MEPAG) MEETING

When: March 3-4, 2009 
Where: Holiday Inn Rosslyn Westpark, Arlington, VA.

This meeting comes at a critical juncture.  Our existing missions at 
Mars will have completed another year of exciting science and 
exploration, and two missions in development, MSL and MAVEN, are 
scheduled for launch in 2011 and 2013, respectively.  Our planning 
focus is now on the last half of the decade-the launch opportunities 
of 2016, 2018, and 2020.  It will be very important for MEPAG to 
participate in the process of updating our exploration strategies, the 
definition of the mission options, and the mission sequencing that 
leads to an architecture. Furthermore, the National Academy is starting 
the next Planetary Science Decadal Survey with crucial contributions 
from the community expected this year, and it will be important for us 
to be prepared to respond to their requests for input.
