INVITATION TO PARTICIPATE IN *COMMUNITY* WHITE PAPERS ON SMALL BODIES

This is a clarification of the previous message from the NASA Small 
Bodies Assessment Group.

The Planetary Decadal Survey ultimately must formulate a list of 
priorities for the next decade of solar system exploration. Legitimacy 
and political weight for the Survey is achieved when there is a 
community consensus on these priorities. The SBAG wishes to contribute 
to the credibility of this process by coordinating with the Primitive 
Bodies Panel of the Survey and organizing community white papers on 
subdisciplines (e.g., asteroids, comets) to be followed by open 
discussion and polling of priorities across these subdisciplines. 
Everyone interested in asteroid science, for instance, should sign up 
to participate in the asteroid science white paper so that it can 
reflect your identification of the issues, priorities, and how those 
priorities should be addressed. Please go to

The process works best when everyone participates.

Primitive bodies topics include:

Near-Earth Objects
Asteroids
Comets
Dwarf Planets
Centaurs and Small Irregular TNOs
Interplanetary Dust
Small Irregular Satellites

Thank you,

Mark V. Sykes,
Small Bodies Assessment Group
