[NASA] THREE-DAY TRAINING COURSE ON PLANETARY PROTECTION

Course: "Planetary Protection: Policies and Practices"

Dates: October 20-22, 2009

Location: Applied Physics Lab, Laurel, Maryland

We cordially invite all interested parties to participate in the
upcoming course on Planetary Protection Policies and Practices, which 
is designed to familiarize current and future practitioners with 
NASA, ESA, and COSPAR planetary protection programs.  The course
provides an overview of applicable policies, practices and procedures
necessary to implement a successful planetary protection program,
emphasizing integration of managerial, administrative, and laboratory
activities. It is supported by the NASA Planetary Protection Officer.

[NASA] DUE DATE FOR PLANETARY PROTECTION RESEARCH PROPOSALS

The Planetary Protection Research component of ROSES, element C.18, is
soliciting proposals that address aspects of planetary protection not
covered in other ROSES elements.  Of particular interest for this call
are proposals to investigate 1) the limits of life in planetary
environments; 2) modelling transport mechanisms to planetary surfaces 
or subsurfaces; 3) adaptation of sensitive molecular or biochemical
detection technologies for planetary protection purposes; and 4) novel
or improved spacecraft sterilization technologies.

The research announcement is available on the NSPIRES website for ROSES

init&solId={BA568A7F-6747-6020-5575-362448423BBA}&path=open

Proposals are due to NSPIRES on Sept. 4th, 2009.

Questions may be addressed to Dr. Catharine Conley, Planetary 
Protection Officer, NASA Science Mission Directorate,
