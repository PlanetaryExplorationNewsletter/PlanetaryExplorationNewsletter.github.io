OUTER PLANETS FLAGSHIP MISSION JOINT SUMMARY REPORTS

The public release versions of the Joint Summary Reports for the 
Europa Jupiter System Mission (EJSM) and Titan Saturn System Mission 
(TSSM) can now be downloaded from two NASA websites:

NASA Solar System Exploration website:   
http://solarsystem.nasa.gov

Outer Planet Flagship Mission website:   
http://opfm.jpl.nasa.gov/

Links to these sites from the OPAG website 

http://www.lpi.usra.edu/opag/ 

are also in the process of implementation

The two documents will also be available from ESA websites for 
convenience access of Europeans wishing to find out more about the 
next step in outer planet exploration.

The final reports of the two studies (EJSM and TSSM) will also be 
posted to those sites by the end of January.

IEEE GRSS WORKSHOP ON HYPERSPECTRAL IMAGE AND SIGNAL PROCESSING

The First IEEE GRSS Workshop on Hyperspectral Image and Signal
Processing  (evolution in remote sensing) (WHISPERS'09) will be held
in Grenoble, France in August 2009.

It is intended for every researcher working with hyperspectral data 
and spectroscopy, from physical modeling, sensor, acquisition and 
calibration, to data processing and applications.

The deadline for full 4 pages paper submission is on March 31st.

If you want to submit an invited session, please use the following
procedure:

Choose between:
- a 5 papers oral session
- a 10 papers oral session
- a 10 to 20 poster session

Submit your proposal by email to me
(jocelyn.chanussot@gipsa-lab.inpg.fr) before february 15th.

It should include:
- the title of the proposed session
- name and affiliation of one or two people submitting the session 
  (and expected to chair it during the conference if it is accepted)
- title of the papers to be included in the session, with names and
  affiliations of the authors, and a short abstract (10 to 15 lines
  per paper)

Please, check the website for the listing of the topics of interest.

Conference URL:

http://www.asiaoceania.org/aogs2009/

This session will be dedicated to the study of Astrobiology, with 
solicited, contributed, and poster presentations addressing 
(1) extraterrestrial organics and their relevance to origins of 
life (2) conditions on the early Earth that may have been necessary 
for the origin of life (3) subsequent events and conditions that may 
have contributed to the evolution of organisms and the development 
of Earth's climate (4) habitability of extraterrestrial atmospheres,
surfaces and interiors (5) detectability of biosignatures.  Examples
of relevant topics: mass extinctions, methane on Mars and Titan, and
life in subsurface oceans such as Europa's.

PLANETARY MAGNETISM SESSION AT AGU IN TORONTO

Dear colleague,

This is to invite you to participate in the upcoming 2009 AGU Joint
Assembly, which will be held in Toronto, Canada, May 24 to 27.

We invite you to participate in the Geomagnetism and Paleomagnetism
(GP) session GP-12 on "Planetary Magnetism". This session will
provide a forum for presentation and discussion of new developments
on studies of planetary magnetism and magnetic fields. We
welcome contributions coming from theory and analyzes of direct
observations, numerical simulations and experiments on planetary
magnetic fields, crater magnetic anomalies and magnetic properties
of materials.

Abstract submissions are now open at the AGU web site

http://www.agu.org/meetings/ja09/program/abstract_submissions.php

Online abstract submission deadline is March 4 2009, at 23:59 hrs
UTC.

Looking forward to see you in Toronto

Jafar Arkani-Hamed, jafar@physics.utoronto.ca

TORONTO SPRING MEETING SESSION ON "THE TAGISH LAKE METEORITE AND EARLY
SOLAR SYSTEM EVOLUTION"

We would like to draw your attention to the session GA20: "The Tagish 
Lake meteorite and Early Solar System evolution," which will be held 
at the 2009 Joint Assembly in Toronto, Canada on 24-27 May, 2009.

Conveners:
Phil McCausland   [pmccausl@uwo.ca]
Chris Herd   [herd@ualberta.ca]
Gopalan Srinivasan   [srini@geology.utoronto.ca]

The Tagish Lake meteorite is a unique carbonaceous chondrite which 
fell in northwestern British Columbia in January of 2000 and was 
collected in a pristine, frozen state, providing a new window on the
early Solar System. This session invites contributions on studies of 
primitive meteorites such as the Tagish Lake carbonaceous chondrite 
as well as primitive achondrites, IDPs and returned samples from 
STARDUST, that record the chronology of events in the early solar 
system, the chemical and isotopic heterogeneity of its presolar 
and refractory source materials and their subsequent modification 
by solar nebular and parent body processes.

Co-sponsored by AGU Planetary Sciences, MAC
