ANTARCTIC SEARCH FOR METEORITES (ANSMET) COMMENCING BLOG

The ANtarctic Search for METeorites (ANSMET) team is ready to be 
deployed to the Miller Range to carry out this year's meteorite search.  
We have been at the McMurdo Station for nearly 2 weeks, having the last 
week basically been waiting for a flight to the field. We should be 
going tomorrow morning, Tuesday (Dec 15), New Zealand time.

The weblog is in operation, and we should be able to carry out blogging 
to the community and the rest of the world once in the field. Our weblog 
is

COSMIC DUST LAB ANNOUNCEMENT

The Cosmic Dust Lab will be reopened for a limited time in the Spring 
of 2010 for sample allocation work. Requests for cosmic Dust will be 
accepted by the curator from now until March 30, 2010. Please visit

TITAN THROUGH TIME: FORMATION, EVOLUTION AND FATE

Titan Through Time will be a 2 1/2 day workshop, April 6-8, 2010, 
hosted at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland, aimed at 
bringing together the planetary research community to share recent 
topical results and to debate about Titan's formation, evolution and 
fate.

This workshop is open to everyone who has an interest in Titan, 
including those studying it experimentally through spacecraft missions 
and telescope facilities, researchers of solar system formation, 
history of Mars and Venus, comets, physical chemistry, laboratory 
spectroscopy and other fields with important intersections with Titan 
research.

The event will mix both invited reviews, as well as topical contributed 
talks and posters. 

Deadlines:
Abstracts - February 1st
Registration - February 15th (to allow time for badging.)
 
Registration is limited to 50 participants due to available conference 
facilities.

EXPLORATION FELLOWSHIP PROGRAM

The School of Earth and Space Exploration (SESE) at Arizona State 
University invites applications for the Exploration Postdoctoral 
Fellowship Program. SESE’s core mission is to integrate science and 
engineering to provide a better understanding of our world and beyond. 
Research areas within SESE encompass astrophysics, cosmology, Earth 
science, climate science, planetary science, exploration systems 
engineering, and science education. The Exploration Fellowship Program 
aims to provide opportunities for conducting research on cutting-edge 
topics and to foster interdisciplinary collaboration.

Applications must include a brief research proposal. Preference will be 
given to proposals including multiple focus areas within SESE and that 
will involve new collaborations among our faculty. Potential research 
topics span the full range of research interests of our faculty 
(http://sese.asu.edu/focus_areas), including key initiatives in the 
origin, evolution, and fate of the Universe, planetary bodies, Earth's 
surface environment, and life; and lifelong science and engineering 
education.

Evaluation of applications begins February 15, 2010; applications will 
be accepted until positions are filled. Up to 5 fellowships will be 
awarded this year. Details of the application process are available 
online:

ASU is an equal opportunity/affirmative action employer that actively 
seeks diversity among applicants and promotes a diverse workforce.
