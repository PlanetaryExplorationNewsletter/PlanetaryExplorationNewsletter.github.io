[NASA] EARTH AND SPACE SCIENCE FELLOWSHIP (NESSF) PROGRAM

NASA announces a call for graduate fellowship proposals to the NASA 
Earth and Space Science Fellowship (NESSF) program for the 2010-2011 
academic year.  This call for fellowship proposals solicits 
applications from accredited U.S. universities on behalf of individuals 
pursuing Master of Science (M.Sc.) or Doctoral (Ph.D.) degrees in Earth 
and space sciences, or related disciplines. The purpose of NESSF is to 
ensure continued training of a highly qualified workforce in 
disciplines needed to achieve NASA's scientific goals.  Awards 
resulting from the competitive selection will be made in the form of 
training grants to the respective universities.

The deadline for NEW applications is February 1, 2010, and the 
deadline for RENEWAL applications is March 15, 2010.

Go to

http://nspires.nasaprs.com/ 

click on "Solicitations", "Open Solicitations" then select 
"NESSF 10".  

The advisor has an active role in the submission of the fellowship 
proposal. To use the NSPIRES system, the advisor, the student, and 
the university must all register.

CALL FOR CANDIDATE FUTURE MARS LANDING SITES

The Mars Program Offices at NASA Headquarters and The Jet Propulsion 
Laboratory invite submission of new candidate landing sites for future 
missions. The goal is to gather information on future candidate landing 
sites and develop a list of high priority candidate landing sites for 
a range of possible future missions so that targeting by instruments on 
the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO) and Mars Odyssey (ODY) can begin 
while those orbital assets are still in operation. 

The full announcement, including proposal requirements, may be found at

http://marsoweb.nas.nasa.gov/landingsites/ 

New candidate landing sites can be submitted through the end of 2009 
and should be submitted via e-mail to both John Grant (grantj@si.edu) 
and Matt Golombek (mgolombek@jpl.nasa.gov). 

This call for candidate new landing sites is an unfunded effort.

It is anticipated that a call for proposals (RFP) to support analysis 
of new candidate landing sites will be issued by Critical Data Products 
(CDP) Program at JPL in January 2010. It is expected that CDP will fund 
approximately 5-10 proposals at 25K for one year in early 2010 with 
additional funding anticipated for additional sites in future years.

JOB ANNOUNCEMENT: POSTDOCTORAL RESEARCHER IN PLANETARY MAPPING

The Lunar and Planetary Institute (LPI), a division of the Universities 
Space Research Association invites applications for a postdoctoral 
fellowship in planetary science. The successful candidate will work 
with Dr. Paul Schenk, investigating the topography of Jupiter's 
volcanic moon Io using stereo and shape-from-shading techniques 
(although experience in these tools is not required). A variety of 
landforms will be mapped, including volcanoes and mountains, as well 
as regional and global scale shape deviations.  The candidate will also 
be expected to develop their own research projects using these data.

For further information, please visit 

http://www.lpi.usra.edu/lpi/positions.shtml 

or applicants should send a letter of interest, a curriculum vita with 
a list of publications, a brief (maximum three pages) statement of 
research interests, and a list of three references to 
resume@lpi.usra.edu by October 30, 2009. Review of candidates will

JOB ANNOUNCEMENT: PLANETARY GEOPHYSICS POSTDOCTORAL FELLOWSHIP

The Universities Space Research Association's Lunar and Planetary 
Institute (LPI) in Houston, Texas, invites applicants to apply for a 
postdoctoral fellowship in planetary geophysics. 

The successful candidate will work with Dr. Walter Kiefer on a 
NASA-funded project studying the nature of mantle convection on Mars 
and its effects on the thermal evolution and volcanic history of the 
planet. The candidate will also have the opportunity to conduct 
research in planetary geophysics of his or her own choosing.

The position requires a Ph.D. in Planetary Science or Geophysics and 
experience in computer programming and numerical modeling methods, 
particularly finite elements. Experience with parallel computing in a 
Linux environment will be an asset.  Further information on current 
research and facilities at the LPI can be found on our website at

The Lunar and Planetary Institute (LPI), a division of the Universities 
Space Research Association, invites applications for a postdoctoral 
fellowship in the petrology of planetary materials. 

The successful candidate will work with Dr. Allan Treiman in 
NASA-funded research focusing on volatiles in magmas and on aqueous 
alteration of igneous rocks; target materials include Martian 
meteorites, lunar samples, and terrestrial analogs. These efforts will

JOB ANNOUNCEMENT: POSTDOCTORAL FELLOW IN LUNAR SURFACE GEOLOGY
    
The Universities Space Research Association's Lunar and Planetary 
Institute (LPI) invites applications for a lunar science and 
exploration postdoctoral fellowship. We are seeking a motivated 
individual who wants to integrate existing lunar data (e.g., Apollo 
landing site geology, Lunar Orbiter images) with new data from the 
Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter Camera. Expertise in orbital image 
analysis and planetary geology concepts, particularly impact cratering 
processes, are desirable.  Research activities will involve the highest 
science priorities identified by the NRC's (2007) Scientific Context 
for Exploration of the Moon and will likely interface with landing site 
assessments for NASA's Constellation Program.  

The successful candidate should be able to work independently, although 
encouraged to take advantage of the tremendous lunar-related expertise 
in the Houston area.  The successful candidate will be a member of the 
new LPI-JSC Center for Lunar Science and Exploration 

http://www.lpi.usra.edu/nlsi/

which is one of the core teams within the NASA Lunar Science Institute.
