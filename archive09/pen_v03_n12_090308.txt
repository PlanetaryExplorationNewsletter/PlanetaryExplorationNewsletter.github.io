MARIO ACUNA, FRIEND AND COLLEAGUE

Dear Friends:

There's no easy way to convey sad news, so I'll do it as Mario would
have. Mario Acuna passed away last night, in the comfort of his home,
surrounded by his family and loved ones. He leaves a devoted wife,
Barbara; sons Jamie, Andrew, and Daniel; daughter Marta, and five
grandchildren, with more on the way. He passed peacefully, content 
with all that life afforded him.

Mario's struggle with multiple myeloma, a cancer of the blood, is
chronicled in a blog posted by his family:

I will pass on details of the arrangements as they are available.

HELP DESIGN A LUNAR LANDER

ESAâ€™s Directorate of Human Space Flight has released a Request for 
Information about experiments and payload elements for their first 
lunar lander. It is intended that these inputs shall be used to inform 
the early design phases of the mission, it is not however a formal 
Announcement of Opportunity. 

The mission will support human exploration activities and will have 
the following objectives, in order of priority: 

1. To advance European technological capabilities for future human 
exploration of the Moon; 
2. To characterise the lunar environment and potential in situ 
resources to identify their implications for future human exploration; 
3. To progress in the definition of tools, interfaces and operational 
techniques related to surface exploration; 
4. To increase our understanding of the formation, history and 
evolution of the Moon. 

We would be interested to learn of potential payload elements that you 
are involved with. Please pass this message on to anyone you think may 
be interested in responding to this call. 

For information on this call and for details of how to submit a 
response please go to

Planetary Geophysics Postdoctoral Fellowship

The Universities Space Research Association's Lunar and Planetary 
Institute in Houston, Texas, invites applications for a postdoctoral 
fellowship in planetary geophysics. The successful candidate will work 
with Dr. Walter Kiefer on a NASA-funded project studying the nature of 
mantle convection on Mars and its effects on the thermal evolution and 
volcanic history of the planet. The candidate will also have the 
opportunity to conduct research in planetary geophysics of his or her 
own choosing.

The position requires a Ph.D. in Planetary Science or Geophysics and 
experience in computer programming and numerical modeling methods, 
particularly finite elements. Experience with parallel computing in a 
Linux environment will be an asset. The position will be offered for 
an initial period of two years with a possible extension to a maximum 
of three years.

Applicants should send a letter of interest, a CV with list of 
relevant publications, a brief (maximum 3 pages) statement of research 
interests, and a list of three references. Applications should be sent 
to resume@lpi.usra.edu by April 15, 2009. Review of candidates will 
begin on April 15, with a hiring decision as soon as possible 
thereafter.

Additional information about LPI can be found at www.lpi.usra.edu.
