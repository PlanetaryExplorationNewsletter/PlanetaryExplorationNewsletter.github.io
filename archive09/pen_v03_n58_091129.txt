[NASA] EXPERIMENTAL PROGRAM TO STIMULATE COMPETITIVE RESEARCH (EPSCoR)

The FY 2010 Research Announcement for the NASA Experimental Program to 
Stimulate Competitive Research is released. Each funded NASA proposal 
is expected to establish research activities that will make significant 
contributions to the strategic research and technology development 
priorities of one or more of NASA's four Mission 
Directorates—Aeronautics Research, Exploration Systems, Science, and 
Space Operations—and contribute to the overall research infrastructure, 
science and technology capabilities, higher education, and economic 
development of the proposing jurisdiction. 

EPSCoR's goal is to strengthen the research capability of jurisdictions 
that have not in the past participated equably in competitive 
aerospace research activities. NSF determines overall jurisdiction 
eligibility for NASA EPSCoR. The following NASA EPSCoR jurisdictions 
may respond to this solicitation: Alabama, Alaska, Delaware, Hawaii, 
Idaho, Iowa, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Mississippi, Montana, Nevada, 
New Hampshire, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Puerto Rico, Rhode Island, 
South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Utah, West Virginia, and 
Wyoming. The following jurisdictions have each won a total of three 
awards in the last two competitions (2008 and 2009) and may not 
respond to this solicitation: Arkansas, Kansas, Nebraska, New Mexico, 
and Vermont

JOB ANNOUNCEMENT: FACULTY POSITION IN GEOSCIENCES

The University of Nevada, Reno, Department of Geological Sciences and 
Engineering is searching for a full-time, tenure-track Assistant 
Professor in the Geosciences. The areas of research expertise for the 
position are intentionally broad. We seek an outstanding geoscientist 
whose research and teaching strengths complement the existing 
department faculty. A willingness and experience to be involved with 
interdisciplinary earth science research is highly desirable.  
Experience in field-based research and ability to teach field classes 
is also desirable. Applicants must demonstrate the potential to 
establish a teaching and research program with international 
recognition. Excellent communication skills, established record of 
publication commensurate with the applicant's career stage, commitment 
to teaching, and ability to attract external funding are essential.

Further information about the University and Department of Geological 
Sciences and Engineering can be found at 

http://www.unr.edu and www.unr.edu/cos/geology

Applicants should submit a letter summarizing interest and 
qualifications; names, e-mail, postal addresses, and telephone 
numbers of at least three references; a complete vita; and 
electronic copies of up to three of your publications to the Faculty 
Jobs page at 

http://jobs.unr.edu/  

Applications will close on January 15, 2010.

JOB ANNOUNCEMENT: FACULTY POSITION IN EXTRASOLAR PLANET STUDIES

The School of Earth and Space Exploration at Arizona State University 
seeks faculty who wish to engage in collaborative, multidisciplinary 
studies of the nature, formation, and evolution of extrasolar planets. 
Both observational and theoretical studies are of interest. Specific 
research areas might include but are not limited to: spectroscopy of 
planets and their host stars, novel techniques used to search for and 
characterize exoplanets, planetary interior models, and planetary 
dynamics. A demonstrated track record in research, teaching and 
grantsmanship is preferred.

Applications should include: 1) a cover letter that includes a
description of the applicant's research and teaching interests, 2) a 
current CV, and 3) the names, addresses and telephone numbers of three 
references. Inquiries and applications must be addressed to Kip Hodges, 
Director, School of Earth and Space Exploration, and submitted 
electronically to sesenewfac@asu.edu. Submissions in pdf format are 
preferred.

JOB ANNOUNCEMENT: FACULTY POSITION IN PLANETARY ATMOSPHERES 

The School of Earth and Space Exploration at Arizona State University 
seeks new faculty who wish to engage in collaborative, 
multidisciplinary studies of planetary atmospheres. A demonstrated 
track record in research, teaching and grantsmanship is preferred. 
Atmospheres of all planetary bodies are of interest, including those 
of Mars, Titan, gas giants, and hot Jupiter-like planets in extrasolar 
systems.  Areas of interest include: atmospheric dynamics at global, 
regional, or mesoscales, atmospheric state, composition, origin and 
evolution, and surface-atmosphere interactions.  These studies could 
be focused on numerical modeling, observations, data analysis, 
instrument design and development, or some combination of these 
approaches.  Successful applicants will be expected to interact with 
the current and future SESE directions, including planetary surface 
processes and dynamics, astrobiology, climatology, and/or the formation 
and evolution of planets and planetary systems.

Applications should include: 1) a cover letter that includes a 
description of the applicant's research and teaching interests, 
2) a current CV, and 3) the names, addresses and telephone numbers of

ice-rich objects are shaped by processes including tectonics, 
volcanism, impact cratering, and sedimentary processes. Such studies 
would benefit from new perspectives in planetary geomorphology, 
geochemistry, volcanology, hydrology, and/or structural geology, using 
planetary remote sensing, modeling, terrestrial analog investigations, 
or some combination of these approaches.

Applications should include: 1) a cover letter that includes a 
description of the applicant's research and teaching interests, 
2) a current CV, and 3) the names, addresses and telephone numbers of
