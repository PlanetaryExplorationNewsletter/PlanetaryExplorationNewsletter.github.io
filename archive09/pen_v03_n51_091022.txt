DECADAL PRIORITIES POLL NOW OPEN - PRIMITIVE BODIES

End: Tuesday, Oct 27, Noon Pacific

The NRC Planetary Science Decadal Survey will be presented to NASA and 
Congress as the consensus of the planetary community regarding its 
priorities. An online poll has been created by the Small Bodies 
Assessment Group (SBAG) at

https://www.surveymonkey.com/s.aspx?sm=XKZLhGWpvPZBFT_2fWxhU2MA_3d_3d

to provide input on the ranking of priorities from the planetary 
community in the area of primitive bodies. The poll contents were 
gathered from the SBAG-organized community decadal white papers, 
posted at

http://www.psi.edu/decadal

The poll provides for other options to be submitted as well as your 
comments in support of the selections you make for each question.

Poll results and data will be submitted to the Primitive Bodies 
Decadal Panel after the poll closes on Oct 27. It will also be 
posted on the SBAG decadal website above.

Participants in the poll will be able to modify their selections and 
input until the poll is closed.

You opinion and participation is important!
