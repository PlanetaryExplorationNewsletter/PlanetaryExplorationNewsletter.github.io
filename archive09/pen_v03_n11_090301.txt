DECADAL SURVEY FOR THE PLANETARY SCIENCES

The National Research Council's Space Studies Board has been requested 
by NASA and NSF to initiate a decadal survey of the planetary sciences 
to update and expand the 2002 decadal survey, "New Frontiers in the 
Solar System:  An Integrated Exploration Strategy."  A website, 
containing information about the survey, has been established and is 
accessible via <http://www.nas.edu/ssb>.  The survey is currently 
accepting nominations for members of the decadal survey's steering 
group and its supporting panels.  A nomination form is available on the 
website.  Presentations describing the likely scope, organization and 
schedule for the survey will be held at the following meetings:  MEPAG, 
Arlington, Virginia; OPAG, Bethesda, Maryland; Royal Astronomical 
Society, London, England; and LPSC, Houston, Texas.  See the website 
for details.

JOINT ESA-ASI WORKSHOP ON METHANE ON MARS: CURRENT OBSERVATIONS, 
INTERPRETATION AND FUTURE PLANS

25-27 November 2009 -  ESA/ESRIN (Frascati, Italy).

Methane has been detected in the Martian atmosphere by ground-based 
telescopes and from orbit. This discovery indicates that the planet is 
either biologically or geologically active. The goal of the workshop
is to review the available measurements, the potential reservoirs and 
release mechanisms of Methane and its circulation in the atmosphere, 
and to discuss all possible origins of this constituent.

Abstract submission deadline: 1st September 2009

3RD LUNAR REGOLITH SIMULANT WORKSHOP

March 17-20, 2009
Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC)
Huntsville, Alabama

The focus of this Workshop will be on Lunar Regolith Simulant 
Development and Characterization, in addition to Simulant User Needs  
Assessments.  This Workshop is geared towards anyone that will need to  
use simulants, such as technology developers, engineers, scientists,  
and human health researchers. Registration for the Workshop is now 
open at http://isru.msfc.nasa.gov. We look forward to your 
participation.

POLAR PROCESSES ON EARTH AND MARS: COMPARATIVE STUDIES

Session GA22 at the 2009 Joint Assembly, 
24-27 May 2009 

Abstracts due: March 4, 2009 

Go to http://www.agu.org/meetings/ja09/

Polygonal terrain, scalloped depressions, and lineated valley fill 
are seen on Mars. On Earth, these form through glacial and periglacial 
processes. The Phoenix mission has even trenched into the Martian 
subsurface, discovering water ice at only a few centimetres depth. 
Together, these results suggest that the polar and high-altitude 
equatorial terrains of Mars preserve large amounts of ground-ice and 
potentially debris covered surface ice (glaciers), which periodically 
may melt to provide transient water sources. But how can we be certain 
of this? A fundamental paradigm is that interpretations of Mars – and 
other planetary bodies – must begin by understanding and using the 
Earth as a reference. This introduces the concept of terrestrial 
analogues, which are settings on Earth that may approximate, in some 
respect, the geological features and/or environmental conditions on 
Mars or other planetary bodies, either at present or sometime in the 
past. The goal of this session is to bring together a wide range of 
Earth and planetary scientists interested in cold-climate 
geomorphological processes.

REMINDER - THE LUNAR EXPLORATION ROADMAP

The Lunar Exploration Analysis Group (LEAG) needs your help once again 
with developing the Lunar Exploration Roadmap. We have taken earlier 
input and now have driven down to Objectives and Investigations. We now 
need the community to review these and vote on their time-phasing and 
prioritization.  

Please note that this is a far more extensive web site and we are not 
requesting that you respond to every question! We would like you to 
address those questions in the areas where your expertise is. 

YOUR INPUT IS VITAL FOR THE SUCCESS OF THIS ROADMAP, 

as it needs to be a community effort.

The web site can be found at:

Make sure "leag" and the password are in lower case letters.

[NASA] PDS RELEASES DATA FROM THE PHOENIX LANDER MISSION

The NASA Planetary Data System announces the second release of data 
from the Mars Phoenix Lander mission, including raw and derived 
products from Sols 31 - 90, collected June 26 - August 26, 2009.  
The release includes EDR and RDR data sets for most instruments.

Phoenix data may be accessed from the PDS Atmospheres, Geosciences, 
and Imaging nodes' web sites and from the main PDS home page, 
http://pds.nasa.gov/ or 
http://pds.nasa.gov/subscription_service/SS-20090223.html

PDS offers two services for searching the Phoenix archives:
  -  The Planetary Image Atlas at the Imaging Node:
http://pds-imaging.jpl.nasa.gov/search/phoenix/
  -  The Phoenix Analyst's Notebook at the Geosciences Node:
http://an.rsl.wustl.edu/phx

One more Phoenix data release is scheduled. Release 3 will occur on 
April 29, 2009.  

To receive email announcements of future releases of Phoenix data, 
please use the PDS Subscription Service at:

[NASA] PROPOSAL WRITING WORKSHOP AT LPSC 

NASA will again sponsor a Proposal Writing Workshop at LPSC this year.  
The workshop will be held on Sunday, March 22, from 1-5 pm at the 
conference hotel. The workshop is open to all interested planetary 
scientists from senior graduate students to senior scientists.  There 
will be no charge for the workshop.  The workshop will focus on 
understanding NASA's research programs and will include information on 
how to write a research proposal, where to apply for funding, and what 
kind of feedback one can expect.  Other opportunities for funding, such 
as participating scientist programs and education/public outreach 
add-on awards, will also be discussed.  To register please email Curt 
Niebur (curt.niebur@nasa.gov) with your name, institution, and 
position.
