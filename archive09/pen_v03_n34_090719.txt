[NASA] OPENING OF COMPETITIVE PROGRAM FOR SCIENCE MUSEUMS AND 
PLANETARIUMS SOLICITATION 

NASA has announced a competitive funding opportunity for informal 
education that could result in the award of grants or cooperative 
agreements to several of the nation's science centers, museums and 
planetariums. Approximately $6 million is available for new awards.

Proposals for the Competitive Program for Science Museums and 
Planetariums are expected to use NASA resources to enhance informal 
education programs related to space exploration, aeronautics, space 
science, Earth science or microgravity. Full proposals are due 
Sept. 10. 

For detailed information about the opportunity, click on "Open 
Solicitations" and look for Competitive Program for Science Museums 
and Planetariums (CP4SMP) or solicitation number NNH09ZNE005N at:

[NASA] ADMINISTRATIVE CHANGE TO NEW FRONTIERS 2009 AO

An administrative change is being made to the Announcement of
Opportunity (AO) for New Frontiers 2009 (NNH09ZDA007O).  90 copies of
the proposal are required to be submitted.  The proposal due date and
all other requirements remain unchanged.

Requirement 86 on page 46 now reads:  "Requirement 86. The original
signed proposal and 90 paper copies, each of which contains an
attached, clearly labeled CD-ROM that contains electronic proposal
files (see Appendix B), shall be delivered to the following address
by the proposal submittal deadline specified in Section 3."

The New Frontiers 2009 AO (NNH09ZDA007O) is available on the NASA
research opportunity homepage at 

http://nspires.nasaprs.com/ 

(select "Solicitations" then "Open Solicitations" then 
"NNH09ZDA007O").

Further information about the New Frontiers 2009 AO is available 
from Dr. Thomas H. Morgan, Tel.: (202) 358-0828; E-mail:
Thoma.H.Morgan@nasa.gov (subject line to read "NEW FRONTIERS AO").

EXOPLANET EXPLORATION PROGRAM ANALYSIS GROUP (EXOPAG)

The Astrophysics Division of NASA's Science Mission Directorate is 
pleased to announce the establishment an Exoplanet Exploration Program
Analysis Group, or ExoPAG. The ExoPAG will be an open, 
interdisciplinary forum for gathering community input into NASA's 
Exoplanet Exploration Program (ExEP), and for conducting analyses in 
support of ExEP science objectives and their implications for planning
and prioritization of Program activities. The ExoPAG will communicate 
its findings and the results of its analyses to NASA through the 
Agency's formal advisory structure in the form of reports to the 
Astrophysics Subcommittee of the NAC (NASA Advisory Council) Science
Committee.

To carry out its role, the ExoPAG will:

* Articulate the key scientific drivers for exoplanet research;
* Evaluate the expected capabilities of potential ExEP missions for
  achieving the science goals of the Program;
* Regularly evaluate ExEP goals, objectives, investigations and 
  required measurements on the basis of the widest possible community 
  outreach;
* Articulate focus areas for needed mission technologies; and
* Identify related activities that enhance the ExEP mission portfolio
  such as ground-based observing, theory and modeling programs, and 
  community engagement.

nominations, go to

UCF WINTER SCHOOL 6-8 JANUARY 2010: EXOPLANETS FOR PLANETARY 
SCIENTISTS

The University of Central Florida Planetary Sciences Group is pleased
to announce:

UCF Winter School 2010: Exoplanets for Planetary Scientists
University of Central Florida Campus
Orlando, Florida, USA

6-8 January 2010

http://planets.ucf.edu/winterschool2010

This warm winter workshop will bring together experts in exoplanet
observation and planetary theory, delivering both the latest research
results and school-style talks on applying planetary science to
exoplanetary problems.  We hope you will join us!

AGU SPECIAL SESSION

Description:  
This session is intended to explore the current debate about the 
natural hazards posed by meteorite impacts. We welcome process-oriented
approaches that incorporate field and analytical data from known or 
suspected impact sites as well as numerical simulations of impact 
effects. Several investigators have recently claimed that an 
unexpectedly large number of impacts has occurred during the 
Quaternary, a debate that will be explored in this session. The 
climatic consequences of atmospheric and marine impacts needs 
further elucidation and possible links between human history and 
meteorite impacts is a subject of intense current interest. We seek 
contributions on observations, theoretical and numerical studies of 
chemical, physical, geochemical and biological processes specific to 
impacts. We solicit presentations that critically analyze the relevance
of field and analytical data on impact hazards (thermal radiation, 
wildfires, tsunamis, storms, drought, rain acidification, 
contamination) in terms of timing, magnitude, regional extent and
perceptions by human populations.

21ST MEPAG MEETING, JULY 29-30, 2009

Dear Colleagues,

As the MEPAG meeting on July 29-30 approaches, I'm sending the 
revised agenda and also I want to highlight some important aspects 
of this meeting to you, the Mars community.

1) We will have an update on the MSL mission providing the most up 
to date information on its development.

2) There will be extensive discussion of the science goals and 
directions for the exploration of Mars through a combination of 
MEPAG-sponsored white papers and community-initiated white papers. 
This will provide a key foundation of input to the Decadal Survey 
deliberations that begin in earnest this fall.  We have structured 
the meeting to allow for significant discussion of these and their 
importance to Mars science and mission priorities. It is important 
to note that this is the only opportunity that the MEPAG community 
can get together in an open forum and provide broad input and 
guidance.

The next MEPAG meeting will be after the Mars panel for the decadal 
survey has completed its analysis.  There will be representation 
from the Decadal Survey at this meeting and the directions and 
priorities presented will be noted and conveyed to the survey.

See you in Providence.

Jack Mustard
MEPAG Chair
