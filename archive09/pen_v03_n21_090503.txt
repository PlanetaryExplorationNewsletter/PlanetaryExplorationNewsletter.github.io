EPSC SESSION ON EXPLORING THE MARTIAN MOONS

A session on "Exploring the Martian moons" is organised at the upcoming 
EPSC conference, to be held in Potsdam (Germany) on 13-18 September 
2009. We invite papers on the results of past or present planetary 
missions on the Martian Moons, and on Phobos in particular. The 
following topics can be addressed: position, interior, mass 
determination, volume, subsurface, surface properties, temperatures, 
composition, geology, origin, solar wind interaction. Papers on the 
future mission Phobos-Grunt are welcome. Ground-based observations 
results are also relevant.

Deadline: 8 May 2009

Conveners: O. Witasse and T. Duxbury

"DISCOVERIES IN PLANETARY SCIENCE" CLASSROOM POWERPOINTS

The Education Subcommittee of the AAS Division for Planetary Sciences 
announces the inaugural release of "Discoveries in Planetary Science" 
Classroom Powerpoints. These are succinct summaries of discoveries too 
recent to appear in "Intro Astronomy" college textbooks; each set 
consists of just three slides to be shown: the discovery itself, a 
basic explanation based on good planetary science, and the "big 
picture" context. Another page for further information is provided as 
well. The first set covers Mars Methane, Extrasolar Planet Imaging, The 
Chaotic Early Solar System, Mars Sulfur Chemistry, and Mercury 
Volcanism. Powerpoints and pdf's can be downloaded from 
http://dps.aas.org/education/dpsdisc. Planetary scientists with recent 
or upcoming results of broad interest are encouraged to submit them for 
consideration by providing an initial draft using the template provided 
on the website. For more information, contact Nick Schneider & Dave 
Brain at dpsdisc@aas.org

PLANETARY GEOMORPHOLOGY IMAGE OF THE MONTH

The May 'Image of the month' is now available at the IAG's Planetary 
Geomorphology web page

OSEWG 2009 WORKSHOP ON ROBOTS SUPPORTING HUMAN SCIENCE AND EXPLORATION

August 5-6, 2009

Lunar and Planetary Institute (LPI)
Universities Space Research Association (USRA)
3600 Bay Area Boulevard
Houston, Texas, 77058.

This workshop will investigate how robotics might best be used to 
support a sustainable program of human exploration and science on the 
Moon.  The objective is to identify areas where high-priority lunar 
science needs can be met with space robotics capabilities, while 
fostering improved understanding and communication between the 
communities.  The workshop will engage the Lunar Science and Space 
Robotics communities to include expertise from both domains.

[NASA] PDS FINAL RELEASE OF PHOENIX DATA

The NASA Planetary Data System announces the third and final release of 
data from the Mars Phoenix Lander mission. This release includes raw 
and derived data products from Sols 91 through 152, July 27 - 
October 29, 2008.

Data are being released for the following experiments:  

ASE - EDRs only
MET LIDAR and Pressure-Temperature Sensors (includes reprocessing of 
data from Releases 1 and 2.)
MECA (TECP, AFM, and WCL only; AFM RDRs to be released by
approximately June 1, 2009)
TEGA
Telltale Anemometer

For OM, RAC and SSI data, please check the Imaging Node site for
release status: 

http://pds-imaging.jpl.nasa.gov.

Phoenix data are archived at the PDS Atmospheres, Geosciences, and 
Imaging Nodes. The data may be accessed from these nodes' web sites or 
from

http://pds.nasa.gov/subscription_service/SS-20090429.html

PDS offers two services for searching the Phoenix archives:

The Planetary Image Atlas at the Imaging Node allows selection of
Phoenix data by specific search criteria.

http://pds-imaging.jpl.nasa.gov/search/phoenix/

The Phoenix Analyst's Notebook at the Geosciences Node allows searching
and browsing of Phoenix data in the context of mission events, for the
expert user.

[NASA] GROUP 5 UNIVERSITY RESEARCH CENTERS (URC) ANNOUNCEMENT

The NASA Office of Education, Integration Division, Minority University 
Research and Education Program (MUREP) has released a solicitation for 
proposals for the NASA Group 5 University Research Centers (URC), 
Announcement Number NNH09ZNE003C.  This solicitation is in cooperation 
with NASA's four Mission Directorates - Aeronautics Research, 
Exploration Systems, Science, and Space Operations and NASA's ten Field 
Centers.  Each University Research Center (URC) is expected to be a 
multi-disciplinary scientific, engineering and/or commercial research 
center designed to provide a broad-based, competitive NASA-related 
research capability among the Nation's Minority Institutions, foster 
new aerospace science and technology concepts, provide mechanisms for 
expanded participation by faculty and students of Minority Institutions 
in mainstream research, and increase the number of underrepresented and 
underserved U.S. students obtaining advanced degrees in NASA-related 
fields and entering the aerospace workforce. All institutions 
designated by the Department of Education as a Historically Black 
College or University, Hispanic-Serving Institution, or 
Minority-Serving Institution are eligible to apply for this cooperative 
agreement funding opportunity.

Notices of Intent are due May 22, 2009.  The closing date for receipt 
of proposals is June 19, 2009.
