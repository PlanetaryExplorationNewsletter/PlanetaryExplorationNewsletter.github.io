STUDENT RAPPORTEURS NEEDED AT NRC PLANETARY DECADAL SURVEY MEETINGS

The Planetary Science Decadal Survey expresses its sincere thanks to 
the graduate-student rapporteurs who have taken notes at all of the 
survey's meetings to date.  The survey is now looking for rapporteurs 
to cover forthcoming meetings of the Steering Group and its five 
Panels.  These notes will be posted on the survey√ïs website for use by 
survey members and the larger planetary science community.

Attending a meeting will give students the unique opportunity to
experience an insider's view of the activities of Planetary Science
Decadal Survey; plus the opportunity to interact with committee 
members, briefers and agency officials.  The SSB is not able to 
provide travel or lodging expenses.  However, students will receive a 
small honorarium as well as meals during the meetings.  Please note 
that students will need to sign a non-disclosure agreement to 
participate in closed sessions.

More information, including the application procedure and list of
meeting dates and locations, can be found at

Additional information about the decadal survey, including draft 
agendas for meetings in October, is available at
