DIGITIZED LUNAR ORBITER DATA AVAILABLE ONLINE IN THE PLANETARY DATA
SYSTEM

A Planetary Data System (PDS) archive of digitized Lunar Orbiter (LO) 
data from missions III, IV, and V is available online at 

http://pdsmaps.wr.usgs.gov/PDS/public/lunar_orbiter/LO_Archive.html 

Data for this archive were created at USGS by scanning film strips at 
25 microns, constructing frame mosaics, performing cosmetic correction 
(including stripe removal), and map-projecting the frames.  Included 
in this archive are LO digitized film strips and various levels of 
processed data, as well as documentation describing the LO mission, 
instruments, and processing steps.  Please check the above Web site 
for updates to the archive as it is populated.  This archive 
complements the online Lunar Orbiter data projects at USGS:

http://astrogeology.usgs.gov/Projects/LunarOrbiterDigitization/) 

and at LPI:
 
http://www.lpi.usra.edu/resources/lunar_orbiter/

This work was carried out by the Astrogeology Science Center of the 
U.S. Geological Survey in Flagstaff, Arizona, with funding from the 
Cartography Program of the NASA Planetary Geology and Geophysics and 
the NASA Lunar Precursor Robotic Programs.
