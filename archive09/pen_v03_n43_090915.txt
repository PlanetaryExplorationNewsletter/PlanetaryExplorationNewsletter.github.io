[NASA] SBAG DECADAL WORKSHOP AT DPS - TIME CHANGE AGAIN!

October 7, Wednesday, **** 12:30-2:00 PM ****
Room: Vieques

The workshop no longer conflicts with a memorial session on asteroid
imaging honoring Steve Ostro.

This workshop will be to debate priorities for the decadal survey
in the area of small bodies. This is in support of the Primitive
Bodies Decadal Panel. SBAG organized seven community white papers, 
now submitted, that identified top-level science issues and mission 
priorities within the subdisciplines of Near-Earth Asteroids, 
Asteroids, Comets, Dwarf Planets, Small Satellites, Centaurs and 
Small Irregular TNOs, and Interplanetary Dust. The next task is to 
prioritize the science issues and the recommended future NASA 
missions across the entire primitive bodies field.

These white papers, in addition to more narrowly focused topical 
papers are available at

http://www.psi.edu/decadal

The workshop will commence with five minute presentations on each 
of the seven community white papers mentioned above, followed by 
an open discussion.

Assessment Group, please go to
