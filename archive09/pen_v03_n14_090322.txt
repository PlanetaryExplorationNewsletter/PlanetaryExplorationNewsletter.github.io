ARCHITECTURE ISSUES ASSOCIATED WITH SAMPLING FINAL REPORT AVAILABLE

The final report is now available from the "Workshop on Architecture  
Issues Associated with Sampling" which was conducted by the Optimizing  
Science and Exploration Working Group (OSEWG) and the Lunar Exploration 
Analysis Group (LEAG) at the Lunar and Planetary Institute (LPI) in 
Houston, TX. The report is posted online at

[NASA] 21ST ANNUAL PLANETARY SCIENCE SUMMER SCHOOL

NASA is accepting applications from science and engineering post-docs, 
recent PhDs, and doctoral students for its 21st Annual Planetary 
Science Summer School, which will hold two separate sessions this 
summer (20-24 July and 3-7 August) at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in 
Pasadena, Calif. During the program, student teams will carry out the 
equivalent of an early mission concept study, prepare a proposal 
authorization review presentation, present it to a review board, and 
receive feedback. At the end of the week, students will have a clearer 
understanding of the life cycle of a robotic space mission; 
relationships between mission design, cost, and schedule; and the 
tradeoffs necessary to stay within cost and schedule while preserving 
the quality of science. Applications are due 1 May 2009. Partial 
financial support is available for a limited number of individuals.

May 17-20, 2009

The Workshop on the Physics of Dusty Plasma website is open for 
abstract submission. The submission deadline has bee extended by 1 week 
till March 27. The workshop will cover all aspects of dusty plasmas, 
including theory, experiments, the lunar near-surface environment, 
space observations, mesospheric charged aerosols and others. Please
