NASA PLANETARY RESEARCH AT THE KECK OBSERVATORY
 
Many of you may know about the January 26th posting on NASA Watch 
titled: "Weiler Seeks to Cut NASA Access to Keck Observatory." Just to 
make things unequivocally clear, there is absolutely no change in 
NASA's position to honor the 5-year cooperative agreement for KECK 
operations that was put in place last fiscal year. Also, Dr. Weiler 
has not been involved in any discussion relevant to KECK since he has 
returned to NASA Headquarters in the Spring of 2008.
 
The KECK Observatory provides important support for the Planetary 
Science Division's goals and objectives.  The Planetary Science 
Division is committed to maintaining this support.  Recent email and 
web traffic have not accurately reflected the actual situation. My 
email to a KECK user, informally soliciting information from observers 
to support the Planetary Science Division's position, led to this. 
I regret any misunderstanding that may have been engendered. Please be 
assured that we can move forward knowing that KECK will be around a 
long time to support our mission needs. If you are still have concerns, 
I urge you to talk directly to me or Jim Green, the Planetary Science 
Division Director.
