[NASA] LEARNING TECHNOLOGIES PROJECT OFFICE RELEASES FY 2009 
COOPERATIVE AGREEMENT NOTICE

The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Goddard 
Space Flight Center's Learning Technologies Project Office (LTPO) 
has released a Cooperative Agreement Notice (CAN) to conduct research
and evaluation on the design and usage of Massively Multiplayer 
Online Games (MMOG) and Persistent Immersive Synthetic Environments 
(Virtual Worlds) for NASA Science, Technology, Engineering and 
Mathematics (STEM) Education and Training.

This solicitation seeks proposals that communicate the required 
approach and skills to contribute to NASA and other federal agencies,
private industry and academia's research initiatives to improve STEM
content and delivery approaches that promote the development of our 
nation's future workforce, workforce applications, and missions.

The LTPO NASA Cooperative Agreement Notice is available on the NASA 
Headquarters solicitations website: http://nspires.nasaprs.com.  
Additionally, any Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) that arise after 
the announcement is released will be posted on NSPIRES.

JOB ANNOUNCEMENT

The Space Science and Engineering Center, Univ. of Wisconsin-Madison, 
seeks a postdoctoral Research Associate in Planetary Atmospheres, for 
analysis of imaging and spectroscopic observations of the outer 
planets under the direction of Senior Scientist Dr. L. A. Sromovsky.
Extensive data sets to be analyzed are from the Keck II telescope and 
NASA Infrared Telescope, the Hubble Space Telescope, and from the 
Galileo, Cassini, and New Horizons missions.  The primary analysis 
targets are the cloud structures and parent gas mixing ratios on 
Jupiter, Uranus, and Neptune.  Applications are due by 31 July 2009.

GRADUATE STUDENT OPPORTUNITY TO PARTICIPATE IN PLANETARY SCIENCE 
DECADAL SURVEY

The Planetary Science Decadal Survey extends an invitation to graduate
students to act as observers/rapporteurs during meetings of the 
Planetary Science Decadal Survey's Steering Group and its five Panels.
These notes will be posted on the decadal survey's website for use by 
survey members and the larger planetary science community.

Attending a meeting will give students the unique opportunity to 
experience an insider's view of the activities of Planetary Science 
Decadal Survey; plus the opportunity to interact with committee 
members, briefers and agency officials.  The SSB is not able to provide
travel or lodging expenses.  However, students will receive a small 
honorarium as well as meals during the meetings.  Please note that 
students will need to sign a non-disclosure agreement to participate
in closed sessions.

More information, including the application procedure and list of 
meeting dates and locations, can be found at:
