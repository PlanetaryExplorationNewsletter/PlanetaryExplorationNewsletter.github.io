[NASA] PROPOSAL SUBMISSION REQUIRES TEAM MEMBER ORGANIZATIONAL 
RELATIONSHIP

This email is to update you on changes that will be made to NSPIRES 
on August 8, 2009.   These changes will affect submission of 
proposals to NASA, and are being implemented to improve the process 
by which potential conflicts of interest are determined.

For a proposal to be submitted after August 7, 2009, all proposal 
team members must confirm an organizational relationship, i.e., 
identify the organization through which they are participating in a 
given proposal.  A proposal will not be able to be submitted if an 
organizational relationship is missing for any team member, 
regardless of role on the proposal (e.g. Co-I, collaborator, etc).

Explanatory procedures are in place here to guide both existing and 
prospective team members through this process.   

If you have questions regarding this email, or any other NSPIRES 
business, please contact the NSPIRES Help Desk:

[NASA] OFFICE OF EDUCATION ACCEPTING PROPOSALS FOR K-12 COOPERATIVE 
AGREEMENTS NOTICE

The NASA Office of Education has released a Cooperative Agreement 
Notice for proposals for NASA K-12 Cooperative Agreements Notice 
(K-12 CAN). The K-12 CAN effort seeks proposals that incorporate 
innovative approaches for development and delivery of instructional 
materials, creates experiences that capture the interest of learners, 
and actively involves participants in relevant, NASA science, 
technology, engineering, and mathematics, or STEM, content 
applications. The instructional materials and experiences of the 
proposal should support secondary level teaching and learning, with 
a particular emphasis on high school education.

The K-12 CAN is available electronically through the NASA 
Solicitation and Proposal Integrated Review and Evaluation System 
(NSPIRES) 

http://nspires.nasaprs.com
 
Proposals should be submitted electronically via: 

http://nspires.nasaprs.com

Proposal due date is September 25, 2009, at 11:59 p.m. EST. The 
electronic submission of each proposal's Cover Page/Proposal 
Summary/Budget Summary is required by the due date for proposal 
submission.

Please send direct questions regarding this solicitation to:

[NASA PDS] CASSINI ISS AND VIMS DATA RELEASE 22

The Planetary Data System (PDS) announces the availability of the 
Cassini Imaging Science Subsystem (ISS) and Visual and Infrared 
Mapping Spectrometer (VIMS) Data Release #22. There was no Cassini 
RADAR data in Cassini Data Release 22.  This data can be found on 
the PDS Imaging Node website at URL:

http://img.pds.nasa.gov/  

The PDS Imaging Node now contains all released Cassini ISS, RADAR 
and VIMS data captured through 2009-09-30 (2009-273).

[NASA] LETTER FROM SARA: TEAM MEMBERS ON NSPIRES

A letter has been released by SARA. It can be found online at:

The letter involves the change coming on August 8 to NSPIRES, the web
page through which proposals are submitted at NASA.

FALL AGU SPECIAL SESSION: POTENTIAL BIOMARKERS ON MARS

Steve Vance and Michael Mumma

Please consider contributing an abstract to this special session of 
the AGU fall 2009 meeting in San Francisco, December 14 - 18.  
Abstracts are due Sept. 3.

P18: Potential Biomarkers on Mars: Detection, Characterization and 
     Earth Analogue Systems

Recent reports of localized release of methane on Mars, discoveries 
of aqueously altered terrains and revelations about the ubiquity of 
water invite comparison with biological and abiological geosystems 
on Earth. This session invites discussion of processes and locales 
on Earth that relate to mechanisms for the production and 
preservation of biomarkers, along with discussion of their 
manifestations on Mars.

FALL AGU SESSION: NH26 PLANETARY DEFENSE AGAINST HAZARDOUS ASTEROIDS: 
SCIENCE, TECHNOLOGY AND POLICY TO MITIGATE THE THREATS

http://www.agu.org/meetings/fm09/program/scientific_session_search.php
  
Conveners:  Margaret Race, SETI Institute and
            David Morrison, NASA Ames Research Center
  
Asteroids represent a natural hazard that can impact Earth and cause 
damage ranging from local, to regional or even global scales, 
depending on their sizes. In the past decade, understanding of the 
hazards and risks has grown considerably through systematic research 
in detection , tracking and characterization of near earth objects 
(NEOs). The increased awareness of hazardous NEOs has encouraged 
researchers in many fields to focus on important related topics such 
as deflection technologies, forecasting and impact modeling, and 
analysis of emergency response, preparedness, and public communication
needs. Recently, discussions also focused on the need for developing
effective, international coordination in decision making and disaster 
management in order to mitigate future threats. This session solicits
abstracts on research and findings related to planetary defense and 
will include presentations on fundamental scientific research as well
as technological, policy and societal areas aimed at hazard mitigation
and disaster management worldwide.

results relating to the relationship between structure and isotopic 
anomalies of the organic matter in extraterrestrial materials such as
meteorites, IDPs, and Stardust samples.  For more information see

FALL AGU SPECIAL SESSION: YOUNG VALLEY FEATURES ON MARS AND THE
MARTIAN FLUVIAL RECORD

We encourage contributions for a special session of the AGU fall 2009
meeting examining young fluvial features on Mars.  The abstract
deadline is September 3.

-Caleb Fassett, Alan Howard, and Jeff Moore

Deeply incised ancient valley networks (>3.5 Ga) have long been
recognized on Mars, but new high resolution images have revealed
extensive Hesperian (<3.5 Ga) and Amazonian-age (<2 Ga) channel
systems. These range from the very young gully systems on steep scarps
to larger (10's to 100's of km) networks extending to at least the
mid-Amazonian.  Formative mechanisms for these young networks remain
enigmatic because of the presumed cold hyperarid climate below the
triple point of water. The existence of young channel networks implies
a hydrologically active recent Mars and either large inventories of
near-surface water/ice or episodes of active atmospheric water cycling.
We solicit contributions related to the distribution, ages, and
processes forming recent martian channel systems from gullies to young
valley networks. Presentations related to terrestrial analogs are also
appropriate.
