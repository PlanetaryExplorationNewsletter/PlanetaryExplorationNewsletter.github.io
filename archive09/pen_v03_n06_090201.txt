POLAR PROCESSES ON EARTH AND MARS: COMPARATIVE STUDIES

Session GA22 at the 2009 Joint Assembly, 24-27 May 2009
Abstracts due: March 4, 2009

Polygonal terrain, scalloped depressions, and lineated valley fill 
are seen on Mars. On Earth, these form through glacial and periglacial 
processes. The Phoenix mission has even trenched into the Martian 
subsurface, discovering water ice at only a few centimetres depth. 
Together, these results suggest that the polar and high-altitude 
equatorial terrains of Mars preserve large amounts of ground-ice and 
potentially debris covered surface ice (glaciers), which periodically 
may melt to provide transient water sources. But how can we be certain 
of this? A fundamental paradigm is that interpretations of Mars - and 
other planetary bodies - must begin by understanding and using the 
Earth as a reference. Terrestrial analogues are settings on Earth that 
may approximate, in some respect, the geological features and/or 
environmental conditions on Mars or other planetary bodies, either at 
present or sometime in the past. The goal of this session is to bring 
together a wide range of Earth and planetary scientists interested in 
cold-climate geomorphological processes.

LUNAR SECULAR EVOLUTION

Session CG11 at the 2009 Joint Assembly, 24-27 May, 2009.
Toronto, Canada
Abstracts due: March 4, 2009
Go to http://www.agu.org/meetings/ja09/

Convenors: 
Surdas Mohit (UBC) smohit@eos.ubc.ca 
John Spray (UNB) jgs@unb.ca 
Catherine Johnson (UBC) cjohnson@eos.ubc.ca
Phil McCausland (U Western Ontario) pmccausl@uwo.ca

In recognition of renewed interest in the Moon and the fleet of new 
missions from a variety of countries that will soon usher in a new era 
of lunar exploration, this session is intended to summarize our current 
state of knowledge regarding the evolution of the Moon and look forward 
to the future of lunar science. Research on all aspects of the 
geologic, thermal, chemical, mechanical, and magnetic evolution of the 
Moon is welcome, drawn from remote-sensing data as well as studies of 
meteorites, returned samples and lunar analogue materials. Papers that 
integrate multiple suites of observations into a coherent framework and 
discuss the observations needed to advance our state of knowledge in a 
given area are particularly encouraged.

NEXT MEETING OF THE VENUS EXPLORATION ANALYSIS GROUP

The next meeting of the Venus Exploration Analysis Group (VEXAG) will 
be February 25, 2009 at the Lunar and Planetary Institute in Houston, 
Texas. Please visit the VEXAG website to register for the meeting:

http://www.lpi.usra.edu/vexag/

The results of the Venus Flagship Science and Technology Definition 
Team will be presented, and the exploration goals, objectives, and  
critical measurement requirements for Venus exploration will be
updated in preparation for the upcoming NRC Decadal Survey. VEXAG is 
NASA's community-based forum designed to provide scientific input and 
technology development plans for planning and prioritizing the 
exploration of Venus over the next several decades.

The Venus Geochemistry workshop will follow VEXAG on Feb 26-27, 2009  
at the Gilruth Center at NASA-JSC.

[NASA] PDS PUBLISHES NEW GUIDELINES FOR CARTOGRAPHIC DATA PRODUCTS

NASA Planetary Data System cartographic standards have not been updated 
in over a decade, although both U.S. and international bodies have 
expanded and refined the underlying sets of reference frames and 
coordinate systems.  Chapter 2 in the PDS Standards Reference, which 
covers this topic, has recently been rewritten. The new version 
provides information on how cartographic standards are established and 
PDS recommendations on how they should be applied to create data 
products for planets and satellites, small bodies, rings and planetary 
plasmas.  Examples of PDS keywords for appropriate planetary coordinate 
systems and reference frames are also provided.  There is no need to 
change existing data pipelines; but anyone planning new products or 
designing a new archive should review the updated material, now 
available online at 

http://pds.nasa.gov/tools/standards-reference.shtml.
