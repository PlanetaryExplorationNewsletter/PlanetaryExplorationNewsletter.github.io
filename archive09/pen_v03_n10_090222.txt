P04: Great Enceladus Debates: Plumes, Beams, Ocean, Chemistry?
Conveners: Claudia Alexander and Robert Pappalardo
Focus: Such debates as the nature of the south polar
geology, the nature of the plume its and interaction with the
magnetosphere, and the nature of the sub-surface.

SM03:Saturn Gas and Plasma: Sources, Losses and Transport
Convener: Abigail Rymer; Todd Smith
Focus: To unify our understanding of Saturn's magnetosphere with 
emphasis on gas and plasma sources and interactions, losses (including
acceleration and/or cooling processes) and transport at Saturn.

Not specifically Cassini-oriented, but maybe of interest:
P06: Comparative Studies of Planetary Magnetospheres
Convener:    Eun-Hwa Kim; Peter Chi; Scott A. Boardsen; Peter Delamere
Focus: Observations, theories and modeling of physical process in the 
magnetospheres of planets, moons, and comets; the coupling processes 
between the magnetosphere and other regions (e.g., ionosphere, 
exosphere, and solar wind).
