JOB ANNOUNCEMENT:  FACULTY POSITION IN PLANETARY ATMOSPHERES

The School of Earth and Space Exploration at Arizona State University 
seeks new faculty who wish to engage in collaborative, multi-
disciplinary studies of planetary atmospheres. A demonstrated track 
record in research, teaching and grantsmanship is preferred. 
Atmospheres of all planetary bodies are of interest, including those 
of Mars, Titan, gas giants, and hot Jupiter-like planets in extrasolar 
systems.  Areas of interest include: atmospheric dynamics at global, 
regional, or mesoscales, atmospheric state, composition, origin and 
evolution, and surface-atmosphere interactions.  These studies could be 
focused on numerical modeling, observations, data analysis, instrument 
design and development, or some combination of these approaches.  
Successful applicants will be expected to interact with the current and 
future SESE directions, including planetary surface processes and 
dynamics, astrobiology, climatology, and/or the formation and evolution 
of planets and planetary systems.

Applications should include: 1) a cover letter that includes a 
description of the applicant's research and teaching interests, 
2) a current CV, and 3) the names, addresses and telephone numbers of 
three references. Inquiries and applications must be addressed to:

Kip Hodges, Director
School of Earth and Space Exploration

and submitted electronically to: 

sesenewfac@asu.edu

Submissions in pdf format are preferred.

JOB ANNOUNCEMENT:  FACULTY POSITION IN PLANETARY SURFACE PROCESSES

The School of Earth and Space Exploration at Arizona State University 
seeks faculty who wish to engage in collaborative, multidisciplinary 
studies of planetary surface processes. A demonstrated track record in 
research, teaching and grantsmanship is preferred. Specifically, we 
seek applicants with interests in how the surfaces of rocky and ice-
rich objects are shaped by processes including tectonics, volcanism, 
impact cratering, and sedimentary processes. Such studies would benefit 
from new perspectives in planetary geomorphology, geochemistry, 
volcanology, hydrology, and/or structural geology, using planetary 
remote sensing, modeling, terrestrial analog investigations, or some 
combination of these approaches.

Applications should include: 1) a cover letter that includes a 
description of the applicant's research and teaching interests, 
2) a current CV, and 3) the names, addresses and telephone numbers of 
three references. Inquiries and applications must be addressed to:

Kip Hodges, Director
School of Earth and Space Exploration

and submitted electronically to:

JOB ANNOUNCEMENT:  FACULTY POSITION IN EXTRASOLAR PLANET STUDIES

The School of Earth and Space Exploration at Arizona State University 
seeks faculty who wish to engage in collaborative, multidisciplinary 
studies of the nature, formation, and evolution of extrasolar planets. 
Both observational and theoretical studies are of interest. Specific 
research areas might include but are not limited to: spectroscopy of 
planets and their host stars, novel techniques used to search for and 
characterize exoplanets, planetary interior models, and planetary 
dynamics. A demonstrated track record in research, teaching and 
grantsmanship is preferred.
 
Applications should include: 1) a cover letter that includes a 
description of the applicant's research and teaching interests, 
2) a current CV, and 3) the names, addresses and telephone numbers of 
three references. Inquiries and applications must be addressed to:

JOB ANNOUNCEMENT:  POST-DOCTORAL RESEARCHER, LUNAR SAMPLES, UNIVERSITY
OF NOTRE DAME

The University of Notre Dame, department of Civil Engineering and 
Geological Sciences has an opening for a Post Doctoral Researcher 
focusing on Lunar Samples and associated data. The exact mix of 
research responsibilities will depend on the skills and capabilities 
of the selected candidate, although the initial project will focus on 
crystal stratigraphy, melt inclusions and textural analysis of lunar 
samples. This initial project is funded for two years with a 
possibility of an extension beyond this period.

The successful candidate must have completed a PhD in Lunar Science, 
Igneous Petrology and/or Geochemistry. Experience with different 
analytical methods (electron microprobe, ICP-MS, SIMS, etc.) and 
interpretation of geochemical data is strongly preferred. The 
successful candidate will be able to take advantage of the existing 
analytical facilities at Notre Dame that include single and powder XRD, 
single and multi-collector ICP-MS, TEM-SEM.

Interested candidates should send a curriculum vita that contains a 
publication list, a letter discussing their qualifications, research 
interests, and goals, and the names of three professional references 
to: 

Prof. Clive R. Neal (http://www.nd.edu/~cneal) at neal.1@nd.edu

Please include "Lunar Sample Post Doc Position" in the subject line. 
The position will remain open until filled.

The UND is an equal opportunity affirmative action employer.

JOB ANNOUNCEMENT:  POST-DOCTORAL RESEARCHER, PLANETARY SCIENCE,
BOULDER, CO

Southwest Research Institute (SwRI) is seeking applications for a
postdoctoral researcher in planetary science to assist Hal Levison
(hal_at_boulder.swri.edu) in the study of the formation and long-term
dynamical evolution of the Solar System.  This project will involve
studying the Kuiper belt binaries, giant planet core formation, and
Oort cloud formation.  The successful applicant will be expected to
orchestrate their own independent research program in these or related
areas. Requires a PhD in Planetary Science, Astronomy, or a related
field with 0 – 2 years experience after PhD.  Must have a strong
research interest and publication record in the dynamics of small
bodies in the Solar System, and/or the dynamics of planet formation.
A working knowledge of the N-body code known as Swift will be
considered a strong plus.  To apply, please visit our website at
www.swri.jobs.  Reference job code 15-00971.
