POSTDOCTORAL RESEARCHER IN PLANETARY MAPPING

The Lunar and Planetary Institute (LPI), a division of the 
Universities Space Research Association invites applications for a 
postdoctoral fellowship in planetary science. The successful candidate 
will work with Dr. Paul Schenk, investigating the topography of 
Jupiter's volcanic moon Io using stereo and shape-from-shading 
techniques (although experience in these tools is not required).  
A variety of landforms will be mapped, including volcanoes and 
mountains, as well as regional and global scale shape deviations.  
The candidate will also be expected to develop their own research 
projects using these data.

For further information, please visit 

http://www.lpi.usra.edu/lpi/positions.shtml 

or applicants should send a letter of interest, a curriculum vita 
with a list of publications, a brief (maximum three pages) statement 
of research interests, and a list of three references to 
resume@lpi.usra.edu by October 30, 2009.  Review of candidates will 
begin October 31, 2009, with a hiring decision, as soon as possible 
thereafter. The Universities Space Research Association is an Equal 
Opportunity Employer.

POSTDOCTORAL RESEARCHER IN PLANETARY PETROLOGY

The Lunar and Planetary Institute (LPI), a division of the 
Universities Space Research Association, invites applications for a 
postdoctoral fellowship in the petrology of planetary materials. 

The successful candidate will work with Dr. Allan Treiman in 
NASA-funded research focusing on volatiles in magmas and on 
aqueous alteration of igneous rocks; target materials include Martian 
meteorites, lunar samples, and terrestrial analogs.  These efforts 
will start with analyses by optical microscopy and electron 
microprobe; other instruments are available as needed at nearby 
Johnson Space Center (experimental petrology laboratories, LA-ICPMS),
or can be arranged with external collaborators (e.g., SIMS).  The 
candidate will be encouraged to design and conduct her/his own 
research in planetary science, propose for external funding, 
participate in grant review panels and analysis groups, and become 
involved with spacecraft missions.

PLANETARY GEOPHYSICS POSTDOCTORAL FELLOWSHIP

The Universities Space Research Association's Lunar and Planetary 
Institute (LPI) in Houston, Texas, invites applicants to apply for a 
postdoctoral fellowship in planetary geophysics. 

The successful candidate will work with Dr. Walter Kiefer on a 
NASA-funded project studying the nature of mantle convection on Mars 
and its effects on the thermal evolution and volcanic history of the 
planet. The candidate will also have the opportunity to conduct 
research in planetary geophysics of his or her own choosing.

The position requires a Ph.D. in Planetary Science or Geophysics 
and experience in computer programming and numerical modeling methods, 
particularly finite elements. Experience with parallel computing in a 
Linux environment will be an asset.  Further information on current 
research and facilities at the LPI can be found on our website at

POSTDOCTORAL FELLOW IN LUNAR SURFACE GEOLOGY  
 
The Universities Space Research Association's Lunar and Planetary 
Institute (LPI) invites applications for a lunar science and 
exploration postdoctoral fellowship.  We are seeking a motivated 
individual who wants to integrate existing lunar data (e.g., Apollo 
landing site geology, Lunar Orbiter images) with new data from the 
Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter Camera.   Expertise in orbital image 
analysis and planetary geology concepts, particularly impact 
cratering processes, are desirable.  Research activities will 
involve the highest science priorities identified by the NRC's 
(2007) Scientific Context for Exploration of the Moon and will 
likely interface with landing site assessments for NASA's 
Constellation Program.  

The successful candidate should be able to work independently, 
although encouraged to take advantage of the tremendous lunar-related 
expertise in the Houston area.  The successful candidate will be a 
member of the new LPI-JSC Center for Lunar Science and Exploration 

http://www.lpi.usra.edu/nlsi/

which is one of the core teams within the NASA Lunar Science 
Institute.

FACULTY POSITION IN PLANETARY ATMOSPHERES

The School of Earth and Space Exploration at Arizona State University 
seeks new faculty who wish to engage in collaborative, 
multidisciplinary studies of planetary atmospheres. A demonstrated 
track record in research, teaching and grantsmanship is preferred. 
Atmospheres of all planetary bodies are of interest, including those 
of Mars, Titan, gas giants, and hot Jupiter-like planets in 
extrasolar systems.  Areas of interest include: atmospheric dynamics 
at global, regional, or mesoscales, atmospheric state, composition, 
origin and evolution, and surface-atmosphere interactions.  These 
studies could be focused on numerical modeling, observations, data 
analysis, instrument design and development, or some combination of 
these approaches.  Successful applicants will be expected to interact 
with the current and future SESE directions, including planetary 
surface processes and dynamics, astrobiology, climatology, and/or the 
formation and evolution of planets and planetary systems.

Applications should include: 1) a cover letter that includes a 
description of the applicant's research and teaching interests, 
2) a current CV, and 3) the names, addresses and telephone numbers of 
three references. Inquiries and applications must be addressed to:

Kip Hodges
Director
School of Earth and Space Exploration 

and submitted electronically to sesenewfac@asu.edu. Submissions in pdf 
format are preferred.

FACULTY POSITION IN EXTRASOLAR PLANET STUDIES

The School of Earth and Space Exploration at Arizona State University 
seeks faculty who wish to engage in collaborative, multidisciplinary 
studies of the nature, formation, and evolution of extrasolar planets.
Both observational and theoretical studies are of interest. Specific 
research areas might include but are not limited to: spectroscopy of 
planets and their host stars, novel techniques used to search for and
characterize exoplanets, planetary interior models, and planetary 
dynamics. A demonstrated track record in research, teaching and 
grantsmanship is preferred.

Applications should include: 1) a cover letter that includes a 
description of the applicant's research and teaching interests, 2) a 
current CV, and 3) the names, addresses and telephone numbers of 
three references. Inquiries and applications must be addressed to:

FACULTY POSITION IN PLANETARY SURFACE PROCESSES

The School of Earth and Space Exploration at Arizona State University 
seeks faculty who wish to engage in collaborative, multidisciplinary 
studies of planetary surface processes. A demonstrated track record in 
research, teaching and grantsmanship is preferred. Specifically, we 
seek applicants with interests in how the surfaces of rocky and 
ice-rich objects are shaped by processes including tectonics, 
volcanism, impact cratering, and sedimentary processes. Such studies 
would benefit from new perspectives in planetary geomorphology, 
geochemistry, volcanology, hydrology, and/or structural geology, 
using planetary remote sensing, modeling, terrestrial analog 
investigations, or some combination of these approaches.

Applications should include: 1) a cover letter that includes a 
description of the applicant's research and teaching interests, 2) a 
current CV, and 3) the names, addresses and telephone numbers of 
three references. Inquiries and applications must be addressed to:
