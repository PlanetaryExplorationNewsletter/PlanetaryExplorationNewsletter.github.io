LUNAR EXPLORATION ANALYSIS GROUP ANNUAL MEETING ANNOUNCEMENT

The annual meeting of the Lunar Exploration Analysis Group (LEAG) will 
be held November 16-19 at the Lunar & Planetary Institute in Houston, 
Texas. The program will be available on the meeting web site:

http://www.lpi.usra.edu/meetings/leag2009/ 

within the next day or two. The program is comprised of invited and 
contributed talks and, like previous LEAG meetings, sessions will be 
centered around questions and there will be plenty of time for 
discussion. 

The aim of this meeting is to gather community input to the 
"Sustainability" theme of the LEAG-coordinated Lunar Exploration 
Roadmap 

http://www.lpi.usra.edu/leag/ler_draft.shtml

but will begin with community updates from three NASA mission 
directorates, the Lunar Quest Program, the leader of the NASA input 
to the Augustine Commission, the NASA Lunar Science Institute, OSEWG, 
and it is hope these will be headlined by a keynote address from the 
NASA Deputy Administrator, Lori Garver. 

Day 2 of the meeting is devoted solely to the current results of the 
LRO-LCROSS missions.

Day 3 is sponsored by the Space Resources Roundtable and focuses upon 
Lunar In Situ Resource Utilization. 

I hope to see many of you at this meeting.

Sincerely,

Clive R. Neal
(LEAG Chair)

REGISTRATION OPEN FOR NEXT-GEN SUBORBITAL RESEARCHERS CONFERENCE

A new generation of space vehicles capable of economically delivering 
payloads and researchers is coming on line beginning in 2010. These 
vehicles will revolutionize space access by providing frequent, 
low-cost access to space and the capability to carry research and 
education crew members.  They will also carry experiments for 
technology demonstrations, for scientist in-the-loop research, and for 
educational/public outreach demonstrations.

Fields including atmospheric science, solar physics, microgravity 
science, planetary science, space life science, space physics, and 
education and public outreach (EPO) stand to benefit from these 
vehicles.

The Next-Generation Suborbital Researchers Conference (NSRC) will be 
held February 1820, 2010, at The Millennium Harvest House Boulder, 
1345 28th Street, Boulder, Colorado, 80302.

NSRC2010 will provide a forum to learn about the research and EPO 
capabilities of these new systems, their experiments, and EPO 
integration processes.  NSRC2010 will also provide input on vehicle 
design requirements for science and education. Abstracts are due 
November 12th. Go to 

http://www.lpi.usra.edu/meetings/nsrc2010/nsrc20101st.shtml 

for more information.

POSTDOCTORAL POSITION IN EXPERIMENTAL ASTROPHYSICS

A postdoctoral position in experimental astrophysics is available in 
the group of Professor Gianfranco Vidali at Syracuse University, 
Syracuse, NY. The candidate will work on a new project to study the 
formation of molecules on surfaces of interstellar dust analogues. The 
position begins in early 2010 and is for one year renewable for a 
second year. The successful candidate should hold a PhD in physics or 
related field and have a strong experience in ultra-high vacuum and 
surface science techniques. Additional experience in atomic/molecular 
beams and low temperature techniques is a plus. Review of materials 
will begin immediately and applications will be considered until the 
position is filled. For further information about the research in 
Prof. Vidali's group see the Web-site 

http://physics.syr.edu/astro.

For full consideration, qualified candidates must complete 
an online application at www.sujobopps.com (job number 025533) and 
attach their curriculum vitae, a list of publications, a statement 
of their qualifications, and the email/phone numbers of three 
references. Syracuse University is an affirmative action/equal 
opportunity employer. Members of minority groups and women are

POST-DOCTORAL PLANETARY SCIENTIST
 
The Planetary Exploration Group of the Johns Hopkins University Applied
Physics Laboratory has an opening for a Post Doctoral researcher to 
assist in modeling, data analysis and scientific interpretation of 
planetary science data, with an emphasis on gamma-ray and neutron 
spectroscopy data.
 
The successful candidate will participate in the modeling, analysis, 
and/or interpretation of orbital gamma-ray and neutron spectroscopy 
data from various missions.  Specific areas of planetary science study 
include understanding the surface composition of Mercury and the Moon, 
as well as science objectives associated with lunar polar regions 
thought to contain enhanced hydrogen abundances.
 
Applicants must possess a PhD in Planetary Geology, Planetary Physics,
Physics or a related field.  It is desired that applicants possess
experience with reduction, analysis and interpretation of satellite
-based planetary datasets; experience with techniques of gamma-ray 
and neutron transport modeling and/or experience with analysis and 
modeling of energetic particle instrumentation are desired.
 
Interested candidates should send a curriculum vitae that contains a
publication list, a letter discussing their qualifications, research
interests, and goals, and the names of three professional references to 
Dr. David J. Lawrence, David.J.Lawrence@jhuapl.edu.  Please include 
"Lunar and Mercury Post Doc Position" on subject line.

PLANETARY GEOPHYSICS POSTDOCTORAL FELLOWSHIP

The Lunar and Planetary Institute (LPI) in Houston, Texas, a division 
of Universities Space Research Association, invites applicants to apply 
for a postdoctoral fellowship in planetary geophysics. The successful

mantle convection on Mars and its effects on the thermal evolution and 
volcanic history of the planet. The candidate will also have the 
opportunity to conduct research in planetary geophysics of his or her 
own choosing.

The position requires a Ph.D. in Planetary Science or Geophysics and 
experience in computer programming and numerical modeling methods, 
particularly finite elements. Experience with parallel computing in a 
Linux environment will be an asset. The position will be offered for an 
initial period of two years with a possible extension to a maximum of 
three years.

Applicants should send a letter of interest, a CV with list of
