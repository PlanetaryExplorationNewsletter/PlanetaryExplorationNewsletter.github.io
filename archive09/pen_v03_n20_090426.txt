[SPECIAL NASA MESSAGE] JAMES GREEN, PLANETARY SCIENCE DIVISION, ROSE 
2009 SEASON IS UPON US

The Planetary Science Division continues to build a strong supporting
research and technology program using primarily ROSES but also the new
SALMON calls for proposals. The program continues to evolve with time 
and is designed to support the goals and objectives of NASA's 
planetary science program. New calls are devised (ie: participating
scientists, LASER, etc.) but also some calls need to be rewritten
or revised due to overlap with other programs or becoming too 
cobbled up by numerous revisions over time (e.g., PG&G). As the 
program evolves it is important to note that we, at NASA HQ, are
paying close attention to the scope of each program element and so
should you. For example, in ROSES 2008 the PG&G program included the
origin and evolution of the Solar System but this language is not 
included in the description of PG&G this year in ROSES 2009 since
this has clearly been part of the Origins of Solar Systems Program
(ROSES element E.3) since it came out several years ago.

My message to everyone is simply please take the time to read each 
element carefully, put in an NOI, begin writing your proposal early,
then submit your proposals to the most relevant program element
rather than applying to a less appropriate program for historical
reasons. Statistics show that scientists who do that have a greater
chance of winning than those that wait to the last minute.

[NASA] REQUEST FOR INFORMATION - RADIATION CAPABILITIES FOR THE 
EUROPA JUPITER SYSTEM MISSION

The Government is seeking information regarding the state-of-technology
including radiation-hardened parts/components, services, facilities, 
and general expertise, which could prove useful to NASA and instrument
providers in addressing the radiation challenges for the Europa Jupiter
System Mission (EJSM). 

Full details about this Request can be found at:

http://nspires.nasaprs.com/ 

Select "Solicitations" then "Open Solicitations" then "Request for 
Information: NNH09ZDA008L (Radiation Capabilities for the Europa 
Jupiter System Mission)."

Responses to this RFI must be submitted no later than May 22, 2009.

Additional information on the EJSM can be found at:

[NASA] EXPANDING ELIGIBILITY TO PROPOSE FOR SUPPLEMENTAL OUTREACH 
AWARDS AND SUPPLEMENTAL EDUCATION AWARDS

ROSES-09 Amendment 5

This amendment makes ROSES investigators with only 12 months
remaining on the science award eligible to propose to program
elements E.5 and E.6 SUPPLEMENTAL OUTREACH AWARDS and SUPPLEMENTAL
EDUCATION AWARDS.

On or about April 23, 2009, this Amendment to the NASA Research
Announcement "Research Opportunities in Space and Earth Sciences
(ROSES) 2009" (NNH09ZDA001N) will be posted on the NASA research
opportunity homepage at 

http://nspires.nasaprs.com/ 

(select "Solicitations" then "Open Solicitations" then 
"NNH09ZDA001N").

Further information about these program elements is available 
from Dr. Larry Cooper, Science Mission Directorate, NASA Headquarters,
Washington, DC 20546; Telephone: (202) 358-1531; 
Email: larry.p.cooper@nasa.gov.

SUMMER INTERNSHIP AT NASA AMES RESEARCH CENTER

Help us put scientific papers on the map-of Mars!
Here at NASA Ames, we're working with Google, Inc., and the SAO/NASA  
Astrophysics Data System to get scientific papers geo-located on Mars.
Although we'll start with explicitly geo-locating a few, we want to  
enable a system so that the scientific community itself can add geo-
location information to already-published works, and encourage future  
publications to include easier to parse geo-location information.

We need an intern to help us with the following: (1) create an initial
seed of test data, (2) develop the supervised parsing strategies for  
extracting geospatial data from scientific plain text, (3) develop the
information architecture for doing all of this, and (4) create the  
presentation of the geographic data for Google Mars 3D.

If you are interested in applying for this position, please send the  
following via e-mail: (1) a cover letter, and (2) a detailed resume  
(PDF or text) to Dr. Ross.A.Beyer@nasa.gov
