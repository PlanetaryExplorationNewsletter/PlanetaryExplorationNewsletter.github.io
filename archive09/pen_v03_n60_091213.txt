LRO DIVINER SYMPOSIUM AT LPSC

Feb 28, 2010

The LRO Diviner Lunar Radiometer Experiment team will host a symposium
on the Sunday afternoon before the LPSC meeting to acquaint the
community with the Diviner experiment, its dataset and its scientific
findings to date. The meeting will be held in the Montgomery Ballroom 
of the Woodlands Waterway Marriott Hotel and Conference Center in
Houston, TX - the same hotel that is hosting the LPSC meeting, and the
Brown-Vernadsky Microsymposium entitled "Compositional Structure of the
Lunar Crust: The New View from the Moon"

http://www.planetary.brown.edu/html_pages/micro51.htm

The Diviner symposium will directly follow  the Brown-Vernadsky
Microsymposium which is scheduled for all day Saturday and Sunday
morning. A detailed agenda for the Diviner Symposium will be posted in
advance of the meeting on the Diviner web site:

3RD EUROPA JUPITER SYSTEM MISSION INSTRUMENT WORKSHOP

The third Europa Jupiter System Mission (EJSM) Instrument Workshop 
will be held on January 18-20, 2010 at ESA's European Space Research 
and Technology Centre (ESTEC) in Noordwijk, the Netherlands. The first 
two EJSM instrument workshops were held in the US in 2008 and 2009 

https://opfm.jpl.nasa.gov/InstrumentWorkshop

This third EJSM instrument workshop, the first to be held in Europe, 
takes place a few months after the initiation of the EJSM instrument 
studies in Europe, following the ESA Call for Declaration of Interest 
in Instrumentation for the EJSM mission

https://sci.esa.int/science-e/www/object/index.cfm?fobjectid=44490

The main focus of the workshop is to address the technical challenges
(in particular the radiation environment and planetary protection 
requirements) that need to be taken into account by potential EJSM 
instrument providers for both JEO and JGO in preparations for the 
upcoming AO, planned to be issued in early 2011.

Potential European and U.S. instrument providers, who are 
interested in presenting instrument design concepts, their related 
technology developments and their strategies to cope with radiation 
and planetary protection requirements, are invited to submit a brief 
abstract by via the on-line abstract submission form at 

http://www.congrex.nl/10m10 

no later then Friday, December 18, 2009

[NASA PDS] MARS RECONNAISSANCE ORBITER DATA RELEASE 11

The Planetary Data System (PDS) is pleased to announce a new delivery 
of Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO) data for the CRISM, CTX, HiRISE,
MARCI, MCS, RSS, SHARAD, SPICE instruments.

In general, MRO Release 11 includes data collected February 9, 2008 
through May 8, 2009.

MRO raw radio science data for this release have not yet been 
delivered to PDS due to a hardware failure. The data are expected to 
be delivered and posted by Dec. 31, 2009.

The HiRISE release includes image data acquired August 6, 2009 to 
August 26, 2009 in the orbit range of 14,200 to 14,499.  In addition,
reprocessed RDR products have been released for much of the data 
acquired between December 20, 2008 and August 17, 2009.  These 
feature improved calibration and can be identified by the 
PRODUCT_VERSION_ID keyword which will have a value of 2.

Three digital terrain models are now available within the DTM 
directory of the HiRISE PDS volume.

A number of corrupted HiRISE EDR products have been reprocessed 
and released; a list of the observations can be found within the 
errata file on the HiRISE PDS volume.

JOB ANNOUNCEMENT: FACULTY POSITION IN PLANETARY ATMOSPHERES

The School of Earth and Space Exploration at Arizona State University 
seeks new faculty who wish to engage in collaborative, multi-
disciplinary studies of planetary atmospheres. A demonstrated track 
record in research, teaching and grantsmanship is preferred. 
Atmospheres of all planetary bodies are of interest, including those 
of Mars, Titan, gas giants, and hot Jupiter-like planets in extrasolar 
systems.  Areas of interest include: atmospheric dynamics at global, 
regional, or mesoscales, atmospheric state, composition, origin and 
evolution, and surface-atmosphere interactions.  These studies could be 
focused on numerical modeling, observations, data analysis, instrument 
design and development, or some combination of these approaches.  
Successful applicants will be expected to interact with the current and 
future SESE directions, including planetary surface processes and 
dynamics, astrobiology, climatology, and/or the formation and evolution 
of planets and planetary systems.

Applications should include: 1) a cover letter that includes a 
description of the applicant's research and teaching interests, 
2) a current CV, and 3) the names, addresses and telephone numbers of 
three references. Inquiries and applications must be addressed to:

Kip Hodges, Director
School of Earth and Space Exploration

and submitted electronically to: 

sesenewfac@asu.edu

Submissions in pdf format are preferred.

JOB ANNOUNCEMENT: FACULTY POSITION IN EXTRASOLAR PLANET STUDIES

The School of Earth and Space Exploration at Arizona State University 
seeks faculty who wish to engage in collaborative, multidisciplinary 
studies of the nature, formation, and evolution of extrasolar planets. 
Both observational and theoretical studies are of interest. Specific 
research areas might include but are not limited to: spectroscopy of 
planets and their host stars, novel techniques used to search for and 
characterize exoplanets, planetary interior models, and planetary 
dynamics. A demonstrated track record in research, teaching and 
grantsmanship is preferred.
 
Applications should include: 1) a cover letter that includes a 
description of the applicant's research and teaching interests,

JOB ANNOUNCEMENT: FACULTY POSITION IN PLANETARY SURFACE PROCESSES

The School of Earth and Space Exploration at Arizona State University 
seeks faculty who wish to engage in collaborative, multidisciplinary 
studies of planetary surface processes. A demonstrated track record in 
research, teaching and grantsmanship is preferred. Specifically, we 
seek applicants with interests in how the surfaces of rocky and ice-
rich objects are shaped by processes including tectonics, volcanism, 
impact cratering, and sedimentary processes. Such studies would benefit 
from new perspectives in planetary geomorphology, geochemistry, 
volcanology, hydrology, and/or structural geology, using planetary 
remote sensing, modeling, terrestrial analog investigations, or some 
combination of these approaches.

Applications should include: 1) a cover letter that includes a 
description of the applicant's research and teaching interests, 
2) a current CV, and 3) the names, addresses and telephone numbers of 
three references. Inquiries and applications must be addressed to:
