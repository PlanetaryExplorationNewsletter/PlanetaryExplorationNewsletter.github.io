PLANETARY SCIENCES DECADAL SURVEY CHAIR APPOINTED

The chairman of the National Research Council has approved the 
appointment of Steve Squyres of Cornell University to chair the 
planetary sciences decadal survey committee.  The appointment of 
Larry Soderblom of the U.S. Geological Survey to serve as the 
survey's vice-chair was also approved.  Additional information 
about the decadal survey can be found at www.nas.edu/ssb.

MARS DUST CYCLE WORKSHOP

NASA/Ames Research Center
September 15-17, 2009
Indication of Interest Due: May 1, 2009
Website: http://humbabe.arc.nasa.gov/MarsDustWorkshop/DustHome.html
Workshop convenor: Robert M. Haberle (NASA/Ames)  
Robert.M.Haberle@nasa.gov

The Martian climate system is characterized in terms of the seasonal  
cycles of dust, water, and CO2, which are coupled and driven by the  
general circulation. Recent workshops have focused on the water and  
CO2 cycles, but a workshop focused on the dust cycle, perhaps the  
most complex component of the climate system overall, has not been  
held since the post Viking data analysis programs of the 1980's.  
Given the enormous volume of data acquired since then, as well as the  
advances in modeling and laboratory methods, the time is right to  
hold a workshop focused on dust cycle. This workshop seeks to  
understand the global behavior of dust in the atmosphere by focusing  
on its lifting, transport, and deposition in the present climate 
regime.

SOLICITATION OF MANUSCRIPTS FOR GSA SPECIAL PAPER

Analogs for Planetary Exploration

A Special Paper on planetary analogs and exploration has recently 
been approved to begin the publication process by the Geological
Society of America. We are soliciting manuscripts that fall under
three main themes regarding analog studies as we prepare to return
to the Moon, Mars, and beyond: 1) field guides, 2) research, and
3) mission simulations.  This Special Paper is an avenue for articles
that might not fit into traditional research journals including
unpublished field guides to geologic analogs and reviews of analog
field tests and training for human and robotic exploration, past 
and present. Authors interested in contributing should send us a  
title, brief synopsis (3-5 sentences), list of authors, and contact
information for lead author.

April 30, 2009: Author commitments confirmed
Sept. 30, 2009: First drafts of manuscripts due
Summer/Fall 2010: Final publication

Please contact us with questions or for additional details.

PLANETARY SCIENCE JOURNAL CLUB

The Planetary Science Journal Club (PSJC) is a newly-formed
Google Group aimed at planetary scientists and students that
functions as an online journal club:

http://groups.google.com/group/psjc

We will discuss a paper about once a week, alternating between
Mars and non-Mars topics.  Note that weekly participation is
not required (in fact, I expect that most members will only
have time to read 1 or 2 papers a month).

Articles discussed so far include:

Mumma+ (2009) Methane on Mars
Head+ (2008) Volcanism on Mercury
Russell+ (2008) Martian Polar Avalanches
Turtle+ (2009) Lakes on Titan

Even non-members can read the discussion threads,
so feel free to check them out:

http://groups.google.com/group/psjc/topics

Hope you join the club!

POSTDOCTORAL SCHOLAR NORTHERN ARIZONA UNIVERSITY

The Department of Physics and Astronomy at Northern Arizona 
University (NAU) seeks an outstanding postdoctoral scholar to work 
with Professor David Trilling on studies of Near Earth Objects 
(NEOs). Professor Trilling leads a large Warm Spitzer program to 
observe 700 NEOs. The primary tasks for the successful candidate 
will be to help lead the daily operations of this project; 
participate in data analysis; and report scientific results. 
Additional tasks may include related ground-based observing and 
supervision of student research assistants. The successful candidate 
will also be encouraged to lead his/her independent projects. NAU 
has full competitive access to all University of Arizona Observatories
facilities (LBT, MMT, Magellan, etc.). Ample research and travel funds
are available.


The ideal candidate will have a PhD in an appropriate field and good 
organizational and interpersonal skills. The position is available 
immediately, and is expected to last for two years, with a third year
possible, depending on funding. NAU offers an excellent benefits 
package to postdocs. For more information and to apply, go to: 

http://hr.nau.edu/ (job #558009) 

submit a brief research statement, CV, and the names of three 
references.

Applications will be considered beginning April 10, 2009.

Inquiries to David.Trilling@nau.edu.
