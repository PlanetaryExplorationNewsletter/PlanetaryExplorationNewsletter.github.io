[NASA] HIGH-END COMPUTING FOR SMD-SPONSORED RESEARCH

If you have NASA Science Mission Directorate (SMD) funding and you 
want to use NASA High-End Computing (HEC) resources for your 
research, then you must request allocation for the HEC systems that 
you wish to use.

The NASA Science Mission Directorate (SMD) is currently accepting 
requests for HEC time on the NASA Advanced Supercomputing (NAS) 
facility at NASA Ames Research Center and for NASA Center for 
Computational Sciences (NCCS) resources at NASA Goddard Space Flight 
Center. Requests are solicited for FY10Q1 awards to begin November 1, 
2009, and expire October 31, 2010.  A committee of SMD program 
managers will consider requests submitted via e-Books to the SMD 
rolling submission call by the September 20, 2009, deadline.

http://www.hec.nasa.gov 

For help in determining which resource might handle your project's 
codes most effectively, contact

support@nccs.nasa.gov or support@nas.nasa.gov

For questions on the SMD HEC allocation process contact

[NASA] SBAG DECADAL WORKSHOP AT DPS - TIME CHANGE

October 7, Wednesday, 11:00-1:00 PM
Room: Vieques

This workshop will be to debate priorities for the decadal survey
in the area of small bodies. This is in support of the Primitive
Bodies Decadal Panel. SBAG organized seven community white papers, 
now submitted, that identified top-level science issues and mission 
priorities within the subdisciplines of Near-Earth Asteroids, 
Asteroids, Comets, Dwarf Planets, Small Satellites, Centaurs and 
Small Irregular TNOs, and Interplanetary Dust. The next task is to 
prioritize the science issues and the recommended future NASA 
missions across the entire primitive bodies field.

These white papers, in addition to more narrowly focused topical 
papers are available at

http://www.psi.edu/decadal

The workshop will commence with five minute presentations on each 
of the seven community white papers mentioned above, followed by 
an open discussion.

If you are interested in participating in the NASA Small Bodies 
Assessment Group, please go to
