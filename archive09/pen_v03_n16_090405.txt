POST-DOCTORAL RESEARCH ASSOCIATE ON THE CASSINI-HUYGENS MISSION

University College London's Mullard Space Science Laboratory
is seeking a postdoctoral Research Associate to work on Cassini data 
analysis within the Planetary Science Group.  MSSL is the UK's largest 
university-based space science research institution and is involved in 
many leading space research missions (http://www.mssl.ucl.ac.uk/). 

The post is concerned with the scientific analysis of data from the 
Electron Spectrometer, part of the Cassini Plasma Spectrometer.  
The successful candidate will join a team working on data analysis of 
physical processes at work in Saturn's rapidly rotating magnetosphere 
(sources, transport, reconnection, high latitude effects), in the 
magnetosphere's interactions with moons (particularly Titan, Enceladus 
and other icy satellites), and with neutral particles and dust (e.g. 
E-ring and main ring populations). Responsibilities involve the 
structure and dynamics of Saturn's magnetosphere, and/or its 
interactions with Titan and other bodies. 

PhD in physics or a closely-related field (ideally planetary or space 
plasma physics) required. Experience in particle or plasma data 
analysis an advantage.  Appointment will nominally commence 1 October 
2009, is funded until March 2010 with possible extension to 2012 and 
later. Salary will be on UCL salary Grade 7. Further information at  
http://www.mssl.ucl.ac.uk/jobs.
Closing date Friday, 1st May 2009

COMMUNITY LETTER FOR OUTER PLANET FLAGSHIP MISSION

The Europa Jupiter System Mission is first priority for the Outer 
Planet Flagship Missions and involves the NASA Jupiter Europa Orbiter, 
ESA Jupiter Ganymede Orbiter, and possibly other elements, such as a 
JAXA Magnetospheric Orbiter. In addition to Europa and Ganymede, 
substantial Jupiter system science will be conducted.

The science objectives were defined (http://opfm.jpl.nasa.gov/library/)
and the mission is in the next stage of development. Goals include 
strengthening the science return, encouraging planetary community 
involvement, and ensuring support by relevant space agencies. Workshops 
are planned to assist potential instrument providers for addressing 
radiation and planetary protection issues, with the first workshop 
July 15-17 at the Applied Physics Laboratory, Maryland. In addition, 
Jupiter-system sessions are planned for near-term meetings, such as 
the European Planetary Science Conference this fall in Potsdam. More 
broadly, next year marks the 400th anniversary of Galileo's discovery 
of Jupiter's moons, and special events could mark the occasion. Your 
ideas, help, and participation in related activities is encouraged.

On behalf of the Joint Science Definition Team, please contact 
Greeley@asu.edu <mailto:Greeley@asu.edu>  if you have ideas for 
activities and/or would like to get involved in some capacity.

[NASA] ANNOUNCEMENT OF OPPORTUNITY FOR NEW FRONTIERS 2009

Release Date:  April 20, 2009
Notice of Intent Due:  June 12, 2009
Proposals Due:  July 31, 2009

NASA expects to select up to three New Frontiers mission proposals for 
a 10 month Phase A study.  Following evaluation of Phase A reports, 
NASA expects to approve one New Frontiers mission to proceed into Phase 
B and subsequent mission phases.  Launch will occur no earlier than 
late CY 2016 and no later than CY 2018.  Proposed missions must address 
the science objectives of one of the eight mission concepts identified 
in the National Research Council's 2007 report, Opening New Frontiers 
in Space: Choices for the Next New Frontiers Announcement of 
Opportunity.

Participation is open to all categories of organizations (U.S. and 
non-U.S), including educational, industrial, and not-for-profit 
organizations, FFRDCs, University Affiliated Research Centers, NASA 
Centers, JPL, and other Government agencies.  Upon the release date, 
the full text of the AO and all appendices will be available 
electronically at http://nspires.nasaprs.com/. A preproposal conference 
will be held June 3, 2009, in the Washington, DC, area; see 
http://newfrontiers.larc.nasa.gov/ for details.

[NASA] PDS RELEASES TABLES OF MEAN MOTION RESONANCES OF SATURN'S MAIN
RINGS

Tables of mean motion resonances in the main rings of Saturn are 
available through the NASA Planetary Data System. The tables give 
resonance locations and the low order terms from the expansion of the 
disturbing function for resonances up to 4th order (2nd order for Pan 
and Daphnis). You can obtain more information and browse or download 
the tables at http://pds-rings.seti.org/resonance/.
