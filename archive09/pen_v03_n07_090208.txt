LATEST SARA LETTER OUT NOW

The latest "SARA letter" from the R&A lead of NASA's Science Mission
Directorate came out at the end of January. It includes links to how 
the upcoming big ROSES 2009 solicitation will differ from prior 
years, the latest grant stats reporting selection rates for program
elements, plots of the time that elapsed between submission and
selection for ROSES 2007, a summary of Greg Davidson's latest Science
News metric, and a list of all of the program officers and their
contact information. The Jan letter from SARA can be found at:

GOOGLE MAP - NOW WITH MARS

On Monday, Google, Inc., released Google Earth 5.0 (it is free), which
contains a Mars 3D mode.  My colleagues and I here at NASA Ames 
helped with getting the data into a format ready for Google.
 
The Ames press release is here:

INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON MARCO POLO AND OTHER SMALL BODY SAMPLE
RETURN MISSIONS

An  International Symposium on Marco Polo and other Small Body Sample
Return Missions will be held in Paris on May 18-20, 2009.
Marco Polo is a joint European-Japanese sample return mission to a
Near-Earth Object (NEO) studied within the ESA Cosmic Vision program.
The meeting is open to and welcomes members of all communities
interested  in small body sample return missions as they relate to
understanding Solar System origin and evolution.

For more information and registration (deadline March 15, 2009), see

NRC STUDY ON THE ROLE AND SCOPE OF MISSION-ENABLING ACTIVITIES IN 
NASA's SPACE AND EARTH SCIENCE MISSIONS

In response to a request from Congress, the Space Studies Board has 
organized a committee to conduct a study of mission-enabling 
activities in NASA's space and Earth sciences program. 
(Mission-enabling activities--which traditionally encompass much of 
NASA's research and analysis (R&A) programs--include support for 
theory, modeling, and data analysis; sub-orbital flights and 
complementary ground-based programs; and advanced mission and 
instrumentation concept studies.) The study will identify the 
appropriate roles for mission-enabling activities and metrics for 
assessing their effectiveness.  It also will evaluate how, from a 
strategic perspective, decisions should be made about balance between 
mission-related and mission-enabling elements of the overall program 
as well as balance between various elements within the mission-enabling
component. It is important to note that while the study will consider 
portfolio allocation principles and metrics from a strategic 
perspective, it will NOT address or propose specific funding levels. 
More information about the study committee and its charge is available
at:

http://www8.nationalacademies.org/cp/projectview.aspx?key=48965 

Individuals who wish to offer views or suggestions for the attention 
of the study committee should send them to the study director, 
Joseph Alexander, at jalexander@nas.edu.

REPORT ON A FLAGSHIP CLASS MISSION TO VENUS

The Venus Science and Technology Definition Team (STDT) is finalizing
its report on a Flagship class mission to Venus, which will be released
in April 2009.  With the support of the Venus Exploration and Analysis
Group (VEXAG), all interim publications and reports of the Venus STDT
are now available on the VEXAG web site at:

PLANETARY ATMOSPHERES: DYNAMICS, CHEMISTRY, CLIMATE, AND COUPLINGS

Session P05 at the 2009 Joint Assembly, 24-27 May 2009.
Toronto, Canada
Abstracts due: 4 March 2009

Convenors:

Observations and modelling are yielding increasing understanding of the
characteristics of the atmospheres of Venus, the Earth, and Mars. Each
planet's atmosphere is unique yet there are also commonalities. In
addition, the couplings and interactions amongst dynamics, chemistry,
and climate are increasingly being recognised and explored for each of
these planets. This session aims to bring together research on the
dynamics, chemistry, and climate of Venus, the Earth, and Mars to
compare and contrast the characteristics of these planetary atmospheres
and the couplings and interactions within each planet's atmosphere. We
invite papers that provide new information on (1) the dynamics,
chemistry, or climate of Venus or Mars, (2) comparisons amongst the
atmospheres of Venus, the Earth, and Mars, (3) the couplings amongst
dynamics, chemistry, and climate on Venus, the Earth, and Mars, and (4)
comparisons amongst past evolutionary epochs for Venus, the Earth, and 
Mars.
