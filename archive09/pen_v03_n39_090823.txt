PRIMITIVE BODIES COMMUNITY WHITE PAPAERS DEADLINE APPROACHING

The NASA Small Bodies Assessment Group has organized seven community 
white papers to provide community input to the planetary decadal survey
on the top-level science issues and mission priorities in the areas of 
Near-Earth Asteroids, Asteroids, Comets, Interplanetary Dust, Small 
Irregular Satellites, Centaurs and Small Irregular TNOs, and Dwarf 
Planets. 

Go to http://www.psi.edu/decadal to register and participate in these
papers and the discussion of prioritization across the white paper 
recommendations that will follow. 

The deadline for these community white papers is September 4.

FALL AGU SPECIAL SESSION: DEEP PLANETARY TRANSITION LAYER PROCESSES

Conveners: Jon Aurnou, Matthieu Dumberry & John Hernlund

Abstracts are due Sept. 3.

DI10: Boundary and Transition Layer Coupling Processes in Deep  
Planetary Interiors

The interface between the metallic, electrically-conducting 'core' and  
the electrically-insulating 'mantle' is often the dominant limiting  
boundary for thermal, mass, and momentum transport in a planet's  
interior. For the terrestrial planets, this corresponds to the  
seismically sharp core-mantle boundary. For the outer planets such an  
interface is not as well understood and may be more diffuse. In  
Jupiter and Saturn, the interface represents a transition from the  
deep atmosphere (also called the molecular envelope) to the liquid  
metallic core. In Uranus and Neptune, the interface is the transition  
between the deep atmosphere and a conducting layer of ionic liquid  
with an ice-rich composition.  Because important boundary layers lie  
both above and below, these interfaces are critical for understanding  
a planet's thermal, chemical, magnetic and rotational state, as as 
its  evolutionary path to that state.  In this session, we welcome  
contributions on coupling processes across core-mantle interfaces of  
all kinds, and on the ways in which these processes affect the  
planet's observable properties.

NEW HORIZONS KBO SEARCH - DPS MEETING WORKSHOP

Following its July 2015 Pluto encounter, the New Horizons (NH)
spacecraft will continue into the Kuiper Belt, and one or more KBOs
may be targeted for close flybys.  There are probably KBOs brighter
than magnitude 27 that are accessible by the spacecraft, but these
have yet to be discovered.  The optimum time for a search for flyby
targets for NH is the period 2011-2014, when the search area is
relatively small and is beginning to emerge from the Milky
Way. Large-aperture telescopes, wide-field imagers, and software
capable of extracting moving objects from crowded starfields will be
required.

The New Horizons project is soliciting help for this search, and can
provide financial support for selected search teams.  NH science team
participation of search team PIs in the KBO encounter(s) is also a
possibility.  There will be a workshop at the 2009 DPS meeting (time
and place TBD), which will include discussion of the search region,
search depth required, possible search and data analysis strategies,
results of preliminary searches, and potential mechanisms for forming
and funding search teams.

If you are interested in the DPS workshop or the search, please
contact John Spencer, lastname@boulder.swri.edu

JOB ANNOUNCEMENT - SCHOOL POSTDOCTORAL FELLOWSHIP

See http://jobs.anu.edu.au/PositionDetail.aspx?p=791

This Fellowship aims to attract candidates of the highest ability,
irrespective of field, to the physics program in the Australian 
National University's College of Physical Sciences.  The physics 
program at ANU includes research programs in planetary atmospheric 
chemistry, planetary astronomy, and laboratory spectroscopy. 
Applications are open to candidates who are within five years of the 
date of award of their PhD. Candidates who are in the final stage of 
their PhD must have been awarded their degree by the time of commencing 
their appointment.

Candidates will be assessed on their research potential and track 
record relative to opportunity, taking into account their background 
in either theory or experiment. The Fellowship is for two years in any 
of the physics research areas within the College of Physical Sciences:

http://physics.anu.edu.au/ 

or 

http://www.anu.edu.au/Physics/new/index.php.

Fellowship enquiries: Professor Kenneth Baldwin
Planetary research enquiries: Professor Brenton Lewis, Dr Stephen
Gibson, or Dr Frank Mills

Deadline for application 31 August 2009.

PLANETARY SCIENCE SLIDES AND ILLUSTRATIONS

Are you looking for some great slides or illustrations to use in your 
classes this term? The Planetary Science Research Discoveries website 
has powerpoint slides for 20 of its latest articles covering 
fundamental topics in planetary science. The slides are annotated with 
captions and notes, and are linked to PSRD articles that provide the 
full context, additional graphics, and references.

Web link: http://www.psrd.hawaii.edu/Archive/Archive-PSRDpresents.html

In addition, many college instructors have recommended their students 
begin with PSRD when researching topics for term papers or other 
research projects. All 130+ articles are available in the archive at 

http://www.psrd.hawaii.edu/Archive/
