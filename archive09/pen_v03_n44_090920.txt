SMALL MISSIONS TO THE MOON - FIRST JOINT USA/UK/CANADA WORKSHOP ON 
LUNAR SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING

September 21-22, 2009
Toronto, Canada

This workshop will be to debate, discuss and plan science and 
engineering priorities in support of USA/UK/Canada joint small missions 
to the moon proposed by scientists from the three countries. PIs from 
University of Hawaii, University of Surrey and York University formed 
and organized a mission white paper that identifies high-level science 
issues, mission priorities and engineering challenges for small 
missions to the moon. The first workshop will help with the next task 
of prioritizing the science issues and refining the mission overview 
and system design. The science and engineering linkage between Moon 
and Mars will also be debated and discussed. The workshop will commence 
with three presentations on the white paper mentioned above, followed 
by several long question and discussion periods. Details about the 
workshop can be found at:

[NASA] STAND ALONE MISSIONS OF OPPORTUNITY NOTICE (SALMON) - PROPOSAL 
DUE DATE CHANGE

NASA Announcement of Opportunity NNH08ZDA009O, "Stand Alone Missions 
of Opportunity Notice (SALMON)," is amended to establish a new 
proposal due date for proposals submitted in response to Program 
Element Appendix (PEA) H3: Small Complete Missions of Opportunity in 
Astrobiology and Fundamental Space Biology. This PEA has been 
extensively modified from the previously released version and the new 
version replaces the old version in its entirety.

On or about September 30, 2009, Amendment No. 3 to the NASA 
Announcement of Opportunity "Stand Alone Missions of Opportunity 
Notice (SALMON)" (NNH08ZDA009O) will be posted on the NASA research 
opportunity homepage at 

http://nspires.nasaprs.com/

NORTHERN ARIZONA UNIVERSITY DEPARTMENT OF PHYSICS AND ASTRONOMY 
POSTDOCTORAL OPPORTUNITY

The Department of Physics and Astronomy at Northern Arizona University
(NAU) seeks an outstanding postdoctoral scholar to work with Professor
David Trilling in studies of small bodies in the Solar System (in
particular of the Kuiper Belt.) Candidates should have a Ph.D. in
astronomy, physics, planetary science, or related field. Desired skills
include familiarity with optical and/or infrared observations, large
observational datasets, and/or the Kuiper Belt and Kuiper Belt Objects.
The successful candidate will work on projects with Professor Trilling 
and will also lead independent research projects. NAU has full 
competitive access to all University of Arizona Observatories 
facilities, including the 6.5-meter MMT and Magellan telescopes, the
2x8.4-meter LBT telescopes, and numerous smaller telescopes.

The appointment is expected to be two years with a third year possible.
NAU offers an excellent benefits package to postdoctoral scholars.
Flagstaff is a beautiful town of 60,000 people nestled at the base of
the San Francisco Peaks in northern Arizona and features four seasons 
of outdoor activities. The Department of Physics and Astronomy is a 
small, friendly group.

To apply, please visit the NAU HR web page

WORKSHOP AT DPS - WOMEN IN ASTRONOMY: PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT

October 7, 2009
Wednesday, **** 12:30-2:00 PM ****
Room: Culebra

The purpose of this workshop is to solicit ideas and information from  
the community in preparation for a proposal to the DPS Committee for  
the Formation of a Professional Development. Such a  
committee might tackle topics like applying for postdocs, tenure-track  
jobs, how to give talks, write proposals, etc. The workshop program  
will include a review of online resources for professional development  
and a brain storming session regarding the needs of the community.

All are welcome, but pre-registration is required for this event due  
to space limitations.  Lunch will be provided. Please contact
