EDITORIAL: NASA PLANETARY MISSION DATA ANALYSIS PROGRAM

Mark V. Sykes
Planetary Science Institute

This is a very valuable addition to NASA's research and data analysis 
programs, filling many gaps. I organized the review panel last cycle 
and was surprised that the vast majority of colleagues I called had no 
knowledge of the program. I encourage you to go to NSPIRES and look it 
up in the ROSES09 announcement. Proposals are due August 14.

PMDAP supports the analysis of planetary data (not covered by another 
DAP) from all past planetary and also non-planetary missions (e.g., 
Spitzer, FUSE, etc.).

This is the program for analysing Mercury MESSENGER data. I would like 
to encourage planetary geologists who have been focusing on Mars and 
perhaps recently extended their science to the Moon through the LASER 
program to be aware of this opportunity.

PMDAP funds proposals for archiving data collections into PDS that are 
considered "of significance to solar system science." This may include 
decades of NASA-supported ground-based observations of solar system 
objects sitting on your bookshelves. It may include restoration of old 
mission data into a useable format, followed by archiving.

Approximately 15-20 new awards (up to 4 years, ~ 140-187K/year) are 
anticipated.

SEEKING NOMINATIONS FOR COSPAR AWARDS AND MEDALS

The Committee on Space Research (COSPAR) is seeking nominees for 
various awards and medals which recognize the outstanding achievements 
of space scientists throughout the world.  Details of the awards, past 
recipients, nomination forms and instructions can be found at 

http://cosparhq.cnes.fr/Awards/awards.htm  

Awards will be presented at the 38th COSPAR Scientific Assembly to be 
held in Bremen, Germany, July 18-25, 2010. Completed nominations forms 
must be received by the COSPAR Secretariat in Paris no later than 
30 November, 2009.

JULY DECADAL SURVEY MEETING WEBCASTING

The National Research Council's Planetary Science Decadal Survey will 
webcast all of the open sessions during the 6-8 July meeting of its 
Steering Group.  The webcast will be available at the following URL:  

http://nasa-nai.acrobat.com/psdecadal/  

Audio can be accessed via a telephone call to 1-866-878-9452, passcode 
9387576. The times of the open sessions is available on the meeting 
agenda posted on the decadal survey's website at 

http://www7.nationalacademies.org/ssb
/planetary_decadal_steering_agenda1.pdf  

[Editor note: URL is wrapped]

Please note that the agenda is subject to change.  The decadal survey 
offers its sincere thanks to the NASA Astrobiology Institute for the 
technical support to make this community service possible.

SIMPLE EFFECTIVE EDUCATION AND DISSEMINATION (SEED) GRANTS FOR 
ASTRONOMY RESEARCHERS AVAILABLE FOR 2009 FROM THE ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY
OF THE PACIFIC

Thanks to the support of the Planck and Herschel Missions, the 
Astronomical Society of the Pacific is offering SEED Grants for 2009 
to active researchers in astronomy, astrophysics, or space science to 
engage in public outreach, K-14 formal education, or informal education 
programs or activities.

Maximum grants are $2,500; funds may be used to purchase equipment 
related to the proposed EPO activity, or to defray expenses associated 
with carrying out the activity. Given the nature of the Planck and 
Herschel Missions, SEED Grant proposals involving cosmology, galaxy 
studies, solar system investigations, and space science will be given 
special consideration.

Proposal submission deadline is July 31, 2009, with announcement of
awards by September 15, 2009.
