[NASA] PLANETARY SCIENCE SUMMER SCHOOL APPLICATIONS

NASA is accepting applications from science and engineering post-docs,
recent PhDs, and doctoral students for its 21st Annual Planetary 
Science Summer School, which will hold two separate sessions this 
summer (20-24 July and 3-7 August) at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory 
in Pasadena, Calif. During the program, student teams will carry out 
the equivalent of an early mission concept study, prepare a proposal 
authorization review presentation, present it to a review board, and 
receive feedback. At the end of the week, students will have a clearer 
understanding of the life cycle of a space mission; relationships 
between mission design, cost, and schedule; and the tradeoffs necessary
to stay within cost and schedule while preserving the quality of 
science. Applications are due 1 May 2009. Partial financial support 
is available for a limited number of individuals. Further information 
is available at:

[NASA PDS] RELEASE 8 OF MARS RECONNAISSANCE ORBITER (MRO) DATA

The Planetary Data System (PDS) is pleased to announce Release 8
of Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO) data for the following 
instruments: CRISM, CTX, HiRISE, MARCI, MCS, RSS, SHARAD and SPICE.  
In general, MRO Release 8 includes data collected May 9, 2008 through 
August 8, 2008.

The HiRISE Operations Center has released HiRISE image data acquired
over the time period spanning October 14, 2008 to January 16, 2009
in the MRO orbit range of 10,400 to 11,599.  This release contains
1.8 Terabytes of image products derived from 642 observations made
by the HiRISE camera during this period.

In addition, nearly 500 stereo anaglyph products have been released,
bringing HIRISE analglyph production up to date with the currently
released set of stereo pairs.

INVITATION TO CONTRIBUTE TO A SPECIAL ISSUE OF ICARUS DEVOTED TO THE 
PLANET MERCURY

The Editors of Icarus and the MESSENGER Science Team invite 
contributions to a special issue devoted to the planet Mercury.  The 
MESSENGER team will be contributing a set of papers reporting results 
from the spacecraft's first two flybys of Mercury in January and 
October 2008, as well as on models that account for those observations.
The special issue is also open to other papers reporting new results on
Mercury science.  These could be papers analyzing observations from the
Mariner 10 or MESSENGER flybys, reporting on new models, or presenting 
appropriate ground-based or laboratory measurements.  The submission 
deadline for all papers in the special issue is 31 May 2009.

To assist in planning for the editorial review of papers for the 
special issue, contributors from outside the MESSENGER team are asked 
to send a brief letter of intent by the end of April to the Icarus 
editorial office: icarus@astro.cornell.edu.

CALL FOR ABSTRACTS

On behalf of the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter Project, the Arizona 
State University School of Earth of Space Exploration is hosting the 
Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter Science Targeting Meeting on June 9 to 11,
2009.  A goal of this meeting is to foster understanding of LRO 
capabilities and the mission planning processes necessary for 
high-resolution targeting of lunar features by the LRO Narrow Angle 
Cameras, the Mini-RF synthetic aperture radar, and Diviner Lunar 
Radiometer Experiment. Another goal is to solicit ideas from the lunar 
science community for LRO targeting of specific types of features and 
focused science themes. The meeting will feature presentations and 
discussion of 6 lunar research themes that have application to the 
capabilities of LRO. The primary product of this meeting will be a 
prioritized list of targets including rationale and LRO acquisition 
parameters.

Meeting information can be found here:

http://ser.sese.asu.edu/LSM/index.php

Abstracts are welcome for 6 science themes related to the exploration
of the Moon by the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter mission, including 
lunar regolith, volcanism, crustal composition, impact cratering, 
volatiles, and habitation and resources.

Abstracts should be submitted electronically by April 17, 2009 at 
5:00 p.m. U.S. CDT. Templates and instructions can be found here:
