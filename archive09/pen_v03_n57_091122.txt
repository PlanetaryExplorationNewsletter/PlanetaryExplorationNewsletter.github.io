ABSCICON CALL FOR ABSTRACTS: WHERE TO SEARCH FOR LIFE ON MARS

Dear Colleagues,

You are cordially invited to submit a contribution to our session at 
The Astrobiology Science Conference (AbSciCon) 2010:

Where Should We Go On Mars to Seek Signs of Life: or Where are the 
Most Promising Landing Sites?

The Mars Exploration Program Analysis Group (MEPAG) has recently 
adopted "Seek the Signs of Life" as its next broad strategy.  Landed 
missions that could fly within the decade are being considered to 
address this strategy.  What geologic environments would best 
preserve evidence of ancient life?  How can we recognize these 
environments based on current and expected data from Mars?

We welcome contributions relating to Mars science as well as 
terrestrial analog studies.

Meeting date and location: April 26-29, 2010, at the South Shore 
Harbour Resort and Conference Center in League City, Texas.

Abstract Deadline: 5:00 p.m. (CST) Thursday, December 3, 2009

Carl Allen and Abby Allwood

JOB ANNOUNCEMENT:  FACULTY POSITION IN PLANETARY ATMOSPHERES

The School of Earth and Space Exploration at Arizona State University 
seeks new faculty who wish to engage in collaborative, multi-
disciplinary studies of planetary atmospheres. A demonstrated track 
record in research, teaching and grantsmanship is preferred. 
Atmospheres of all planetary bodies are of interest, including those 
of Mars, Titan, gas giants, and hot Jupiter-like planets in extrasolar 
systems.  Areas of interest include: atmospheric dynamics at global, 
regional, or mesoscales, atmospheric state, composition, origin and 
evolution, and surface-atmosphere interactions.  These studies could be 
focused on numerical modeling, observations, data analysis, instrument 
design and development, or some combination of these approaches.  
Successful applicants will be expected to interact with the current and 
future SESE directions, including planetary surface processes and 
dynamics, astrobiology, climatology, and/or the formation and evolution 
of planets and planetary systems.

Applications should include: 1) a cover letter that includes a 
description of the applicant's research and teaching interests, 
2) a current CV, and 3) the names, addresses and telephone numbers of 
three references. Inquiries and applications must be addressed to:

Kip Hodges, Director
School of Earth and Space Exploration

and submitted electronically to: 

sesenewfac@asu.edu

Submissions in pdf format are preferred.

JOB ANNOUNCEMENT:  FACULTY POSITION IN EXTRASOLAR PLANET STUDIES

The School of Earth and Space Exploration at Arizona State University 
seeks faculty who wish to engage in collaborative, multidisciplinary 
studies of the nature, formation, and evolution of extrasolar planets. 
Both observational and theoretical studies are of interest. Specific 
research areas might include but are not limited to: spectroscopy of 
planets and their host stars, novel techniques used to search for and 
characterize exoplanets, planetary interior models, and planetary 
dynamics. A demonstrated track record in research, teaching and 
grantsmanship is preferred.
 
Applications should include: 1) a cover letter that includes a 
description of the applicant's research and teaching interests, 
2) a current CV, and 3) the names, addresses and telephone numbers of 
three references. Inquiries and applications must be addressed to:

JOB ANNOUNCEMENT:  FACULTY POSITION IN PLANETARY SURFACE PROCESSES

The School of Earth and Space Exploration at Arizona State University 
seeks faculty who wish to engage in collaborative, multidisciplinary 
studies of planetary surface processes. A demonstrated track record in 
research, teaching and grantsmanship is preferred. Specifically, we 
seek applicants with interests in how the surfaces of rocky and ice-
rich objects are shaped by processes including tectonics, volcanism, 
impact cratering, and sedimentary processes. Such studies would benefit 
from new perspectives in planetary geomorphology, geochemistry, 
volcanology, hydrology, and/or structural geology, using planetary 
remote sensing, modeling, terrestrial analog investigations, or some 
combination of these approaches.

Applications should include: 1) a cover letter that includes a 
description of the applicant's research and teaching interests, 
2) a current CV, and 3) the names, addresses and telephone numbers of 
three references. Inquiries and applications must be addressed to:

Kip Hodges, Director
School of Earth and Space Exploration
