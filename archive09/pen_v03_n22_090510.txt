PLANETARY PHOTOGRAMMETRY GUEST FACILITY AT THE USGS IN FLAGSTAFF

NASA and the US Geological Survey have established a Planetary 
Photogrammetry Guest Facility at the USGS in Flagstaff, Arizona.
This is a specialized computer workstation of the same type
used by the USGS for stereo topographic mapping of the Moon and
planets that will be available up to 50% of the time for qualified
researchers to use to make products ranging from simple spot height
measurements to fully edited digital topographic models (DTMs) from a 
wide variety of stereo images.  USGS staff will provide training and
supervision, but travel expenses are the responsibility of the selected
investigator.  To apply, send a short (1 page) informal application to
rkirk@usgs.gov.  The two key pieces of information required are the
research goals (to allow us to evaluate whether images to achieve these
goals are available) and the researcher's schedule of availability for
group training and subsequent use of the facility.  

Applications for the current fiscal year must be transmitted by 
31 May 2009. Applications received after that date will be considered
for FY 2010.

For more information about the capabilities of the stereo workstation
and the application process, see the 2009 LPSC abstract:

PDS IMAGING NODE - CASSINI ISS CALIBRATION UPDATE

Cassini Imaging Science Subsystem (ISS) has delivered a new version 
(Version  2.0) of their calibration software to the Planetary Data 
System Imaging Node.  The new version of  volume (COISS_0011) contains
both the CISSCAL IDL software package and associated calibration 
support files.  Of particular interest is the update to the absolute 
flux calibration, and the addition of a  command-line mode enabling 
image calibration without the CISSCAL graphical interface. The new 
version also provides an updated CISSCAL User Guide.  A full list of 
software modifications is given in the CISSCAL aareadme.txt file. For 
detailed instructions, see the updated users manual in the COISS_0011 
archive 'document' directory.  This volume is available on the PDS 
Imaging Node website:

ACCESSING LEVEL-4 ARCHIVAL HRSC IMAGES-DTMs VIA HRSCVIEW WEBSITE

Level-4 archival HRSC images and digital terrain models (DTMs) are 
freely available from the HRSCview website at the Free University
Berlin. Go to this URL:

http://hrscview.fu-berlin.de/cgi-bin/ion-p?page=entry.ion

Use the image search function on the main page to determine which 
orbits' data cover your region of interest. Then, select "Direct data 
access - Level 4" on the main page, and you will be taken to a page of 
folders by orbit number to download the appropriate images and DTMs.

NEW WEBSITE FOR MARS EXPRESS SRC MOSAICS

A new web page has been created at Arizona State University to access 
and download the Mars Express Super Resolution Camera (SRC) mosaics 
produced during the mission, in both VICAR and TIFF formats. A Google
based map shows the locations of the 339 mosaics produced thus far. To
access these images go to this URL:
