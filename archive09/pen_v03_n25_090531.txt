[NASA] EUROPA JUPITER SYSTEM MISSION (EJSM) INSTRUMENT WORKSHOP

Date: July 15-17, 2009 
Location: Applied Physics Laboratory, Laurel, Maryland 
URL: http://opfm.jpl.nasa.gov/InstrumentWorkshop/
 
Workshop topics include EJSM status, plans for instrument selection, 
model payloads, and technical challenges facing instrument providers 
(in particular the radiation environment) for both JEO and JGO. Some of 
the technical discussions will be specific to JEO but would applicable 
the JGO flight element as well. In addition, programmatic topics such 
as schedules and the AOs will be discussed.
 
Participants are encouraged to arrive prepared by reviewing the on-line 
tutorials from 2008 workshop and the on-line documents relating to 
radiation related activities which can both be accessed through 
http://opfm.jpl.nasa.gov/InstrumentWorkshop/.
 
Potential European and U.S. instrument providers who are interested 
in presenting instrument or synergistic science posters during the 
workshop must submit an abstract by the June 12 (after this date please 
contact the EJSM  Workshop Secretariat at 
ejsm.workshop@list.jpl.nasa.gov). Vendors with specific radiation 
and/or planetary protection capabilities will have the opportunity to 
provide a two page synopsis of their capabilities that will be 
published as part of the workshop, to provide a poster or display booth 
for a Radiation Capability session and will be present at the workshop 
for informal discussions.
