Subject: Lead Astrobiology Civil Servant position now available
 
The Planetary Science Division is now advertizing for the senior 
Program Scientist for Astrobiology. In general, this civil servant will 
oversee the science content and execution of the Astrobiology Program. 
A detailed description of the position and how to apply for this 
opportunity can be found on 

http://www.usajobs.gov/ 

with a announcement number (or search number): HQ09B0156. This position 
opened on July 10 and will close August 10, 2009. I encourage anyone

RSVP FOR MEPAG #21

Dear Colleagues:

This is a special request to all who are planning to attend MEPAG #21 
on July 29-30, 2009, at Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island, 
USA. In order for us to adequately plan for refreshments without 
overspending, please RSVP to me as soon as possible if you have not 
already done so.  This also allows for preparation of preprinted 
badges.

I look forward to your prompt responses.

Thank you,

SECOND ANNOUNCEMENT AND CALL FOR PAPERS FOR THE JOINT ESA-ASI WORKSHOP
ON METHANE ON MARS: CURRENT OBSERVATIONS, INTERPRETATION AND FUTURE
PLANS

This workshop will be held on 25-27 November 2009, at ESA/ESRIN in 
Frascati, Italy.

Methane has been detected in the Martian atmosphere both by 
ground-based telescopes and from space. This discovery indicates that 
the planet is either biologically or geologically active. The goal of 
the workshop is to review the available measurements, the potential 
reservoirs and release mechanisms of Methane and its circulation in 
the atmosphere, and to discuss the origin and sources of this 
constituent.

Abstract submission: A template is available on the web page. Deadline: 
1st September 2009

INITIAL ANNOUNCEMENT OF A WORKSHOP  -  
NIX AND HYDRA : FIVE YEARS AFTER DISCOVERY

Date: May 11-12, 2010
Location: Space Telescope Science Institute, Baltimore, MD

This workshop is planned to discuss our current understanding of
Pluto's two small satellites, Nix and Hydra, 5 years after their
discovery, as a part of New Horizons Pluto system encounter planning. 
The workshop will also focus on Nix and Hydra in the context of Pluto
formation, KBO analog bodies, and the general topic of KBO satellites.
Other topics to be covered include: interrelationships among the 
objects in the Pluto quadruple system, dynamical considerations, the 
physical properties of Nix and Hydra, their origin and evolution, the 
implications for other KBOs, how Nix and Hydra compare to other moons 
in the solar system, and the plans and expected datasets resulting 
from Nix and Hydra investigations by the New Horizons mission. Most of 
the presentations will be invited, but there will also be an 
opportunity to present contributed papers.

Attendance will be limited to ~50 people. If you are interested in 
participating, please send an email to Hal Weaver 
(hal.weaver@jhuapl.edu), and you will receive future mailings.

ORGANIZATIONAL MEETING OF THE LUNAR CRATER CONSORTIUM

The organizational meeting of the Lunar Crater Consortium will be held 
on September 28, 2009, at the US Geological Survey in Flagstaff, AZ.  
All researchers interested in lunar impact craters and the cratering 
process are invited to attend.  More information can be obtained at 
http://www.lunarcraterconsortium.nau.edu/ or by contacting 
Nadine Barlow at Nadine.Barlow@nau.edu.

ESA POSTDOCTORAL FELLOWSHIPS IN SPACE SCIENCE

The European Space Agency awards several postdoctoral fellowships each
year. The aim of these fellowships is to provide young scientists, 
holding a PhD or the equivalent degree, with the means of performing 
space science research in fields related to the ESA Science Programme. 
Areas of research include planetary science, astronomy and 
astrophysics, solar and solar-terrestrial science, plasma physics and 
fundamental physics. The fellowships have a duration of two years and 
are tenable at the European Space Research and Technology Centre 
(ESTEC) in Noordwijk, Netherlands, or at the European Space Astronomy 
Centre (ESAC) in Villafranca del Castillo, near Madrid, Spain.

Applications are now solicited for fellowships in space science to 
begin in the summer or fall of 2010. Preference will be given to 
applications submitted by candidates within five years of receiving 
their PhD.  Candidates not holding a PhD yet are encouraged to apply, 
but they must provide evidence of receiving their degree before starting 
the fellowship.

The deadline for applications is 1 October 2009.

More information on the programme, eligibility requirements and 
application can be found at http://www.rssd.esa.int/fellowship

For additional information contact Dr. Guido De Marchi at 
fellowship@rssd.esa.int
