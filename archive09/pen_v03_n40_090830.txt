RESEARCH OPPORTUNITIES AT THE INSTITUTE FOR ROCK MAGNETISM (U. OF
MINNESOTA)

The Institute for Rock Magnetism (IRM) is one of 15 national multiuser
facilities in the Earth Sciences supported by NSF

http://www.nsf.gov/geo/ear/if/guidelines2008.pdf

to provide advanced laboratory instrumentation to the geoscience
research and education communities.  Research at the IRM ranges from
fundamental investigations of the physics of fine-particle magnetism,
to applied studies using the magnetic characteristics of rocks and
sediments to investigate a wide variety of planetary and surficial
Earth processes.  We provide access and support for visiting
scientists in three categories, for which we invite applications:

(1) Visiting Research Fellows
(2) U.S. Student Fellows
(3) Long-Core (U-Channel) Magnetometer Fellows.

Complete details are available at www.irm.umn.edu.  Applications are
due October 30 for visits during the period from January 1 through
June 30, 2010, and will be reviewed by IRM staff and members of our
external Review and Advisory Committee (RAC).

AGU SESSION: PLANETARY CORES AND SUBSURFACE OCEANS DYNAMICS

Session p07: "Planetary Cores and Subsurface Oceans Dynamics Driven 
by Mechanical Forcings"

Summary: During the last few decades, more and more attention has 
been given to planetary liquid cores and Icy moons subsurface oceans 
dynamics driven by mechanical forcings; i.e. precession, libration, 
nutation and tides. Understanding the flow and dissipation resulting 
from these forcings is key to derive accurate models of energy budget,
thermal history and magnetic field generation of planets and Icy 
moons. In the present session, we encourage all contributions on 
planetary cores and subsurface ocean dynamics driven by mechanical 
forcings, including laboratory experiments, numerical simulations 
and astronomical observations.

AGU SESSION: VOLCANO-TECTONICS ON EARTH AND OTHER PLANETS

Dear colleagues,

We are pleased to announce the provisional titles and authors of
invited contributions to the 2009 AGU session "V12: Volcano-Tectonics:
New Insights from Earth and Other Planets":

(1) "The role played by lithospheric flexure in the structural
evolution of large volcanic edifices on the terrestrial planets" - Pat
McGovern (Lunar and Planetary Institute, Houston, USA)

(2) "The thick and thin of magma in volcano-tectonics" - Benjamin van
Wyk de Vries (Universite Blaise-Pascal, Clermont-Ferrand, France).

(3) "Identification of volcanic landforms and processes on Earth and
Mars using geospatial analyses" - Christopher Hamilton and Sarah
Fagents (Hawaii Institute of Geophysics and Planetology, Honolulu,
USA)

(4) "Magmatic activity on super-Earths: What do we expect to see?" -
Edwin Kite (University of California, Berkeley, USA).

We would also like to take this opportunity to further encourage your
own participation in the V12 session at the Fall Meeting (December
14th - 18th). The fast-approaching Deadline for Abstract Submission is
Thursday, September 3rd.

We look forward to seeing you in San Francisco,

E. Canon-Tapia, E. Herrero-Bervera, E. Holohan & M. Kervyn 
(Co-conveners)

P.S. Please again accept our apologies for any multiple posts.

AGU SESSION: MINERALOGY OF THE LUNAR CRUST

We would like to invite the planetary community to the Fall AGU Special
Session P03:

MINERALOGY OF THE LUNAR CRUST: RESULTS FROM THE MOON MINERALOGY MAPPER

The Moon Mineralogy Mapper (M3) is a NASA supported guest instrument on
India's first mission to the Moon, Chandrayaan-1, which launched on
October 22, 2008. M3 is a state-of-the-art imaging spectrometer that is
designed to characterize the mineralogy of the lunar surface at high
spatial and spectral resolution. By mapping the Moon's composition at
high resolution, geologic processes active on its surface through space
and time are identified and placed in geologic context. To date, M3 has
measured >60% of the lunar surface at 140 m/pixel, returning spectra of
unprecedented quality and detail. At the Fall 2009 AGU, new science
results will be presented for the first time to the geoscience
community. The new results from M3 play a major role in the new era of
science and international exploration of the Moon.

[NASA] SMALL BODIES ASSESSMENT GROUP DPS WORKSHOP ON DECADAL 
PRIORITIES

October 7, Wednesday, 12:30-2:00 PM

In support of the Primitive Bodies Decadal Panel, the SBAG organized
seven white papers spanning the subjects covered by that panel. These
papers were submitted on September 4 and will be available at

http://www.lpi.usra.edu/sbag/ 

Each paper identified top-level science issues and mission priorities
within the subdisciplines of Near-Earth Asteroids, Asteroids, Comets,
Dwarf Planets, Small Satellites, Centaurs and Small Irregular TNOs,
and Interplanetary Dust. The next task is to prioritize the science
issues and the recommended future NASA missions across the entire
primitive bodies field, and that will be the primary focus of the 
DPS workshop.

The workshop will commence with five minute presentations on each of 
the seven community white papers mentioned above, followed by an 
open discussion.

If you are interested in joining the above white papers, please go to:
