[NASA] TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPMENT FOR EXOPLANET MISSIONS

This amendment establishes a new program element in Appendix D.11
entitled "Technology Development for Exoplanet Missions." This new
program element solicits proposals to develop specific technologies
(TRL 4-6) that feed into key exoplanet exploration measurement
techniques.  The measurement techniques upon which future Exoplanet
Exploration Program missions are likely to be based include
astrometry, coronagraphy, interferometry, and precision photometry.

Notices of Intent to propose are due June 30, 2009, and proposals are
due August 28, 2009. An informational workshop describing available
ExEP testbed capabilities and providing guidance for developing
robust development milestones will be held July 8, 2009.  Workshop
information will be posted on the web at:

http://exep.jpl.nasa.gov

On or about June 1, 2009, this Amendment to the NASA Research
Announcement "Research Opportunities in Space and Earth Sciences
(ROSES) 2009" (NNH09ZDA001N) will be posted on the NASA research
opportunity homepage at:

http://nspires.nasaprs.com/ 

(select "Solicitations" then "Open Solicitations" then 
"NNH09ZDA001N").

SUBMIT SESSION FOR MRP AT AGU FALL MEETING  

Dear Colleagues,

Sorry for multiple postings. The deadline for proposing special 
sessions for the AGU Fall meeting 2009 is rapidly approaching. On 
behalf of the Mineral and Rock Physics Division of AGU, I would like
to kindly encourage you to propose special sessions in our division
for the meeting. Any contribution to mineralogy, crystallography,
mineral spectroscopy, planetary mineralogy, mineral surfaces, 
physical properties, high-pressure mineralogy, environmental 
mineralogy, theory and experiment, etc. and any interdisciplinary 
and multidisciplinary topics involving mineralogy and rock physics 
are welcome. Since always, the special sessions at AGU offer an 
excellent working and communication environment. Please help us show
a strong and dynamic division of Mineral and Rock Physics of AGU!

With my best wishes,
Razvan Caracas
MRP Program officer

ASTRONOMY EDUCATION REVIEW

2009 Contents and Invitation to Publish
-----------------------------------------------------------

Astronomy Education Review (AER), the web-based journal/magazine about
astronomy education and outreach, has published the first part of its
Volume 8 (the first under the aegis of the American Astronomical 
Society) and we invite you to take a look at:

http://aer.aip.org

The current table of contents includes the following articles of 
particular interest to planetary scientists:

Survey of K-12 Science Teachers' Educational Product Needs from
Planetary Scientists

Bill Gates' Great-Great-Granddaughter's Honeymoon: A (Solar System)
Astronomy Activity for Several Different Age Groups

AER actively solicits interesting papers and articles on all aspects
of astronomy and space science education and outreach. In addition
to research reports, we also welcome brief papers on innovative
approaches, resource guides, dissertation abstracts, substantive
op-ed pieces, and announcements of opportunities. All papers
are refereed, and a set of guidelines for contributing to AER
is available at: 

http://aer.aip.org

Manuscripts and questions can be directed to: aer@aas.org.

You can register on the site for quarterly updates.
