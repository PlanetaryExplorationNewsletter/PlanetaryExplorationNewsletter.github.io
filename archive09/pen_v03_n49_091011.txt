POSTDOCTORAL RESEARCHER IN PLANETARY MAPPING

The Lunar and Planetary Institute (LPI), a division of the 
Universities Space Research Association invites applications for a 
postdoctoral fellowship in planetary science. The successful candidate
will work with Dr. Paul Schenk, investigating the topography of 
Jupiter's volcanic moon Io using stereo and shape-from-shading 
techniques (although experience in these tools is not required).  A 
variety of landforms will be mapped, including volcanoes and mountains,
as well as regional and global scale shape deviations.  The candidate 
will also be expected to develop their own research projects using 
these data.

For further information, please visit:

http://www.lpi.usra.edu/lpi/positions.shtml 

or applicants should send a letter of interest, a curriculum vita 
with a list of publications, a brief (maximum three pages) statement
of research interests, and a list of three references to 
resume@lpi.usra.edu by October 30, 2009.  Review of candidates will 
begin October 31, 2009, with a hiring decision, as soon as possible 
thereafter. The Universities Space Research Association is an Equal 
Opportunity Employer.

PLANETARY GEOPHYSICS POSTDOCTORAL FELLOWSHIP

The Universities Space Research Association's Lunar and Planetary 
Institute (LPI) in Houston, Texas, invites applicants to apply for a 
postdoctoral fellowship in planetary geophysics. 

The successful candidate will work with Dr. Walter Kiefer on a 
NASA-funded project studying the nature of mantle convection on 
Mars and its effects on the thermal evolution and volcanic history 
of the planet. The candidate will also have the opportunity to conduct
research in planetary geophysics of his or her own choosing.

The position requires a Ph.D. in Planetary Science or Geophysics and 
experience in computer programming and numerical modeling methods, 
particularly finite elements. Experience with parallel computing in 
a Linux environment will be an asset.  Further information on current
research and facilities at the LPI can be found on our website at:

http://www.lpi.usra.edu

POSTDOCTORAL RESEARCHER IN PLANETARY PETROLOGY

The Lunar and Planetary Institute (LPI), a division of the 
Universities Space Research Association, invites applications for a 
postdoctoral fellowship in the petrology of planetary materials. 

The successful candidate will work with Dr. Allan Treiman in 
NASA-funded research focusing on volatiles in magmas and on aqueous 
alteration of igneous rocks; target materials include Martian 
meteorites, lunar samples, and terrestrial analogs.  These efforts 
will start with analyses by optical microscopy and electron microprobe;
other instruments are available as needed at nearby Johnson Space 
Center (experimental petrology laboratories, LA-ICPMS), or can be 
arranged with external collaborators (e.g., SIMS).  The candidate 
will be encouraged to design and conduct her/his own research in 
planetary science, propose for external funding, participate in grant 
review panels and analysis groups, and become involved with spacecraft 
missions.
