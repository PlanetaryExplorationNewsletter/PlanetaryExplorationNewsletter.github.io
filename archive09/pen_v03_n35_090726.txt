SOLO IMPACT ON JUPITER

On 2009 July 19 at approximately 13:30 UTC, Anthony Wesley was 
observing Jupiter from his home observatory just outside Murrumbateman, 
New South Wales, Australia. He noted a black mark in Jupiter's South 
Polar Region (SPR).  This might be due to the impact of either an 
asteroid or comet - similar to the impacts of comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 
in 1994, and exactly 15 years later. Antonio Cidadao of Portugal 
identified the spot in weak methane-band images, supporting an impact 
interpretation. Dr. Glenn Orton (JPL) was at the NASA IRTF and has 
tentatively confirmed the singleton impact with methane-band and 
continuum IR imaging.

The University of Central Florida in Orlando is collecting images and
other information about this event on the following web page:

http://planets.ucf.edu/resources/jupiter-impact

We invite anyone with relevant news to contact us.  In particular, we
seek pre-impact images to constrain the time of impact, images of the
developing impact site, deep circumjovian imaging that might identify
the impactor, and lists of teams submitting DDT proposals, to
coordinate efforts.

NRC DECADAL SURVEY DISCIPLINE PANEL MEMBERSHIP NAMED

Ladies and Gentlemen,

It is my pleasure to announce that the NRC's Executive Office has
approved the nominations of the individuals listed below to serve
on the Inner Planets, Mars, Primitive Bodies and Satellites panels
of the Planetary Sciences Decadal Survey.  Membership of the Giant
Planets Panel will be announced later.  The individuals concerned
will receive appointment paperwork and logistical information
concerning their respective panel meetings in August and September
in the near future.  A complete list of scheduled meeting dates is
given below.

Best wishes,

David H. Smith

COMMUNITY WHITE PAPERS ON SMALL BODIES FOR THE PLANETARY DECADAL SURVEY

The NASA Small Bodies Assessment Group wants to thank the many members 
of our community who have signed up to participate in the following 
white papers to identify top-level science issues and mission 
priorities for the next decade. 

Near-Earth Objects
Asteroids
Comets
Dwarf Planets
Centaurs and Small Irregular TNOs
Interplanetary Dust
Small Irregular Satellites

If you are interested in these areas, the doors remain open for you 
to contribute. Your voice is important! Go to 

http://www.psi.edu/decadal 

and register. The greater the participation in this process, the 
better the result. 

These white papers will be submitted to the Primitive Bodies panel 
for their deliberations near the beginning of September. It will be 
followed by a community discussion for ranking top science issues 
and mission priorities across the above topics online and at the 
upcoming DPS conference (schedule TBD, go to http://dps09.naic.edu/). 
Details and results of that discussion will be transmitted to the 
Primitive Bodies panel for their deliberations in October.

Thank you,

Mark V. Sykes, Chair
Small Bodies Assessment Group

WHITE-PAPER PROPOSAL SITE FOR PLANETARY SCIENCE DECADAL SURVEY

Members of the planetary science and astrobiology communities are 
strongly encouraged to draft white papers and submit them via the 
decadal survey's website.  See 

http://www7.nationalacademies.org/ssb/SSEdecadal_whitepapers.html 

for instructions. To assist the decadal survey plan for the handling, 
distribution and best use of the white papers submitted, authors are 
strongly encouraged to make use of the white-paper proposal site 
established by the Lunar and Planetary Institute:   
http://www.lpi.usra.edu/decadal/.   

Use of the LPI site tells the decadal survey what it can expect to 
receive and it allows you to accrete coauthors. Remember that broad 
community participation is one of the hallmarks of a decadal survey 
and that consensus is compelling.  More information about the planetary 
science decadal survey can be found at 

http://www7.nationalacademies.org/ssb/SSEdecadal2011.html.

SECOND PLANETARY DECADAL SURVEY NEWSLETTER AVAILABLE

Steven Squyres, chair of the National Research Council's Planetary 
Science Decadal Survey, has posted the second of his planned series of 
community newsletters on the survey's website.  The newsletter is 
available at 

http://www7.nationalacademies.org/ssb/SSEdecadal2011_Squyres2.pdf  

Additional information about survey's goals, organization, activities 
and meeting dates is available at

FALL AGU SPECIAL SESSION: DECADAL SURVEY - CALL FOR ABSTRACTS 

The Planetary Science Decadal Survey is organizing a scientific session 
at the Fall AGU meeting entitled "Recent Results in Planetary Science 
and Their Impact on Future Science and Mission Priorities" (see 

http://www.agu.org/meetings/fm09/program/scientific_session_search.php?
show=detail&sessid=558 

for details).  Members of the geosciences, planetary sciences and 
astrobiology communities are encouraged to submit abstracts focusing 
on recent discoveries from solar system exploration missions and 
associated ground based activities that will likely inform decisions 
concerning spacecraft missions to be undertaken during the period 
2013-2022. The session conveners are specifically looking for 
abstracts that:  1. Focus on results announced since 2002; 2. Explain 
why these results are significant relative to current solar system 
goals/priorities; and 3. Outline how these results should influence the 
next generation of solar system exploration missions.  Abstracts will 
be accepted from 30 July until 3 September (see 
http://www.agu.org/meetings/fm09/program/index.php for details).

FALL AGU SPECIAL SESSION: THE GALILEAN SATELLITES' 400TH ANNIVERSARY

As we prepare for the Europa Jupiter System Mission to explore 
Europa, Ganymede, and the Jupiter system, we also celebrate the 400th 
anniversary of the discovery of the Galilean satellites.  Please 
consider contributing an abstract to this special session of the AGU 
fall 2009 meeting in San Francisco, December 14 - 18.  Abstracts are 
due Sept. 3.

P19:  The Galilean Satellites: 400 Years of Discovery

Four hundred years ago, Galileo pointed his spyglass toward the 
planet Jupiter, revealing the four moons that would collectively bear 
his name, and forever changing our place in the heavens.  In the 
centuries since, the Galilean satellites have fundamentally altered 
our understanding of satellite geophysical processes.  Today we are 
preparing for the next decade's outer planets flagship mission, the 
international Europa Jupiter System Mission, which would explore the 
jovian system with two companion spacecraft.  This session will 
concentrate on the geology and geophysics of the four Galilean 
satellites, including: tidal heating, subsurface oceans, interior 
convection, tectonic processes, volcanic processes, and surface 
composition.  Also welcome are contributions on the history of 
exploration or future exploration of the satellites.

FALL AGU SPECIAL SESSION: ENCELADUS - THE PLOT THICKENS

Dear Colleagues,

Due to a misunderstanding that cropped up this year, the proposal for
the AGU Special Session on Enceladus, that was so popular in years 
past, did not get submitted to the AGU on schedule, and as a 
consequence, it unfortunately does not show up on the AGU Scientific 
Program.

However, since this year has been a very exciting one for results on
Enceladus, we certainly aim to have a session devoted to Enceladus at
the Fall 2009 AGU meeting. See the session description below.

To rectify this situation, we've been advised by the AGU Planetary
Session Planning Committee to circulate our Enceladus Special Session
description widely and inform interested individuals to follow these 
steps:

1.  Submit your Enceladus abstracts to Planetary General Contributions
Session:  ie,  Submit to P01: General Contributions.

2.  Be sure to make a note in the COMMENTS field that your abstract
should be included in the session focused on Enceladus.

Sorry for this departure from the usual, and hope to see you at the AGU.

Best,
Carolyn Porco
Chris McKay

FALL AGU SPECIAL SESSION: PHYSICS OF ANELASTICITY AND DISSIPATION IN
EARTH AND PLANETARY BODIES

Session: MR02

Conveners:

Description:
This session aims to review our understanding of the mechanisms 
driving the anelastic and viscoelastic behavior of planetary 
materials for the frequency range 10^-8 to 0.1 Hz relevant to seismic 
and tidal stresses. These planetary materials range from Earth's rock 
to planetary ices, including porous material and partially molten 
rocks. We are hoping for an interdisciplinary session gathering 
specialists in Earth and planetary science. Part of the session will 
address anelasticity as observed in laboratory and in nature (e.g., 
seismic wave attenuation). Another part of the session will explore the 
consequences of material anelasticity (e.g., response to tidal stress 
of terrestrial ice shelves and of outer planet satellites, binary 
asteroids, etc.)
