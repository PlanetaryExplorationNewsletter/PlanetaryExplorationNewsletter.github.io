NEW "DISCOVERIES IN PLANETARY SCIENCE" CLASSROOM POWERPOINTS AVAILABLE

The DPS Education Subcommittee announces the 2nd release of 
"Discoveries in Planetary Science" Classroom Powerpoints, covering six 
new topics:
  - Discovery of a Rocky Exoplanet
  - Lunar Water
  - Jupiter Impact Event
  - Oceans on Enceladus
  - The TC3 Meteorite
  - 2012 Doomsday Rumors

These are succinct summaries of discoveries too recent to appear in 
"Intro Astronomy" college textbooks; each set consists of just three 
slides to be shown: the discovery itself, a basic explanation based 
on good planetary science, and the "big picture" context.  Another 
page for further information is provided as well.  Powerpoints and 
PDFs can be downloaded from 

http://dps.aas.org/education/dpsdisc

Feedback from the community on how these slide sets are used and 
received is welcomed, and will be used to improve future releases.  
Planetary scientists with recent or upcoming results of broad 
interest are encouraged to submit them for consideration by providing 
an initial draft using the template provided on the website.

Nick Schneider and Dave Brain

THE VIEW FROM 5 AU: MEASURING THE DIFFUSE SKY BRIGHTNESS FROM THE 
OUTER SOLAR SYSTEM

March 25-26, 2010
Beckman Center, University of California, Irvine

http://www.physics.uci.edu/5AU/

This is a focused workshop to establish the scientific case for
conducting cruise-phase observations of the extragalactic background 
and for imaging the outer interplanetary dust cloud from the unique 
vantage point of the outer solar system as part of a future planetary 
mission.

Topics will include:

Extragalactic Background
Galaxy Evolution Models
Reionization
Oort Cloud, Kuiper Belt and Trans Neptunian Objects
Zodiacal Light Models
Microlensing and similar applications
The Search for Exoplanets
Instrument Concepts

Priority will be given for talks that can help establish
the scientific case for observations from 5 AU, and central questions
related to extragalactic science, planetary science, and 
instrumentation requirements given at the conference website.

Posters are encouraged. Participants are invited to contribute to the 
final workshop summary report that will be delivered to NASA on
the scientific need wand the basic outline of an instrument needed 
for sky brightness measurements from a future planetary mission.

Attendance will be limited to approximately 70 participants.
There is no  registration fee.

Registration deadline: January 15, 2010.
