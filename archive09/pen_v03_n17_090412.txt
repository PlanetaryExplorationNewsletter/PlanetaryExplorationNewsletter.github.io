EUROPEAN PLANETARY SCIENCE CONGRESS

The European Planetary Science Congress (EPSC) will be held this year 
in Potsdam, Germany, 13-18 September. Abstracts are due 8 May.

http://meetings.copernicus.org/epsc2009/

We'd like to call your attention to the following special sessions 
which are relevant to outer planet science, including the Europa 
Jupiter System Mission (EJSM):

*Giant planet systems
*Satellite atmospheres and exospheres
*Satellite surfaces, interiors, and exchange processes
*Ganymede science and exploration

The program will also include two workshops specific to the EJSM:

*In situ exploration of Europa and Ganymede
*Observational techniques for the Jovian system

INSTRUMENT WORKSHOP

The Europa Jupiter System Mission (EJSM) will hold its second 
Instrument Workshop on July 15-17, 2009 at John Hopkins University 
Applied Physics Laboratory in Laurel, Maryland. Information on this 
workshop will be updated periodically at: 

http://opfm.jpl.nasa.gov

The workshop will focus on the NASA-led Jupiter Europa Orbiter (JEO)
mission element; there will also be discussion on the ESA Jupiter
Ganymede Orbiter (JGO), EJSM status, plans for instrument selection,
model payloads, and technical challenges facing instrument providers
(in particular the radiation environment). Many of the technical
discussions will be applicable to both JEO and the ESA-led JGO flight
elements of EJSM. Potential European and U.S. instrument providers
will be given an opportunity to provide an abstract for an instrument
poster to be displayed during an Instrument Poster session.  NASA 
Headquarters will send out, in advance of the Instrument Workshop,
an RFI to industry and others in the radiation field (design,
analysis, test, etc.) to seek interest in providing expertise,
including at this workshop. Those responding will be given opportunity
to provide a one page synopsis of capability that will be published as
part of the workshop, and to provide a poster or display booth for a 
Radiation Capability session.
