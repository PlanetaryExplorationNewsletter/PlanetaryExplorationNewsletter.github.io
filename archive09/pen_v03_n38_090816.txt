MARS DECADAL SURVEY WHITE PAPERS

To Members of the Mars Science Community,

The NRC's Decadal Survey has called for white papers of relevance to
planetary exploration: 

http://www7.nationalacademies.org/ssb/SSEdecadal2011.html

They strongly encourage the involvement/support of multiple members 
of the community to reflect important consensus positions. The MEPAG 
strategy to support this process is:

# The MEPAG web site: 

  http://mepag.jpl.nasa.gov/decadal/index.html

  will post Mars-related white papers for community review and 
  consideration.

# Authors are those who substantively contribute to a document's 
  formulation.

# Members of the community are invited to endorse the white papers as 
  "signatories". It is permitted and encouraged to endorse more than 
  one white paper - these documents cover independent aspects of Mars 
  exploration. The NRC's deadline is September 15, 2009, so your 
  action is needed by September 1.

# We are working on setting up a web-based process to help collect and 
  manage the signatory lists. More information on this shortly.

# Some formal MEPAG white papers will be presented under the authorship
  of the MEPAG Chair on behalf of the entire organization - for these, 
  signatories will not be requested.

For credibility, please read the paper (not just title!) before 
endorsing.

Sincerely,

Dr. Jack Mustard, MEPAG Chair
