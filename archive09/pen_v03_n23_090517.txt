LPL FACULTY POSITIONS AVAILABLE

The Lunar and Planetary Laboratory at The University of Arizona expects
to fill up to 2 non-tenure track faculty positions at the level of
Assistant, Associate, or Senior Research Scientist. These ranks are
equivalent to the corresponding professorial ranks, but without a
commitment for state support or teaching responsibility. Research
Scientists report to the director of the Lunar and Planetary 
Laboratory. Salary and position title will be based on the 
qualifications of the selected candidate(s), who will be responsible 
for raising 100% of their salaries and research funds through their own 
extramural grants and contracts. Apply online at www.hr.arizona.edu; 
reference job #42950. The University of Arizona is an AA/EEO/ADA 
employer - M/W/D/V.

Appointment at the rank of Assistant Research Scientist requires 
demonstrated solid scientific accomplishments and clear promise of 
continued achievement. Candidates for the position of Associate or 
Senior Research Scientist must demonstrate an internationally 
recognized record of distinguished scientific achievement and 
leadership in planetary sciences. Duties and Responsibilities:  
Establishes and maintains a distinguished research program in any area 
of planetary science, broadly defined. Minimum Qualifications: Ph.D. in 
a related field.

Salary:  DOE
Benefits: Yes
Hours: 40 per week
Opening: Immediately
Closing: Open until filled

[NASA] DRAFT DISCOVERY PROGRAM DRAFT AO TO BE RELEASED

Schedule:

06/09 Release of draft AO (target)
11/09 Release of final AO (target)
11/09+3 wks Pre-proposal conference
11/09+90 days Proposals due
07/10 Selection for competitive Phase A studies
05/11 Concept study reports due 
11/11 Down-selection
Before 1/1/17 Launch date

All Missions of Opportunity are now solicited through the Stand Alone 
Mission of Opportunity Notice (SALMON) AO.

Discovery Program investigations must address NASA's planetary science 
goals as described in 

http://nasascience.nasa.gov/about-us/science-strategy/.

Launch Vehicle costs and procurement will be the responsibility of 
NASA. Launch vehicle standard services will be provided as GFE and the 
cost will not be included in the cost cap. 

Investigations are capped at a life-cycle cost of $425M (FY10), 
excluding standard launch services and, if required, ASRGs.  

The Draft Discovery AO will be based on the Standard PI-led Mission AO 
Template available at 

http://sso.larc.nasa.gov/aosimplification.html. 

Proposers should read the Draft Discovery AO carefully when it is 
released.

Further information will be posted at http://discovery.larc.nasa.gov/.

[NASA] PLANETARY SCIENCE ADVISORY COMMITTEE TO MEET

The Planetary Science Subcommittee of the Science Committee of the  
NASA Advisory Council will meet at NASA HQ on July 9-10, 2009. All PSS  
meetings are open to the public and we hope to provide access to  
presentations via the internet. An agenda will be available closer to  
the meeting date.

FAULT AND FRACTURE STUDIES IN THE SOLAR SYSTEM

Please consider submitting an abstract to session T71 at the 2009 GSA 
annual meeting in Portland, OR (Oct 18-21).  
 
T71. (Title above)
Planetary Geology / Structural Geology and Tectonics Divisions
Convener: Simon Kattenhorn

This session involves studies of the evolution and mechanics of 
non-terrestrial fault and fracture systems through spacecraft image 
analysis, theoretical models, or geophysical techniques.

Spacecraft missions have identified exquisite and often enigmatic 
fault and fracture patterns that tell of a long and complex tectonic 
history on many solar system bodies. These include terrestrial planets 
(Mercury, Venus, Mars), icy moons (e.g. Europa, Ganymede, Enceladus, 
Dione), and asteroids. Observations and theoretical considerations 
of terrestrial analogs aid in interpretations of tectonic deformation 
features in the solar system. We encourage submissions that illustrate 
how geometric, kinematic, and mechanical models of fault and fracture 
development, which have their basis in terrestrial studies, can be used 
to unravel the deformation histories of other solar system bodies. 
Terrestrial analog studies must show direct application to 
non-terrestrial examples. Appropriate topics include the evolution and 
mechanics of fault systems, global or regional fracture patterns on 
planets or moons, and magmatic fracturing.

Deadline: August 11, midnight, EST.
