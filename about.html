The Planetary Exploration Newsletter (PEN) was first distributed on May 24, 2007.
<br><br>
PEN provides an open conduit of 
news and announcements across the professional community of planetary science 
and related disciplines. It distributes messages from NASA officials, 
meeting announcements, job announcements, and your 
submissions of news regarding or impacting Solar System exploration, upcoming 
mission events, policy issues, and editorials. PEN is distributed 
nominally once a week. There will be times when volume or events will require 
more frequent PEN distributions. 
<br><br>
The PEN website also hosts the most extensive and up to date calendar for 
planetary meetings, conferences and workshops around the world.
<br><br>
On March 23, 2020, PEN entered into an agreement with the Division for Planetary Sciences of the American Astronomical Society to carry a weekly listing of new articles published in the new Planetary Science Journal, with direct links to each paper.
