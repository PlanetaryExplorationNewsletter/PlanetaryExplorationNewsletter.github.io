<b>SUBMISSION DIRECTIONS</b>
</center>
<br><br>
Please send all replies and submissions to pen_editor at psi.edu. Please note in the Subject line if the announcement is Commercial (sale of a product or service) or Donative (request for donations). Editors reserve the right to modify announcements for display considerations, spelling and grammar.
<br><br>
<b>DEADLINE:</b> Send announcements to pen_editor at psi.edu by 5pm MST Friday for inclusion in the Sunday issue (late items will be included the following Sunday).
<br><br>
<b>WORD LIMIT:</b> All announcements are limited to a maximum of 200 words (title plus text). Extended information (e.g., for job ads or meeting information) should be provided by URLs within the text. Announcements exceeding 200 words will be edited for length or returned to the submitter for modification.
<br><br>
<b>TWEETS:</b> All PEN submissions will be tweeted @pen2tweets. Please submit a 234 (or fewer) character tweet that begins with the announcement title for a given announcement. 46 characters are reserved for the PEN tag in each tweet, e.g.:<br><br>
planetarynews.org<br>
v16n26-10<br>
@planetarysci<br><br>
This indicates volume 16, issue 26, item number 10. Alternatively, the editorial staff will create one for you.
<br><br>
<b>FORMAT:</b> Please submit all announcements in plain text. No images or attachments are distributed through PEN. 
<br><br>
<b>PRONOUNS:</b> With the increased use of old and new pronouns, we want to be respectful of people's desired usage of pronouns, including non-binary. We invite everyone to share their pronouns in announcements if they wish. Because editors and some of our editing tools do not necessarily recognize the particular usage or spelling of all pronouns, when submitting an announcement it would be helpful to include a note to the editor about how it is desired for pronouns to appear.
<br><br>
<b>MEETING CALENDAR:</b> To add a meeting to the PEN Meeting Calendar send the title, date, location and URL to pen_editor at psi.edu.
<br><br>
<b>EDITORIALS AND COMMENTARIES:</b> The PEN welcomes editorials and commentaries related to planetary science, solar system exploration, how they are conducted, their politics, their funding, their management, and their future. Please provide the title with 'EDITORIAL:' at the beginning. Include your name and affiliation in the text. Text + Title are limited to 200 words. If your comments are more extensive, please provide a URL to the full text. If you need a URL, we can post your editorial at planetarypolicy.org and provide the link in the PEN announcement.
<br><br>
<b>JOB ANNOUNCEMENTS:</b> These should include position title, institution, and a brief description of the job (conforming to the 200 word limit above). A URL link within the text should be included for an extended job description and application procedure. 
<br><br>
<b>COMMERCIAL ANNOUNCEMENTS:</b> Announcements for commercial products or services are welcome if they are planetary-related (e.g., books, software, lab or field equipment, educational materials). Please put "Commercial:" in the subject line. Commercial announcements are put in their own section of the PEN (view Archives for examples).
