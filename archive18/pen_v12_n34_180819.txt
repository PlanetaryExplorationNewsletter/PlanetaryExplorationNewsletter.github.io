LSST AND THE SOLAR SYSTEM WORKSHOP

October 24, 2018 4:30-6:00 pm 50th DPS meeting, Knoxville, TN

Over its 10 year lifespan, the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST)
will catalog >5 million Main Belt asteroids, ~300,000 Jupiter Trojans,
>100,000 NEOs, >40,000 KBOs, tens of interstellar objects, and >10,000
comets. Many of these objects will receive hundreds of observations in
multiple bandpasses. The LSST Solar System Science Collaboration (SSSC)
is preparing methods and tools to analyze this data and understand
optimum survey strategies for discovering moving objects throughout the
Solar System.

This workshop is the annual meeting of the LSST SSSC and is open to
everyone. We will provide updates on current and future activities
within the SSSC. The emphasis will be on details relevant to Solar
System science topics (not general LSST background), and discussions
and presentations will focus on the development of the LSST Moving
Object Processing System (MOPS), the SSSC's feedback/input on upcoming
LSST survey cadence decisions, and future community follow-up
opportunities. There will be time set aside for open discussion for
both members of the SSSC and the broader planetary community.

Contact organizers Meg Schwamb (Gemini Observatory,
mschwamb.astro@gmail.com) and David Trilling (NAU,
David.Trilling@nau.edu) with any questions.

AGU LATE-BREAKING SESSION ON THE GLOBAL DUST STORM OF 2018

Conveners: Richard Zurek and Leslie Tamppari (JPL-Caltech)

Consider submitting an abstract to the new, late-breaking session
covering the large martian global dust storm which began in June 2018! 
Extended abstract deadline is 15 September 2018. Even if you have
already submitted an abstract to the Fall Meeting, you may still submit
a second abstract to this session. For more information, please visit
the AGU Fall Meeting website at:

https://fallmeeting.agu.org/2018/abstract-submissions/

On June 1, a local dust storm moved out of the north circumpolar jet
stream in the martian atmosphere, expanding and triggering new
dust-raising centers. By late June, it had become a planet-encircling
dust event (PEDE). This PEDE was the second earliest such event. These
events are the major component of interannual-to-decadal variability
and pose a challenge to solar powered, surface-based flight systems,
namely the Opportunity rover and possibly the upcoming InSight lander.
We solicit observational and modeling presentations related to this
year's PEDE, its onset and decay phase, and its context within the
history of such events, including data acquired by observers from the
various Mars flight missions and from Earth-based observers.

observatory-habex-community-science-meeting/

The Habitable Exoplanet Observatory (HabEx) is one of four concepts
currently under study by NASA in preparation for the 2020 Astrophysics
Decadal Survey. HabEx is designed to be the next-generation great
observatory that has the capability to address physics of the cosmos,
cosmic origins, solar system, and exoplanet science. HabEx is a
space-based 4-meter diameter telescope with ultraviolet, optical, and
near-infrared imaging and spectroscopy capabilities, and at least 50%
of the primary 5-year mission will be dedicated to community
involvement through a competed and funded Guest Observer (GO) program.

The purpose of this meeting is to invite members of the community to
present scientific investigations and observational programs that: 
* Will be important and relevant in the 2030's. 
* Can be specifically conducted - or could benefit from synergistic 
  observations - with HabEx.

To apply to give a presentation, abstract submissions are due by
September 7th. The registration deadline to attend the meeting is
October 1st.

More information on HabEx can be found on the mission website and in

[NASA] ROSES-18 AMENDMENT 22: C.14 PSTAR NOT SOLICITED THIS YEAR
 
ROSES-18 Amendment 22: Planetary Science and Technology Through Analog
Research, program element C.14 of ROSES-2018, will not be solicited
this year.

The Planetary Science and Technology through Analog Research (PSTAR)
program solicits proposals for investigations focused on exploring the
relevant environments on Earth in order to develop a sound technical
and scientific basis to conduct planetary research on other Solar
System bodies.

It has been decided not to solicit PSTAR in ROSES-18 since the
Planetary Science division does not foresee having the budget to fund
new awards along with existing commitments. It is anticipated that
PSTAR will be solicited in ROSES-2019.
