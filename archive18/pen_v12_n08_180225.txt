ROSSBYPALOOZA-2018

The Department of the Geophysical Sciences at The University of Chicago
is hosting Rossbypalooza-2018. It is a two-week long, hackathon-style
summer school bringing together graduate students and postdocs from a
broad field of atmospheric, oceanic and (exo)planetary sciences to
attend lectures and work on group projects of their choice. The topic
for this year is "Understanding climate through simple models".

The school will run from June 11th - 22nd. The application is open
until April 10th, 2018. For more information, please visit:

EUROPLANET WORKSHOP ANNOUNCEMENT

A Europlanet workshop on "Planetary Atmospheric Erosion" will be held
June 11-15 at Puflene Resort, Murighiol, Romania. Puflene Resort is
located in the Danube Delta - where the Danube River meets the Black
Sea.

The objectives of this Europlanet workshop are:

* to discuss processes and mechanisms for atmospheric erosions in
  planetary atmospheres
* to present upcoming and proposed missions within this field
* to explore collaborations and funding opportunities
* to discuss new ideas, challenges and solutions

The workshop will be a mix of tutorials, presentations and ample time
for discussion.

Travel support is available for a limited number of selected
participants, in particular for early career scientists from Europlanet
Inclusive states.

The deadline for hotel booking is April 15, 2018. The deadline for
abstract submission, early bird registration, and travel support
application is April 30, 2018.

VENUS EXPLORATION EVENTS AT LPSC
 
A Venus special oral session, 21st Century Venus I: Atmosphere to
Interior will be held at 1:30 p.m. on Tuesday, March 20, 2018 in
Waterway Ballroom 5, followed by a poster session that evening.

Venus Exploration Analysis Group (VEXAG) will conduct a Venus Town Hall
Meeting and an evening Early Career Scholars Mixer at LPSC on Thursday,
March 22, 2017.

The objective of this Venus Town Hall meeting in Waterways Meeting
Rooms 1-3 at 12:00 to 1:15 PM is to encourage a community discussion
and receive feedback on the current Venus community activities. Agenda
items will include an update on NASA Planetary Science Division
activities.

Also, please, join the VEXAG Student/Early Career Scholars Focus Group
for an Informal Meet and Greet at the Grogan's Mill (no-host bar) on
Thursday afternoon at 5:00 to 7:00 PM after the oral sessions and
before the posters. Please check the VEXAG - Early Career Scholars
Facebook page for more information:

DIFFERENTIATION CONFERENCE: ABSTRACT DEADLINE MARCH 1

The abstract deadline for Differentiation: Building the Internal
Architecture of Planets is March 1. The focus of this conference is on
understanding the physical and chemical conditions associated with the
formation of crusts, cores, atmospheres, and oceans on both rocky and
volatile-rich bodies. We seek input from many types of studies,
including petrologic, isotopic, trace element, and paleo-magnetic
analyses of samples, geophysical probes of planetary interiors, and
experimental and numerical simulations. There will be an optional,
pre-conference field trip to an anorthosite complex in the San Gabriel
Mountains on May 7. The conference will consist of 3.5 days of
presentations and discussion, May 8-11, ending by noon on May 11.

Abstracts are limited to ONE page and should be submitted via the
conference website:

www.hou.usra.edu/meetings/differentiation2018/

Some travel support will be available for early career individuals and
should also be applied for via the conference website. 

For additional information, contact the lead conference convener,
Walter Kiefer (kiefer@lpi.usra.edu).
