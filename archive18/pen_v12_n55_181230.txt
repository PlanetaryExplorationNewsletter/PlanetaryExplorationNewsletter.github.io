NEW HORIZONS ULTIMA THULE FLYBY ON 31 DECEMBER/1 JANUARY - GETTING THE 
WORD OUT TO ENGAGE THE PUBLIC IN THE FIRST EXPLORATION OF A KBO

On December 31 and January 1, NASA's New Horizons mission will make the 
first close reconnaissance of a KBO, 2014 MU69, aka Ultima Thule. This 
challenging and scientifically exciting flyby will make the farthest 
exploration of worlds in history, a billion miles beyond Pluto.

Extensive flyby social media and TV coverage begins on Dec. 28. The 
mission website at: 

http://pluto.jhuapl.edu 

has links to Twitter (hashtags #UltimaThule and #UltimaFlyby), other 
social media channels, and live streams carrying the event. More is 
here: 

http://pluto.jhuapl.edu/News-Center/Where-to-Watch.php

If the government shutdown has ended, this coverage will include NASA 
social accounts and NASA TV; but even if not, numerous traditional and 
social media, as well as TV channels will be covering the flyby and 
its ensuring early results.

Public engagement is a key factor in support for the NASA planetary 
program. The New Horizons mission team asks community members to help 
spread the word about this exciting exploration using social media 
channels, mailing lists, and other means over the next few days as we 
approach and then flyby Ultima.

ABSCICON 2019 SESSION: PLANETARY PROTECTION FOR ASTROBIOLOGY - PROGRESS 
AND CHALLENGES IN SCIENCE AND POLICY

We invite you to submit an abstract to the 2019 Astrobiology Science 
Conference, which will be held on 24-28 June 2019 in Bellevue, 
Washington.

Planetary protection is an ongoing concern, especially for missions to 
Mars, Phobos/Deimos, Europa, Enceladus, and Titan - and with a special 
concern for sample return missions to Earth.  We aim to highlight 
current developments in the policy, science, and implementation of 
planetary protection, including the identification of research and 
technology challenges for robotic and human missions. Topics of 
interest include spacecraft microbiology and biochemistry; 
survivability and possible evolution of microorganisms in 
environments associated with spacecraft assembly, operation, and 
exploration; microbial monitoring in human habitats and in human 
support systems; transport of human/robotic mission bioburden in 
extraterrestrial environments; bioburden reduction and prevention 
technologies; sample acquisition and containment technologies, and 
return-to-earth schema and facilities for Earth sample processing.

ABSCICON 2019 SESSION: THE IMPACT OF ASTROSPHERIC SPACE WEATHER ON 
EXOPLANETARY HABITABILITY

This session addresses the broad question of a set of factors an 
exoplanet requires for enabling life as we know it to thrive, and the 
impact of the planet's host star on habitability in light of recent 
discoveries of rocky exoplanets in the habitable zones around FGKM 
stars. We invite abstracts of theoretical, observational and laboratory 
studies with a particular focus on: (a) the erosion of atmospheres and 
oceans by thermal and non-thermal escape mechanisms; (b) impact on 
exoplanetary atmospheric chemistry; (c) pathways for igniting molecular 
complexity (including prebiotic chemistry) via ionizing radiation and 
energetic particles, (d) modulation of atmospheric biosignatures vis 
space weather effects, and (e) effects of exoplanetary magnetic fields 
on planetary habitability and observational strategies to detect them. 
We encourage submission of cross-disciplinary presentations aimed at 
uniting the physics and chemistry of habitable environments in a 
holistic fashion.

Conveners: V. Airapetian (NASA GSFC), C. Dong (Princeton University), 
A. Rymer (JHU), M. Gudel (University of Vienna), N. Hud (Georgia Tech), 
M. Way (GISS), M. Lingam (CfA), E. Provornikova (CUA), C. Harman (GISS)

ABSCICON 2019 SESSION: ORIGINS AND EVOLUTION PATHWAYS OF ORGANICS IN 
OCEAN WORLDS

You are invited to submit abstracts to our session dedicated to the 
organic matter evolution: 

https://agu.confex.com/agu/abscicon19/prelim.cgi/Session/65833

Evidence for organics on planetary surfaces (or atmosphere in the case 
of Titan) has been found across the solar system with telescopic 
observations. Organics compounds have been recently observed with 
spacecraft at Enceladus and Titan (Cassini) and Ceres (Dawn). 
Understanding the origins and fates of carbon and organics in ocean 
worlds is an important topic considering the potential of these 
bodies for fostering conditions conducive to the development of 
biomolecules. Multiple pathways may occur depending on environmental 
conditions in the early ocean and the long-term evolution of the 
interior. Predicting the cycling of accreted carbon compounds, local 
prebiotic chemistry, and the mechanisms driving surface exposure 
requires interdisciplinary research covering astrochemical and 
geochemical modeling, meteorite analyses, material physics, and 
geophysical processes in order to understand the information 
contained in observations returned by telescopic and spacecraft 
observations.

Submission deadline: 23 January 2019 23:59 EST.

Please fell free to forward this message to interested parties and 
see you in Seattle.

NEW TOPIC ADDED TO LPSC ABSTRACT DROP-DOWN LIST: PLANETARY SPATIAL DATA
INFRASTRUCTURE

Dear Colleagues,

We'd like to alert you to the fact that a new topical selection has 
been added to the drop-down menu for Lunar and Planetary Science 
Conference (LPSC) abstracts: "Planetary Spatial Data Infrastructure." 
This topic is intended to incorporate contributions that address the 
tasks of storing, discovering, accessing, and utilizing planetary 
spatial data. 

Please direct any questions to Prof. Jani Radebaugh (janirad@byu.edu). 

The meeting will be March 18-22, 2019 in the Woodlands, TX, and the 
abstract deadline is Tuesday, January 8, 2019 5:00 PM CST (GMT -6).

PLANETARY GEOMORPHOLOGY AT EGU 2019 DEADLINE

The abstract deadline is fast approaching (10 January 2019, 13:00 CET)
for EGU 2019 (Vienna Austria 7-12 April) including the Planetary
Geomorphology session GM1.5/PS1.2.

Our invited speaker this year is Marisa Palucis, who studies 
hillslopes, river channels, alluvial fans, and deltas on Earth and Mars 
and is a member of the MSL (Curiosity Rover) science team.

The Planetary Geomorphology session welcomes abstracts concerning
landforms, landscapes and the processes that shape them on all solar
system bodies. Novel approaches using remote sensing data, Earth
analogue studies and flume/simulation work and are particularly
encouraged. This session provides a stimulating forum for
cross-disciplinary discussion so join us once again for a mix of
geomorphology and planetary science.
