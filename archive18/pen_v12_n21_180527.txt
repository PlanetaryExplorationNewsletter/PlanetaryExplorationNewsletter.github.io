GEOSCIENCES SPECIAL ISSUE RECENT ADVANCES IN LUNAR STUDIES

Dear Colleagues,

The journal Geosciences is accepting papers for a Special Issue related
to recent advances in studies of the Moon. Since the Apollo era, sample
studies, remote analyses, and dynamical models continue to tease out
details related to the Moon's formation and evolution. Additionally,
the international lunar science community is eager to continue its
presence on the Moon, as evidenced by recent, upcoming, and future
lunar missions. All of these topics are of great interest to the
broader geoscience community.

The Special Issue welcomes papers that describe studies related to any
of the above topics and will be an outlet for rapid, accessible, and
peer-reviewed publications. The editors especially welcome papers from
young investigators. The deadline for manuscript submissions is 15 June
2018.

REMINDER CALL FOR VEXAG STEERING COMMITTEE MEMBERS DUE JUNE 1, 2018

VEXAG is seeking three new volunteers for the VEXAG Steering Committee
to replace the Members at Large who have successfully completed their
service to the Venus community. New members will start in August 2018
and terms will run for three years.

If you are interested, send your resume and a statement of how you
could contribute to VEXAG to Bob Grimm and Martha Gilmore, VEXAG Chair
and Deputy Chair (grimm@boulder.swri.edu, mgilmore@wesleyan.edu) by
June 1, 2018.

In addition to sponsoring regular and topical meetings, VEXAG
activities for the next three years are expected to focus on updating
the science, technology, and roadmap guidance documents, supporting
mission studies and international collaborations, preparing white
papers for the next Decadal Survey, and implementing the outcome of 
the Decadal Survey. VEXAG is committed to fostering the next generation
of Venus researchers and participation in Early Career Venus Scholars
Focus Group is always welcome.

VEXAG is a community-based forum established in July 2005 to assess
scientific priorities and strategies for exploration of Venus. For more

SPICE TRAINING SECOND ANNOUNCEMENT

The ESA SPICE Service (ESS) and the Navigation and Ancillary
Information Facility (NAIF) will conduct a SPICE observation geometry
training class on June 19-22, 2018 in Madrid, SPAIN. SPICE at ESA is
described at:

http://www.cosmos.esa.int/web/spice/home

The class is free and open to all professionals and students involved
in Solar System exploration. Further information about the class and
the class registration form are found at:

https://www.cosmos.esa.int/web/spice/training-class-june-2018

Three grants are available for European students to cover Travel
expenses.

Registration is due by June 5, 2018.

THEMATIC SCHOOL - FLUID-ROCK INTERACTIONS IN THE SOLAR SYSTEM

The Laboratoire de Planetologie et Geodynamique organises the second
GeoPlaNet thematic school on Fluid-Rock Interactions in the Solar
System. The event will take place in Nantes (France) from next 
November 12th to 16th.

This school in Planetary Geosciences will present to participants
various techniques for observing, analysing, experimenting and
modelling the compositional and morphological aspects of fluid-rock
interactions in rocky and icy bodies of all sizes of the Solar System.

The school will include lectures and practicals, as well as poster
presentations by attendees. It will be organised along two themes: 
1) Fluid-rock interactions on planetary surfaces: 
   Fluid-related rock deformation, rock weathering, sedimentation,
   hydrothermalism; 
   Spectroscopy of rocks and minerals, field excursion, experimental 
   modelling, laboratory analyses; 
2) Fluid-rock interactions in planetary interiors: 
   Icy ocean worlds, mantle dynamics, volatile cycle, metasomatism, 
   deep magmatic source; 
   Petrology, geochemistry, geophysics, laboratory analyses, 
   experimentation, numerical modelling.
   
This high-level training program is open to 80 international Master
students, PhD students and young researchers with a background in
geosciences and/or in planetary science.

APPLICATIONS FOR GSA PLANETARY GEOLOGY DIVISION JUNIOR STUDENT ADVISORY
MEMBER DUE JUNE 1

This position, open to graduate students, offers students an
opportunity to actively engage with the PGD officers and planetary
community in an important role on this service committee.
Responsibilities include, but are not limited to, updating and
maintaining the Student Opportunities page on the PGD website, helping
to staff and provide student-related materials at the PGD booth during
the GSA annual meeting and at LPSC, running the annual button design
contest, serving as a PGD representative to the GSA Student Advisory
Council, and participating in and taking notes during regularly
scheduled PGD telecons. This is a two-year position (second year as a
Senior Student Advisor), and includes one partial travel award to
attend and present first-author research at the annual GSA meeting. 

To apply, email a current one-page CV (include discipline and advisor)
and a short justification (~300-500 words) on why you are interested in
serving as a PGD Student Advisor. Justification should focus on your
record of previous community involvement and public service. More

Asteroid Engineering Laboratory in Kiruna, Sweden.

A Ph.D. in planetary science, astronomy, geosciences, geoengineering,
space engineering, or a related field is meriting, as well as
experience in numerical modeling and experimental research on
meteorites and/or other geological materials.

Deadline for applications is June 30, 2018.
