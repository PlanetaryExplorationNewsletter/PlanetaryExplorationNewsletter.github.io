TENURE-TRACK FACULTY POSITION IN GEOCHEMISTRY - EARTH/PLANETARY
PROCESSES

The Department of Earth, Environmental and Planetary Sciences at Brown
University

http://www.brown.edu/academics/earth-environmental-planetary-sciences/

invites applications for a tenure-track faculty appointment in
geochemistry. Any analytical, experimental and theoretical/
computational approach to understanding the origin and chemical
evolution of the Earth and planets will be considered. Some examples
include, but are not limited to, cosmochemistry, planetary petrology,
non-traditional stable isotope geochemistry, early Earth evolution,
volcanology, and interactions of planetary materials with hydrospheres
and atmospheres. Preference will be given to candidates whose strengths
complement departmental research expertise in Geochemistry and
Petrology, Planetary Geoscience, Geophysics, and Climate and
Environment. We seek scientists whose research integrates field
observations, geochemical analyses, experimental studies, and
geochemical theory and/or modeling. We are interested in scientists
whose research transcends traditional boundaries in geochemistry, such
as between high-temperature and low-temperature geochemistry,
geochemistry and geophysics, and terrestrial and planetary.

Apply at:

Inquiries and other communications: DEEPS@Brown.edu

Applications received by November 1st, 2018 will receive full
consideration. The start date is July 1st, 2019.

WOMEN IN SPACE CONFERENCE

February 7-8, 2019
ASU SkySong, Scottsdale, AZ

Women in Space 2019 is an expansion of the Women in Planetary Science
2018 conference held in Toronto. This event is an opportunity for
scientists and engineers to showcase their work in the field of space
and planetary science. The event highlights the achievements of women
and non-binary researchers, while offering an opportunity to discuss,
challenge, network, and support their peers.

Supporting #WomenInSTEM is the prime goal of this event.

We encourage geologists, geophysicists, engineers, geographers,
biologists, chemists, physicists, astronomers, social scientists, and
any other people working in or researching a related field to apply. Of
particular interest are students studying space law, space exploration
history, or commercial aspects of space exploration.

Indication of interest, abstract submission, and registration are open
at:

peer review. Finding and using PDS data will also be covered.

Sign up for an individual session to get your specific questions
answered, or come to one of the scheduled group sessions: 

http://pds-training.psi.edu

Available topics:

- Finding PDS Data
- General training on PDS4 (either for missions or R&A archives)

INPUT REQUESTED FOR SOLAR SYSTEM SCIENCE WITH ASTROPHYSICS ASSETS,
DEADLINE EXTENDED
 
A committee has been established to determine what the capabilities are
for current/pending/future Astrophysics Assets. This effort follows a
number of Solar System working groups that were organized for JWST and
WFIRST (among others). Many lessons learned will carry over to other
future missions, but requirements or desirements for all wavelengths
should be considered in the era of the next large astrophysics mission
(e.g. LUVOIR, OST, HabEX, LYNX, etc). 
 
The goal to compile a uniform set of basic capabilities and needs to
maximize the yield of Solar System science with future Astrophysics
missions while allowing those missions to achieve their Astrophysics
priorities.
 
Here we are seeking input from the community to be considered. All
recommendations will be considered and compiled into a report for
NASA's Planetary Science and Astrophysics Divisions to consider.
 
This is the last chance to provide your input(!) so please fill this
form out by October 12th.

POSTDOCTORAL POSITION IN COMETARY SCIENCE/ASTROCHEMISTRY

We are currently seeking expertise in millimeter/submillimeter
spectroscopy and observations with ground-based facilities including
single dish and interferometers at these wavelengths (e.g. ALMA, JCMT,
IRAM 30m, NOEMA, APEX, etc.). Familiarity with cometary science and/or
astrochemistry is preferred. Details on the position can be found
through NASA's Postdoctoral Program (NPP) at this link:

https://npp.usra.edu/opportunities/details/?ro=18599

The Theory and Observation Group in the Astrochemistry Laboratory at
NASA Goddard Space Flight Center (Greenbelt, MD) undertakes research in
astrochemistry and molecular astrophysics aimed at understanding those
astronomical environments that are to be studied by current and future
NASA missions. We are particularly interested in the chemical
connections between different stages in the Galactic evolution of
matter, specifically issues related to the birth and death of stars,
the formation and evolution of the Solar System, and prebiotic
chemistry.

Applications are due November 1, 2018. Details about NASA Postdoctoral
Positions, applications, eligibility, benefits are found at: 

https://npp.usra.edu/

We encourage interested applicants to please contact us with a brief
description of research interests, experience, and a current CV no
later than October 1, 2018. Please send information to Stefanie Milam
(stefanie.n.milam at nasa.gov).

1. Improve discovery and access for all SMD data for immediate
   benefit to science data users and to improve the overall user
   experience

2. Identify large-scale and cross-disciplinary/division science
   users and use cases to inform future science data system 
   capabilities

[NASA] FUNDING OPPORTUNITY COOPERATIVE AGREEMENT NOTICE (CAN) SOLAR
SYSTEM EXPLORATION RESEARCH VIRTUAL INSTITUTE (SSERVI)

SSERVI CAN-3 NNH18ZDA018C invites the submission of multi-institutional
team-based proposals for research as participating members of the Solar
System Exploration Research Virtual Institute (SSERVI). Proposals must
clearly articulate an innovative research program addressing basic
and/or applied research fundamental to understanding the nature of the
Moon, Near Earth Asteroids (NEAs), the Martian moons Phobos and Deimos,
and the near space environments of these bodies, to enable eventual
human exploration of these destinations.

While SSERVI will continue to support research addressing
potential human exploration destinations, given 1) the Administration's
focus on returning to the Moon and 2) opportunities to be provided by
the commercial lunar industry, proposals that address these near-term
lunar needs and opportunities will be given preference. Proposed
research that complements current CAN-2 Institute Teams, and/or
addresses important research areas not currently covered in the
Institute, will be given strong consideration; see:

http://sservi.nasa.gov/sserviteams/

Step-1 proposals: 11:59 PM Eastern Time October 19, 2018
Step-2 proposals: 11:59 PM Eastern Time December 18, 2018

Email questions no later than 14 calendar days prior to the Step-2
proposal due date to: HQ-SSERVI@mail.nasa.gov

TENURE-TRACK FACULTY POSITION IN PLANETARY SCIENCE AT WESTERN
WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY

The Department of Physics/Astronomy and the Geology Department at
Western Washington University invite applications for a tenure-track
assistant professor of planetary science, starting September 2019.
Teaching assignments will be focused in Geophysics, a program shared
between the departments. We seek applicants whose research examines the
role of physical processes in planet formation and evolution, planetary
interiors, surfaces, atmospheres and/or magnetospheres, small bodies,
solar system dynamics, or related topics. The preferred candidate will
be expected to develop and maintain a vigorous research program that
complements existing strengths in remote sensing, planetary geology,
seismology, magnetism, and tectonics, to engage students in this
research, and to teach undergraduate courses at all levels, using
student-centered instructional approaches when appropriate. Applicants
must hold a Ph.D. in geophysics, physics, geology, astronomy or closely
related field by time of appointment.
