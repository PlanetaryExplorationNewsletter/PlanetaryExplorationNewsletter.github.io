2019 PIERAZZO INTERNATIONAL STUDENT TRAVEL AWARD

Application deadline: 9 PM MST, November 29, 2018

Awards will be announced on or before December 10, 2018

This award is established by the Planetary Science Institute in memory
of Senior Scientist Betty Pierazzo to support and encourage graduate
students to build international collaborations and relationships in
planetary science. Two awards will be made each year, contingent upon
there being meritorious applications. One will be awarded to a
graduate student working on his or her Ph.D. at an institution within
the U.S. This is to support travel to a planetary science related
meeting (conferences and workshops) outside of the U.S. The second
award will be to a graduate student working on his or her Ph.D. at an
institution outside of the U.S. This is to support travel to a
planetary science related meeting within the U.S. These include
general meetings that have planetary-focused sessions such as the AGU,
GSA, EGU and IAG.

The award will consist of a certificate and up to $2000US.

including planetary atmospheres, interiors, surfaces, formation, and
environments, and including research programs that are observational
or theoretical in nature. The NMSU Astronomy Department is committed
to creating an environment that affirms and supports diversity across
a variety of axes, including ethnicity, race, class, ability, gender
identity and expression. We particularly welcome applicants who can
contribute to such an environment through their scholarship, teaching,
mentoring, and professional service. For more details, please see the 
job ad at:

PLANETARY SCIENCES TENURE-TRACK FACULTY POSITION AT CALTECH

The Division of Geological and Planetary Sciences at the California
Institute of Technology is seeking outstanding applicants for a
tenure-track faculty position in planetary science at the assistant
professor level. We are seeking highly qualified candidates who are
committed to a career in research and teaching. We are especially
interested in individuals whose research complements that in the
Division, which covers the full spectrum of the earth and planetary
sciences. We are particularly interested in applicants with solar
system-focused research programs in planetary geophysics/geology,
planetary atmospheric sciences, or small bodies research; but those in
other sub-disciplines will be considered. For further information or
to apply, please see:

AMAZONIAN MARS: CLIMATE AND PROCESSES - NOTICE OF SPECIAL ISSUE IN
PLANETARY AND SPACE SCIENCE

A special issue of Planetary and Space Science seeks to assemble
papers describing our current understanding of the climate and
planetary processes occurring on Mars during the Amazonian period, the
most recent 3 Ga of Martian history which includes the present-day.
The papers presented in this special issue will outline recent results
that advance our understanding of the Amazonian Climate, as well as
reviews of our current understanding of key cycles and trends through
the Amazonian that have left geologic and atmospheric records. If you
are currently working on a paper relevant to the Amazonian period of
Mars, including present-day results from spacecraft currently or
recently operating on Mars, we invite you to submit to the special 
issue.

Submitted papers must describe original research which is neither
published nor currently under review by other journals. Guidelines for
preparation of manuscripts can be found at: 

https://www.elsevier.com/journals/planetary-and-space-science/0032-
0633/guide-for-authors

For more information, please contact John Moores at jmoores@yorku.ca

Paper submission Deadline: February 28th, 2019 
Acceptances anticipated: September 30th, 2019 
Publication expected: November 1st, 2019

Manuscripts and any supplementary material should be submitted
through the Elsevier EVISE system at:

[NASA] SMD RESEARCH OPPORTUNITIES FOR GRADUATE STUDENTS UPDATE

Since 2007, SMD's four science divisions have supported graduate
student-initiated research through the NASA Earth and Space Science
Fellowships (NESSF). This year, however, NASA's Science Mission
Directorate (SMD) is inviting proposals for graduate student research
via a new solicitation entitled "Future Investigators in NASA Earth
and Space Science and Technology" (FINESST) NNH19ZDA005K.

No currently funded NESSF awards will be impacted by the transition to
the new solicitation and universities should continue to request
funding on behalf of existing NESSF grants via the NESSF19R
solicitation.

FINESST proposals are due 11:59PM Eastern on February 1, 2019 
NESSF19R proposals are due 11:59PM Eastern on March 15, 2019

Send questions by email to: HQ-FINESST@mail.nasa.gov.

FINESST questions and responses, with identifying information removed,
will be posted at:
