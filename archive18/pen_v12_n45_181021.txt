WORKSHOP ON IN SITU EXPLORATION OF THE ICE GIANTS 

February 25-27, 2019 
Laboratoire d'Astrophysique de Marseille, France

Meeting URL: 

https://ice-giant-workshop.lam.fr

Abstract submission deadline: December 31, 2018
Early registration deadline: January 31, 2018
Maximum number of participants: 90

Pre-registration is now open - Please note that attendance is capped
at 90, so please register early!

We are pleased to announce a workshop addressing scientific and
technological topics relevant to the in situ exploration of giant
planet atmospheres, including scientific questions, how to achieve
them, and technological challenges. The workshop will also address
potential mission concepts and international cooperation, with an
emphasis on probe studies of the ice giants in the framework of future
NASA-ESA collaborations.

The Workshop on In Situ Exploration of the Ice Giants will take place
at Laboratoire d'Astrophysique de Marseille in a three-day science
program comprising a mixture of invited reviews, invited and
contributed talks, and posters focusing on the link between ice giant
formation, evolution and atmospheric composition, in situ
instrumentation and instrument technologies, mission concepts, and
exoplanetary systems:

CENTAUR EXPLORATION WORKSHOP: THE ROOTS OF ACTIVITY 

A workshop addressing the scientific importance and space exploration
relevance of active centaurs, with a specific focus on mapping
knowledge gaps and paths forward.

Dates: April 1-3, 2019
Location: Florida Space Institute, University of Central Florida,
Orlando, FL

Pre-registration opens: October 31, 2018
Abstracts/NOIs submission deadline: December 31, 2018
Registration deadline: January 15, 2019
Acceptance notifications: January 31, 2019
Maximum number of participants: 40 (in-situ), 50 (online)

Workshop URL: 

https://cew2019.arc.nasa.gov/

The workshop's impetus is two-fold: Advance our understanding of how
small bodies originate, evolve and become active beyond Jupiter's
orbit; Planning of exploration strategies - Both Earth-based
observations and Space-based measurements - aimed at representative
objects of the Centaur population.

Discussion topics will be related to understanding specific properties
and population trends following: Structure, composition, dynamics,
activity behavior. We strongly encourage the participation of early
career researchers (including graduate students and postdoctoral
researchers). We aim for the workshop to result in a white paper
(state-of-the-art, prioritized knowledge gaps, characterization and
exploration pathways) and a plan for a multi-wavelength observing
campaign.

UPDATED COMMUNITY WHITE PAPER ON THE CASE FOR LANDED MERCURY SCIENCE

Dear Colleagues,

With the successful launch of the ESA-JAXA BepiColombo mission to the
innermost planet, an updated version of the community White Paper on
the case for landed Mercury science has been posted on the LPI
website:

https://www.lpi.usra.edu/NASA-academies-resources/White-Paper-Landed-
Mercury-Science.pdf.

This updated version contains a list of 67 signatories, demonstrating
the strong community interest in considering options for in situ
Mercury science.

Thank you for your support for the continued exploration of Mercury!

GRADUATE AND POSTDOCTORAL OPPORTUNITIES IN PLANETARY SURFACE PROCESSES
AT STANFORD UNIVERSITY

Prospective graduate students and postdoctoral scholars interested in
planetary surface processes are invited to apply to join the group of
Dr. Mathieu Lapotre in the Department of Geological Sciences at
Stanford, for a start date in the fall of 2019. The research group
will focus on utilizing the diverse planetary bodies of the Solar
System as full scale experiments to develop and test our quantitative
understanding of surface processes, and deciphering the hydrologic and
climate histories of planets (including Earth) through the lens of
surface processes.

Prospective graduate students should demonstrate strong quantitative
skills and motivation to apply concepts of geomorphology,
sedimentology, and/or spectroscopy to the study of planetary surfaces
and rocks. The next application deadline to the department's graduate
program is January 8, 2019.

Prospective postdoctoral scholars should demonstrate expertise in any
field that is relevant to the study of planetary surface processes.
Candidates with expertise in techniques that are not traditionally
utilized in planetary geology but have the potential to bring new
light to our understanding of the Solar System (e.g., machine
learning, etc.) are encouraged to apply.

Please contact Dr. Lapotre at mlapotre@stanford.edu with any questions.

init&solId=%7b2D390C4D-39F9-E880-34C8-C07DC523698E%7d&path=closedPast

This ROSES element invites proposals for complete, Principal 
Investigator led science instrument and technology investigations. The
term "complete" encompasses all of the investigation phases including
project initiation, payload preparation, payload integration, payload
operations, scientific and engineering analysis of the mission data,
publication of results, and final dissemination of the data including
delivery to NASA's archive.

This call is specifically geared towards small payloads that can be
ready quickly in order to meet the immediate need for payloads for
early Commercial Lunar Payload Services flights. We are interested in
flight spares, engineering models, modified off-the-shelf payloads,
student hardware or any other hardware that can credibly meet the
aggressive timeline required. Future calls for lunar payloads will
occur at regular intervals for later missions. We anticipate that the
next call will be released in approximately one year.

Mandatory Step-1 proposals are due November 19, 2018, and the due date
for Step-2 proposals is January 17, 2019.

Questions concerning this program element may be directed to Sarah
Noble at Sarah.Noble-1@nasa.gov.
