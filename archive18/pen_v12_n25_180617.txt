[NASA] REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ON THE AVAILABILITY OF POTENTIAL LUNAR
PAYLOADS

NASA's Science Mission Directorate has released a Request for
Information (RFI) to assess availability of potential lunar payloads.
NASA has recently released a draft RFP for Commercial Lunar Payload
Services to provide end-to-end services for payloads to the lunar
surface; this RFI is seeking information about potential payloads for
these landers. Responses to this RFI are sought broadly from U.S.
industry, universities, non-profit organizations, NASA centers, and
other U.S. government agencies, and will be used by NASA to further
inform planning and acquisition strategy development.

To be ready for launches as early as 2019, NASA is requesting
information as to the availability of existing hardware that can be
used for flight with little to no payload development necessary.
Existing hardware that respondents should consider in responding to
this RFI include, but are not limited to: engineering models, flight
spares, modified off-the-shelf instruments, etc.

Responses to this RFI are due via NSPIRES by June 27, 2018. Full text
of the RFI, including instructions for submitting a response, can be
accessed at:

https://nspires.nasaprs.com/external/solicitations/summary!init.do?
solId=%7b929BA1D5-2A48-F7FE-261A-BD878F3338F9%7d&path=open

Questions regarding this RFI may be addressed to Dr. Sarah Noble,
HQ-LunarPayloadRFI@mail.nasa.gov.

[NASA] DRAFT COOPERATIVE AGREEMENT NOTICE FOR NEW SSERVI TEAMS RELEASED

NASA, through the release of a Cooperative Agreement Notice (CAN), is
announcing an opportunity for the submission of multi-institutional
team-based proposals for research as participating members of the Solar
System Exploration Research Virtual Institute (SSERVI). Proposals must
clearly articulate an innovative research program addressing basic
and/or applied research fundamental to understanding the nature of the
Moon, Near Earth Asteroids (NEAs), the Martian moons Phobos and Deimos,
and the near space environments of these bodies, to enable eventual
human exploration of these destinations.

Although SSERVI will continue to support research addressing all of
these potential human exploration destinations, in light of the
administration's focus on returning to the Moon, as well as the
near-term opportunities that will be provided by the burgeoning
commercial lunar industry, proposals which address these near-term
lunar needs and opportunities will be given preference. Proposed
research that complements current CAN-2 Institute Teams, and/or
addresses important research areas not currently covered in the
Institute, will be given strong consideration 
(http://sservi.nasa.gov/sserviteams/).

Comments on this DRAFT CAN are to be submitted by July 3, 2018 via
email to HQ-SSERVI@mail.nasa.gov.

FALL AGU SPECIAL SESSION P011 - COMPARATIVE PLANETOLOGY AND THE SOLAR
SYSTEM AS A GATEWAY TO THE EXOPLANETS

Session Description: Comparative planetology is the study of planetary
processes, their manifestations, and their effects on multiple bodies.
The discipline often uses Earth as a baseline to understand the
evolutionary pathways, similarities, and differences between the
planets orbiting our Sun, but nearly every planet within our own solar
system provides a unique point study or baseline for different classes
of exoplanets around other stars.

The study of the rocky worlds of our inner solar system, the Jovian
giants, the ice giants, and the ice-world dwarfs and moons of the outer
system each give us context, and improve our understanding of the
distant condensed signals we receive from the different methods of
exoplanet detection.

This special session will explore what the study of our own, more
accessible planets can bring to the observations, analysis, and
modeling of planets around other stars.

Session Conveners: Noam Izenberg and Kathy Mandt, Applied Physics
Laboratory

FALL AGU SPECIAL SESSION P060 - VENUS: THE ORIGIN AND FATE OF EARTHLIKE
PLANETS? BIG QUESTIONS OF THE WORLD NEXT DOOR

Session Description: Venus records the origin and fate of habitable
planets in our solar system and beyond, but fundamental questions
remain about Earth's Sister Planet from the rate of current volcanism,
to the dominant form of tectonics, to the nature of atmospheric
processes. Evidence suggests early Venus sustained liquid surface
water, but its past and possibly present habitability are open
questions. Recent Venus missions focusing on atmospheric processes have
revealed a trove of information about Venusian atmosphere circulation
and cloud dynamics, but questions about the deep atmosphere, surface,
and interior and their interactions over time - remain unanswered.

This session focuses on the current state of knowledge of Venus
atmosphere including escape, circulation, clouds, habitability, deep
atmosphere and chemistry; surface processes including volcanism and
tectonics; and interior processes. Abstracts are encouraged to explore
questions in need of new data, and the nature of those data.

FALL AGU SPECIAL SESSION P054 - THE USE OF ANALOG ENVIRONMENTS IN
PREPARING FOR THE EXPLORATION AND CHARACTERIZATION OF PLANETARY
SURFACES

AGU Fall Meeting Session Announcement:

P054: The Use of Analog Environments in Preparing for the Exploration
and Characterization of Planetary Surfaces

https://agu.confex.com/agu/fm18/prelim.cgi/Session/49542

It has long been established that terrestrial analog environments are
useful in preparing for future planetary surface exploration. Analog
sites provide a platform for understanding Solar System processes,
technology and procedure development for future exploration, and
astronaut crew training. This session will focus on this wide range of
uses for terrestrial analog sites in preparation for the exploration of
other planetary surfaces. Remote sensing, modeling, field, and
laboratory studies are welcome, as are studies that focus on the human
or robotic exploration of other planetary bodies. Scientific,
operational, and technologic abstracts are encouraged.

Please note that this session is formatted as an alternate style
session so we are soliciting both 5-minute and 15-minute talks.

Please contact the primary convener at kelsey.e.young@nasa.gov with any
questions. The abstract submission site is now open and the deadline
for all submissions is Wednesday, 1 August 23:59 EDT.
