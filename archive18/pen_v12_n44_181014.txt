HERA MISSION WORKSHOP 

15-16 November 2018
Natural History Museum, Berlin (Germany) 

Hera is ESA's contribution to the Asteroid Impact Deflection Assessment
international cooperation, targeting the deflection demonstration of a
hazardous NEA. Hera will also be the first in-depth investigation of a
binary asteroid and will perform relevant measurements for the
preparation of asteroid resources utilisation. The Hera workshop is
open to the whole small body community as well as industry interested
in innovative small deep-space missions.

DPS WORKSHOP ON KUIPER-BELT/PLUTO FUTURE MISSIONS

Title: Future Pluto and Kuiper Belt Missions: The View from 2018
Friday, 26 October, 12:00 pm - 1:30 pm
Room 301 B - DPS Conference Venue, Knoxville TN
 
Description:

The Kuiper Belt (KB) is a scientific treasure trove consisting of
comets, planetesimals, and small planets like Pluto. Since its
discovery in the early 1990s, the KB has yielded fundamental insights
into planetary accretion, the migration of planets, and the population
structure of our solar system - including the discovery that dwarf
planets like Pluto are common there.
 
The exploration of Pluto by New Horizons in 2015, the first KB dwarf
planet to be explored, revealed a richness of geological, atmospheric,
satellite, and compositional diversity at Pluto that rivals planets
like Mars. The flyby also revealed evidence for Pluto being an actively
evolving world over many spatial and temporal scales including evidence
for an interior ocean, active glaciers, dunes, tectonics, a wide
variety of terrain ages, and a complex atmosphere. Those results,
combined with the heterogeneous colors, surface compositions, and
satellite systems of other KB dwarf planets beg for an ongoing future
in Kuiper Belt exploration.
 
In this workshop we will survey 2018 work on (i) a return to Pluto with
an orbiter, (ii) Centaur missions to study KBOs, and (iii) flyby
missions to other KB dwarf planets. We will review community and
individual scientist work to motivate NASA to fund future studies
leading to the next Decadal Survey.

GSFC RESEARCH ASSOCIATE IN NOBLE GAS ANALYSIS

Applications are now being accepted for a Research Associate to work on
the development of Ar-Ar analysis and dating of geologic samples at
NASA/GSFC. This position may be filled at the postdoctoral level or for
more senior researchers as a visiting scholar. The successful candidate
would join scientists in the Noble Gas Lab to develop the capability
for Ar-Ar geochronology on our multicollector instruments, and use it
to address questions about solar system materials, for example, the
origin of meteorites, the age of aqueous alteration, or other research
of mutual interest. The MNGRL facility comprises two multicollector
magnetic sector mass spectrometers (Nu Noblesse and Thermo Helix) with
various modes of gas extraction (laser and furnace), two in situ
geochronology development projects, and sample examination and
preparation capabilities. Applicants should hold a Ph.D. in geosciences
or a related field and have experience in noble gas analysis of
geologic samples, either terrestrial or extraterrestrial. US
citizenship is not required. Applications are due by November 2, 2018;
package materials and address can be found at

https://cresst2.umd.edu/opportunities/researchopp.html

LSST SOLAR SYSTEM HACKATHON AT DPS

Thursday October 25, 2018 4:00-7:30 pm
Room 200 B-C (Knoxville Convention Center), 50th DPS meeting
Organizers: Meg Schwamb (Gemini Observatory) & David Trilling (NAU)

The main goal of the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) Solar
System Science Collaboration (SSSC)

http://www.lsstsssc.org

is to facilitate the efforts of the planetary community to study the
planets and small body populations residing within our Solar System
using LSST data. LSST will observe over 5 million Main Belt asteroids,
almost 300,000 Jupiter Trojans, over 100,000 NEOs, over 40,000 KBOs,
tens of interstellar objects, and over 10,000 comets. To prepare for
survey cadence decisions and ensure that interesting and novel Solar
System science is achievable with LSST, the SSSC is organizing a
Hackathon at DPS. The aim is spend several hours working intensively on
collaborative projects related to community preparations for when LSST
turns on. Past Hack day experience is not required. Come ready with a
project idea or join someone's pitched project. Programming experience
is not a requirement. This workshop is focused towards SSSC members,
but any DPS attendee is welcome to attend. Please register to reserve a
spot at:

INTERNATIONAL OBSERVE THE MOON NIGHT - OCTOBER 20, 2018

International Observe the Moon Night is an annual worldwide celebration
of our Moon, its connection to planetary science and exploration, and
our cultural and personal connections to our nearest celestial
neighbor. Everyone on Earth is invited to participate by hosting or
participating in an event - or simply looking up and observing the Moon
from wherever you are. Beginning this year, International Observe the
Moon Night presents an opportunity to celebrate the 50th anniversary of
the Apollo program in communities around the world.

The next International Observe the Moon Night is Saturday, October 20.
Go look at the Moon! Invite your family, friends, and neighbors to look
with you. Find an event near you, register your event, or add yourself
to the map as a lunar observer through

http://moon.nasa.gov/observe

Here you will find additional information about International Observe
the Moon Night, resources including an event planning guide, the 2018
Moon map, recommended activities and visualizations, evaluation
materials, and more. You can also join the conversation using
#observethemoon across social media platforms.

International Observe the Moon Night is sponsored by NASA's Lunar
Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) mission, with support from NASA's Solar
System Exploration Research Virtual Institute (SSERVI), the Lunar and
Planetary Institute (LPI), and other partners.

WORKSHOP REMINDER: JUNO AND JUNO-SUPPORTING JUPITER ATMOSPHERIC RESULTS

Sun Oct 21, 2018, 1:00-6:00pm Room 301 B (Knoxville Convention Center)

This is immediately prior to the 50th AAS/DPS meeting, but no DPS
registration is required to attend this meeting.

The workshop is intended to foster collaboration and discussion between
the Juno science team and the Earth-based observation community. We
will have people from the Juno project present mission updates and
members of the Earth-based community present updates on their
observations. The structure of the meeting will be informal in order to
encourage interactions between all participants.

There is no registration required for this workshop, but please send us
an email (fachreddin.tabataba-vakili@jpl.nasa.gov and/or
Glenn.S.Orton@jpl.nasa.gov) if you intend to give a brief talk relating
to Juno or Jupiter. This will help our organization.

We are working on some requests for WebEx participation, but this
capability is not guaranteed at this time.
