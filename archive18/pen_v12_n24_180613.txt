MICHAEL J.S. BELTON - IMAGES AND REMEMBRANCES REQUEST

Mike passed away on Monday, June 4, 2018, in Tucson, Arizona. Just a 
few days earlier he had expressed pleasure upon receiving notice that 
a paper of his was accepted for publication.

A memorial will be held 10:30 AM Saturday, June 30, 2018, at the 
University of Arizona, Kuiper Space Sciences Building, Room 308. In
preparation for this event, we would like to collect images (very 
much appreciated) and stories you may have about Mike and also about 
his work.

Please send them to sykes@psi.edu by Sunday, June 17.

Thank you,
