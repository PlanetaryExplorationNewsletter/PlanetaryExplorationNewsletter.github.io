EDITORIAL: ON THE INSENSITIVE USE IF THE TERM "PLANET" 9 FOR OBJECTS
BEYOND PLUTO

We the undersigned wish to remind our colleagues that the IAU planet 
definition adopted in 2006 has been controversial and is far from 
universally accepted. Given this, and given the incredible 
accomplishment of the discovery of Pluto, the harbinger of the solar 
system's third zone - the Kuiper Belt - by planetary astronomer 
Clyde W. Tombaugh in 1930, we the undersigned believe the use of the 
term "Planet 9" for objects beyond Pluto is insensitive to Professor 
Tombaugh's legacy.

We further believe the use of this term should be discontinued in favor 
of culturally and taxonomically neutral terms for such planets, such as 
Planet X, Planet Next, or Giant Planet Five.

SYMPOSIUM IN CELEBRATION OF MIKE A'HEARN

We will be holding a symposium at the University of Maryland in College 
Park on August 6-8, 2019, in celebration of the contributions that 
Mike A'Hearn made to cometary science.

In Mike's honor, this symposium will focus on results from observations 
of comet 46P/Wirtanen (and the other recent bright comets) to allow the 
compilation of individual studies into a comprehensive understanding of 
the comet.

We encourage comet scientists of all types as well as anyone who knew 
and worked with Mike in any capacity to come and participate in this 
event and to reflect on his legacy.

For additional details on the Wirtanen Observing Campaign and for 
future updates on the symposium, please visit the campaign website:

GSA SESSION T147: MEMORIAL SESSION IN MEMORY OF LAWRENCE A. TAYLOR ON
PLANETARY MANTLES - USING SAMPLES TO EXPLORE EARTH, THE MOON, AND MARS

Please consider submitting an abstract to honor the legacy of the late, 
great, Dr. Larry Taylor, who impacted many of us through his dedication 
to students, post-docs, and early-career scientists as well as delving 
deep to better understand the mantles of our home planet, the Moon and 
Mars.

Session Description: Comparative planetology through the study of 
terrestrial, lunar, and martian mantles was the essence of Prof. 
Taylor's long research career, during which he mentored numerous 
students and post-doctoral researchers, as well as forging many 
international partnerships and collaborations. This session is looking 
for papers that focus on the mantles of the Earth, Moon and Mars and 
in doing so, celebrate the life and legacy of Larry Taylor.

Abstract deadline: Tuesday, August 14, 11:59 pm (Pacific)

Conveners:

Clive R. Neal (University of Notre Dame)
Amy L. Fagan (Western Carolina University)
Molly C. McCanta (University of Tennessee, Knoxville)
Bradley J. Thomson (University of Tennessee, Knoxville)

Co-sponsored by GSA Planetary Geology Division; GSA Geophysics and 
Geodynamics Division

MARS SCIENCE LABORATORY RELEASE 18

The NASA Planetary Data System announces the 18th release of data from
the Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) mission, covering data acquired from
Sol 1870 through Sol 2003 (November 8, 2017, to March 26, 2018).

This release consists of raw and derived data sets from the following
instruments:

APXS
ChemCam
CheMin
DAN
Hazcam
MAHLI
MARDI
Mastcam
Navcam
PLACES
RAD
REMS
SAM
SPICE

To access the above data, please visit the following link:

https://pds.nasa.gov/datasearch/subscription-service/SS-20180801.shtml

Links to all MSL data sets may be found on the PDS Geosciences Node web
site: 

http://pds-geosciences.wustl.edu/missions/msl 

The data may also be reached from the main PDS home page: 

https://pds.nasa.gov 

MSL data are archived at the PDS Atmospheres, Planetary Plasma 
Interactions (PPI), Geosciences, Imaging, and Navigation and Ancillary 
Information Facility (NAIF) Nodes.

PDS offers two services for searching the MSL archives.

The Planetary Image Atlas at the Imaging Node allows selection of MSL
image data by specific search criteria:

http://pds-imaging.jpl.nasa.gov/search

The MSL Analyst's Notebook at the Geosciences Node allows searching and
downloading of all MSL data in the context of mission events:

This month's topic is "Measuring Cross-Bed Geometry in Upper Aeolis
Mons, Gale Crater, Mars", contributed by Ryan B. Anderson, 
Astrogeology Science Center, United States Geological Survey.

[NASA] LODGING WAIVER FOR THE 50TH DPS

SMD has issued a waiver for grantees attending Division for Planetary 
Sciences (DPS) 50th Annual Meeting allowing them to be reimbursed out 
of their grants for their actual lodging costs (within limits) in 
excess of the GSA $98 per night for Knoxville. This waiver does not 
supersede the travel policy of your institution if it is more 
restrictive. For more information see:

THE ART OF PLANETARY SCIENCE AT DPS

Submissions are open for The Art of Planetary Science exhibition at the 
2018 DPS Meeting, from October 21-25th in Knoxville, TN. All types and 
levels of artists and scientists are encouraged to submit. We accept 
both physical and digital works. Scientists are especially encouraged 
to submit art created from research or spacecraft data, or containing 
scientific information or ideas. This could even include photos from 
field/lab work or spruced up publication figures. The exhibition will 
serve as a space to reflect on the beauty of our universe, and our 
role in discovery and exploration.

TAPS is a science-art outreach effort founded in 2013 by graduate 
students at the University of Arizona's Lunar and Planetary 
Laboratory. Events are organized by volunteers across multiple 
institutions to engage the public in our work and celebrate the beauty 
of science. Information and photos can be found at the website below.

Submission deadline: September 21, 2018

Guidelines and submission form:
