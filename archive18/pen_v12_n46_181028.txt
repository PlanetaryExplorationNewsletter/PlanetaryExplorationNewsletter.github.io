GRADUATE STUDENT RESEARCH OPPORTUNITIES IN PLANETARY SCIENCE AT TULANE
UNIVERSITY

Highly motivated students with an interest in pursuing graduate studies
in planetary science are encouraged to apply to the Department of Earth
and Environmental Sciences at Tulane University. The Planetary Science
Research Group focuses on studying the geomorphology, and surfaces
processes and properties of terrestrial planetary bodies. Potential
research topics include analysis of ancient terrains on Venus and the
polar ice deposits on Mars. Students will gain experience integrating
multiple orbital datasets using Geographical Information Systems (e.g.,
ArcGIS). For more information, please contact Dr. Jennifer Whitten
(jwhitten1@tulane.edu) or see:

http://whitten.wp.tulane.edu/

Applications are due December 31, 2018

PH.D. POSITION IN EXPERIMENTAL PLANETARY SCIENCE

The Space Research and Planetology Division at the University of Bern,
Switzerland, has an opening for a Ph.D. student position in
experimental planetary science. The successful candidate will prepare
and examine analogue samples for the surfaces of the Moon and Mercury
and will put the experimental results into the general context of the
surfaces and tenuous atmospheres of the Moon and Mercury.
 
A detailed description can be found at:

FACULTY POSITION IN ISOTOPE GEOCHEMISTRY AT UTK

The Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences, University of
Tennessee, Knoxville, invites applications for a nine-month,
tenure-line position in Isotope Geochemistry and Geochemistry to be
hired at the rank of Associate Professor.

The successful candidate will develop a program of externally funded
research in isotope geochemistry and geochemistry that includes
supervision of undergraduate and graduate students, post-doctoral
researchers, and technical staff. The candidate will provide primary
oversight of a newly created ICP-MS core facility, which will include
quadrupole and multicollector ICP-MS instruments, a laser ablation
system, and a clean laboratory housed in the Department of Earth and
Planetary Sciences. All laboratory spaces are new and purpose-built for
the core facility, with significant university resources available for
equipment purchase.

Applicants must hold a Ph.D. (or equivalent) degree in solid-earth
geoscience or a related discipline, and demonstrate excellence and
innovation through publications and grants/contracts in isotope
geochemistry (radiogenic and/or non-traditional stable isotope) or
geochemistry, with the capacity to lead research in isotope
geochemistry. Full details and application instructions can be found
at:

EGU SESSION: SPACE ENVIRONMENTS OF UNMAGNETIZED OR WEAKLY MAGNETIZED
SOLAR SYSTEM BODIES AND THE EFFECTS OF SPACE WEATHER ON THESE SYSTEMS

We are pleased to announce that the abstract submission is now open for
the EGU 2019 meeting that will take place in Vienna (Austria) on 7-12
April 2019. We would like to encourage to submit an abstract to our
session, PS4.2: "Space environments of unmagnetized or weakly
magnetized solar system bodies and the effects of space weather on
these systems"

The session will focus on the analysis of ionospheres and
magnetospheres of weakly magnetized bodies with substantial atmospheres
(e.g. Mars, Venus, Titan, Pluto and comets), and how each body reacts
to disturbances caused by solar activities, interplanetary conditions,
or parent magnetospheric environments (e.g. solar flares, coronal mass
ejections and solar energetic particles), sharing similarities with
their magnetized counterparts but with scientifically important
differences. This session invites abstracts concerning remote and
in-situ data analysis, modeling studies, comparative studies,
instrumentation and mission concepts for weakly magnetized solar system
bodies. More information can be found at:

https://meetingorganizer.copernicus.org/EGU2019/session/31959

Deadline: 10 January 2019

We look forward to welcoming you!
 
Kind regards,
Martin Volwerk, Charlotte Goetz, Niklas Edberg, Beatriz Sanchez-Cano

OPEN POSITION IN PLANETARY GEOLOGY

The University of Idaho seeks a creative and dynamic person for a
Tenured Track Planetary Science Position who will contribute to our
department's strong research core in lithosphere and surface processes
and to our college's growing interdisciplinary planetary science
emphasis area. Areas of specialization from the broader theme of
planetary sciences are open, but we are particularly interested in
candidates whose field-based research examines early Earth surface
processes including either planetary crustal dynamics or the appearance
and evolution of early life forms as documented in the rock record.

The Inland Northwest is a spectacular place to establish an academic
career in geological sciences, especially for someone looking to
integrate field-based teaching and research. Our department's location
in north-central Idaho provides access to a wide array of unique
geological settings for teaching and research, including a number of
planetary analog study sites. Close proximity to Washington State
University allows for inter-departmental collaboration and sharing of
research facilities.
