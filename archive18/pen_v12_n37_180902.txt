IN MEMORIAM: PAUL SPUDIS (1952-2018)

We are very sad to have to announce the passing of Dr. Paul Spudis.
Paul was a distinguished lunar and planetary scientist and a proponent
of the return of humans to Moon, using local resources to enable
long-duration exploration. His research included understanding the
geology and mechanics of impact basins and craters, the origin and
evolution of the lunar crust, and volcanic processes on the Earth and
planets. In addition to his lunar research, Paul worked on a number of
missions. These included being deputy leader of the science team for
the Clementine mission to the Moon in 1994 and leading the Mini-SAR
radar that flew on the Indian Chandrayaan-1 lunar orbiter. Paul served
on many panels and committees, the most important of which was in 2004
when he was called on by President G. W. Bush to be a member of the
prestigious Presidential Commission on the Implementation of U.S. Space
Exploration Policy. This was a reprise of his role as a member of the
Exploration Science Planning Synthesis Group in 1990-1991 commissioned
by President G.H.W. Bush.

His passing is a great loss to the lunar and planetary geoscience
community.

STAFF SCIENTIST POSITION: JET PROPULSION LABORATORY

The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology,
invites applications for a Staff Scientist position in areas relevant
to understanding Ocean Worlds. The position is to conduct Ocean
Worlds-related scientific research within the fields of Geochemistry
and Astrobiology. It is expected that the successful candidate will
develop an independently funded research program and will pursue new
mission and/or instrument opportunities focusing on Ocean World
exploration.

The position requires a Ph.D. in planetary science, or related
scientific discipline, along with demonstrated experience in
conceiving, defining, and conducting independent scientific research,
with a strong interest in applying those efforts to problems related to
Ocean Worlds exploration. The successful candidate will have a
demonstrated professional reputation as a productive researcher with a
track record of publications in peer-reviewed journals.

For a full description, please visit 

https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/opportunities/experienced/ 

(Job ID 2018-9596). Applications received by September 30, 2018, will
receive full consideration.

TENURE-TRACK FACULTY POSITION IN GEOCHEMISTRY

The Department of Earth, Environmental and Planetary Sciences at Brown
University invites applications for a tenure-track faculty appointment
in geochemistry. Any analytical, experimental and theoretical/
computational approach to understanding the origin and chemical
evolution of the Earth and planets will be considered. Some examples
include, but are not limited to, cosmochemistry, planetary petrology,
non-traditional stable isotope geochemistry, early Earth evolution,
volcanology, and interactions of planetary materials with hydrospheres
and atmospheres. Preference will be given to candidates whose strengths
complement departmental research expertise in Geochemistry and
Petrology, Planetary Geoscience, Geophysics, and Climate and
Environment. We seek scientists whose research integrates field
observations, geochemical analyses, experimental studies, and
geochemical theory and/or modeling. We are interested in scientists
whose research transcends traditional boundaries in geochemistry, such
as between high-temperature and low-temperature geochemistry,
geochemistry and geophysics, and terrestrial and planetary. The
successful candidate will maintain an active, externally funded
research program and enjoy a commitment to teaching at both
undergraduate and graduate levels. 

Inquiries: DEEPS@Brown.edu

Applications received by November 1, 2018 will receive full
consideration. The start date is July 1, 2019.

EXOPLANET SCIENCE STRATEGY PUBLIC BRIEFING AND WEBCAST

September 5, 2018 at 1pm EDT

At the request of NASA, the National Academies of Sciences,
Engineering, and Medicine appointed a committee to develop a science
strategy for the study of extrasolar planets and survey the status of
the field in preparation for the next decadal survey. We invite you to
join us for a public briefing and webcast on September 5, 2018 from
1-2pm EDT where study committee chairs David Charbonneau and Scott
Gaudi will discuss the report's recommendations and take questions from
the audience.

Register to attend in person (in Washington, DC) or online:

ANNOUNCEMENT OF DPS WORKSHOP ON PROPOSAL WRITING

The success of scientists depends upon their ability to obtain
funding. Using Research Opportunities in Space and Earth Sciences
(ROSES) from NASA as a primary example, this workshop will focus on
teaching the audience key points to writing a successful proposal.

Topics:
8:00-8:15  Introduction
8:15-9:15  Proposal lifecycle, guidance on writing for specific
audiences, compliance checklist
9:15-9:30  Break
9:30-10:30  Evaluation criteria, the review process, programmatic
balance, debriefs and appeals, and making changes to address review
concerns
10:30-11:00  General wrap up and group Q&A
11:00-11:30  One-on-One Q&A as needed.

The workshop will be Friday, October 26th from 8:00-11:30 AM in room
301B. Participants should sign up at:

https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/MF3YQNR

by October 15th to ensure they receive all handouts and supplies,
however, last minute additions will be welcomed so long as space
remains in the room. Participants are encouraged to bring along
previous proposal materials and reviews to go through within the group
or for one-on-one Q&A during the workshop. 

Please contact Dr. Christina Richey (christina.r.richey@jpl.nasa.gov
prior to 9/18, christina.r.richey@jpl.caltech.edu after 9/18) with any
questions.

PH.D. POSITION IN ASTROCHEMISTRY, STAR AND PLANET FORMATION

A full-time, 4-year Ph.D. position in astrochemistry, star and planet
formation is open at the Center for Space and Habitability (CSH),
Universitaet Bern. Gross salary of 47,000 - 50,000CHF per year (as set
by the SNSF). A full package of social benefits is included. Starting
date: between November 1st, 2018 and April 30th, 2019.

Under the guidance of Dr. Maria Drozdovskaya, a Ph.D. research project
is available, which aims to understand the chemical processes that link
the different stages of star and planet formation, and that determine
the composition of forming cometary and planetary embryos. The insights
gained during this project will enhance our understanding of the early
history of our Solar System.

Primary features of the project include theoretical physicochemical
modelling work; possibility of working with observational data from,
e.g., ALMA, JWST; active participation in the scientific life of the
CSH; exposure to the largest group of planetary scientists in the world
via associate membership in the NCCR PlanetS; sufficient funds for
participation in national and international conferences, and
collaborator visits.
