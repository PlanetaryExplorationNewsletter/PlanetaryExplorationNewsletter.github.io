GEOSCIENCES SPECIAL ISSUE: RECENT ADVANCES IN LUNAR STUDIES

Dear Colleagues,

The journal Geosciences is accepting papers for a Special Issue related
to recent advances in studies of the Moon. The deadline has been
extended until the end of September 2018.

Since the Apollo era, sample studies, remote analyses, and dynamical
models continue to tease out details related to the Moon's formation
and evolution. Additionally, the international lunar science community
is eager to continue its presence on the Moon, as evidenced by recent,
upcoming, and future lunar missions. All of these topics are of great
interest to the broader geoscience community.

The Special Issue welcomes papers that describe studies related to any
of the above topics and will be an outlet for rapid, accessible, and
peer-reviewed publications. The editors especially welcome papers from
young investigators.

Additional details are available at:

AGU SESSION DI019: THE ARCHEAN EARTH AND ITS VENUSIAN ANALOG

Is Venus a once and future Earth? You are invited to submit abstracts
on interior evolution, subduction, continental curst formation, and
the parameters needed for plate tectonics.

Plate tectonics, continents, the oxygen atmosphere - the beginnings of
Earth as we know it today - began to take shape in the Archean. What
caused Earth to transition to plate tectonics? How was the first step,
subduction, initiated? How is continent formation related? How did the
formation of crust differ? Venus' lithosphere today is hot due to the
greenhouse atmosphere, potentially providing a good analog to
lithospheric conditions on early Earth. Plume-induced subduction
appears to be operating today, yet plate tectonics is absent. Large,
highly deformed plateaus could be analogs of continents. What caused
these twin planets to evolve to such different end members? Is the
interior of Venus dry, and is that the reason it lacks plate tectonics?
Or is temperature the key factor? Studies of planetary evolution,
convection, crust formation, geologic processes, and links between
interior, surface and atmosphere on Venus and Earth are invited.

AGU SESSION P006: CARBON ACROSS THE SOLAR SYSTEM

We invite you to submit an abstract to our session on carbon in the
Solar System at the 2018 AGU Fall Meeting in Washington, DC, December
10-14, 2018.

Recent results ranging from the Pluto system, the Saturn system, other
locations beyond 5 AU, all the way to Mercury in the inner Solar
System, and nearly all points in between, raise questions abut the
state of carbon in the Solar System: how do carbonaceous compounds
become weathered in response to thermal processes and irradiation? How
do we recognize carbon compounds and their various weathering products?
The synthesis of these results improves our scientific understanding of
the role of carbon in the Solar System, how it evolves and how to
recognize it. The carbonaceous near-Earth asteroids 162173 Ryugu and
101955 Bennu will be sampled in the next few years; the analyses of
these samples will provide context for the presence of carbon. In this
session, abstracts covering observational, laboratory and modeling work
related to carbon and carbonaceous species on Solar System bodies are
welcome.

AGU SESSION P009: CHASING LIFE WITH A SAMPLE SIZE OF ONE - FROM
UNDERSTANDING THE SIGNS OF LIFE IN EARTH'S ATMOSPHERE THROUGH TIME TO
DETECTING BIOSIGNATURES ON EXOPLANETS

Please consider submitting an abstract to our AGU session on exoplanet
habitability:

Because Earth is the only planet known to harbor life, the search
should start here. From Earth, we can continue to identify potential
biosignatures and ponder the challenges that exist for detecting these
conditions on exoplanets. Using Earth as a first-approximation,
atmospheric climate models of exoplanets are being developed, and
researchers are imagining how those models would be different under
various conditions by incorporating data from exoplanet observations.
We solicit new research in: using remote sensing datasets for Earth as
a reference case, studying the evolution of life's detectability on
Earth, mitigating observational and biosignature detectability
challenges, and assessing how the Earth-model may be expected to change
for a planet formed under different circumstances around another star
(e.g., how increased stellar activity and extreme events may impact
climate, habitability, and the detectability of biosignatures,
especially work that uses Earth-Sun interactions as an analog, for the
present day and early Earth).

AGU SESSION P016: ENCELADUS - A WORLD AWAITING

Section/Focus Group: Planetary Sciences

Though the Cassini mission at Saturn is now over, this long-standing
special session on Saturn's geysering moon, Enceladus - 13 years in
the running - continues. Our goal is to bring together researchers
studying topics in planetary science, microbiology, oceanography,
organic chemistry, astrobiology, and origin of life that are relevant
in understanding the nature of the moon's subsurface ocean and its
extensive south polar plume, and in assessing its biological potential
and the best means to examine it.

As in years past, we will focus on the most recent Enceladus-specific
observational, theoretical and modeling efforts and we encourage
submissions in the above-mentioned areas. Presentations on concepts for
future missions back to Enceladus will also be considered. 

Join us!

Abstract submission:   

https://agu.confex.com/agu/fm18/prelim.cgi/Session/43922 

The Enceladus keyword is 6282. 

The deadline for all submissions is Wednesday, 1 August 23:59 EDT. 

Conveners:

AGU SESSION P020: FROM THE EARTH TO THE MOONS

Hi everyone, just a reminder that AGU abstracts are due August 1!

We'd like to remind you about our session and invite you to consider
submitting your work. It's cross-listed in Planetary Sciences,
Cryosphere, and Ocean Sciences.

Session P020, "From the Earth to the Moons: Unraveling the Geologic,
Oceanographic and Chemical Mysteries of Ice and Ocean Worlds" brings
together studies of ice and ocean worlds (including Earth!) and the
associated geological, geochemical and oceanographic processes that
might contribute to the evolution (habitability included) of ices,
oceans and their interactions.

AGU SESSION P033: PLANET MERCURY - PRESENT UNDERSTANDING AND PROMISE
FOR FUTURE DISCOVERY

Please consider submitting an abstract to the Mercury session at the
2018 AGU Fall Meeting in Washington, DC, December 10-14, 2018.

Our understanding of Mercury's surface, interior, exosphere, and
magnetosphere has been revolutionized by data returned by NASA's
MESSENGER mission. With the launch of the ESA-JAXA BepiColombo dual
spacecraft mission to Mercury in October this year, that understanding
will take another substantial step forward. We solicit contributed
papers on data analysis, laboratory measurements, ground-based
observations, and theoretical developments that build on the current
state of knowledge of Mercury. We also welcome papers on how questions
raised by MESSENGER findings can be addressed by future observations
expected from BepiColombo.

AGU SESSION P040: SATURN'S SEASONALLY EVOLVING ATMOSPHERE DURING THE
CASSINI ERA AND BEYOND

We solicit new research findings about the troposphere and stratosphere
of Saturn. A special focus of our session is the seasonal evolution of
Saturn's atmosphere observed during Cassini's thirteen years in orbit,
up-close observations obtained during Cassini's final orbits, and new
features observed after the end of Cassini. We especially encourage
submissions of Earth-based observations that extend the valuable
temporal coverage beyond Cassini to study the dynamic seasonal
evolution after the solstice of 2017. In addition, we solicit long-term
monitoring using ground- and space-based telescopes as well as modeling
and theoretical presentations that address these observational
findings. Lastly, we solicit surveys that identify paths to carry the
legacy of the Cassini mission into the future by advocating for new
missions as well as observational and theoretical investigations in
preparation for the next Planetary Science Decadal Survey.

Submit here before August 1, 2018, 11:59 PM EDT:

ROSES-18 AMENDMENT 21: NEW OPPORTUNITY IN MARS 2020 RETURNED SAMPLE
SCIENCE PARTICIPATING SCIENTIST PROGRAM

The preparation of a cache of Martian rock and regolith samples for
possible return to Earth via a future mission is a central objective of
the Mars 2020 mission. The Returned Sample Science Participating
Scientist (RSS PS) program seeks individuals whose addition to the
mission's science team will enhance the value of the samples to be
selected, characterized, and cached by the Mars 2020 Rover. The
selected investigators should anticipate the needs of future
investigators who may analyze these samples for a very diverse range of
studies in Earth-based laboratories. Selected RSSPSs will become
members of the Mars 2020 Science Team and are expected to contribute
collaboratively to any and all aspects of the surface science mission.

Mandatory NOIs due by August 24, 2018, and proposals are due by October
24, 2018.

ESA CALL FOR MISSION PROPOSALS

The ESA Director of Science solicits proposals from the scientific
community in ESA Member States for a Fast (F) mission to be launched in
the 2026-2028 timeframe.

This Call for a Fast mission aims at defining a mission of modest size
(wet mass less than 1000 kg) to be launched towards the Sun-Earth L2
Lagrange point as a co-passenger to the ARIEL M mission, or possibly
the PLATO M mission. From L2 the mission should reach its target orbit
or destination with its own propulsion system.

The Call is open to all areas of space science. Any scientific goal and
spacecraft technical configuration will be considered, including
missions aiming at multi-point scientific measurements, for example,
Near-Earth Objects or Main Belt comets, considered in the studies
performed by ESA following the Call for New Science Ideas issued in
2016.

Full details of this Call, including all documentation, are on the
dedicated web page at:

ON THE INSENSITIVE USE OF THE TERM "PLANET 9" FOR OBJECTS BEYOND PLUTO

We the undersigned wish to remind our colleagues that the IAU planet
definition adopted in 2006 has been controversial and is far from
universally accepted. Given this, and given the incredible
accomplishment of the discovery of Pluto, the harbinger of the solar
system's third zone - the Kuiper Belt - by planetary astronomer Clyde
W. Tombaugh in 1930, we the undersigned believe the use of the term
"Planet 9" for objects beyond Pluto is insensitive to Professor
Tombaugh's legacy.

We further believe the use of this term should be discontinued in favor
of culturally and taxonomically neutral terms for such planets, such as
Planet X, Planet Next, or Giant Planet Five.
