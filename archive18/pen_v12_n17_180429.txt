EPSC SESSION: POST-DIFFERENTIATION MAGMATISM ON THE MOON: CURRENT
INSIGHTS ON LUNAR VOLCANISM

European Planetary Science Congress (EPSC) 2018
Berlin, Germany
16-21 September 2018

Deadline: 16 May 2018, 13:00 CEST

https://www.epsc2018.eu/home.html

Based on lunar samples (Apollo and Luna missions and meteorites)
volcanism on the Moon occurred from 4.3 to 2.9 Ga. However, remote
sensing data suggest a longer period of volcanic activity to as
recently as 1.2 Ga, or even as young as 0.1 Ga. Samples have suggested
a wide range of compositional magma sources, which are not always well
understood, especially in terms of lunar bulk composition estimates for
the heat-producing elements versus the potentially 3+ Ga of volcanism.
Volcanism on the Moon occurred mostly in two main versions: flows of
low-viscosity lavas and gas-charged fire-fountain eruptions. In
addition, new orbital data indicate the presence of silica-rich
volcanic domes and pyroclastic deposits. Understanding the melting,
crystallization, and ascent of these magmas is critical to enable
better assessment on the role of volatiles in melting and eruption.

Looking forward to meet you in Berlin!

Co-conveners:V. Assis Fernandes, B. Bultel , C. Neal and N. Zellner

The abundance, distribution, history and transport of volatiles on the
Moon are important topics for Lunar science and exploration. Several
missions have been flown or are being planned to address questions
related to Lunar volatiles. This session would invite presentations
related to the advancement in understanding of volatiles on the Moon
through data analysis, modeling, and laboratory studies as well as
plans for the future.

SBAG 19 EARLY CAREER OPPORTUNITIES

Early career travel support: We are planning to offer limited U.S.
travel support for early career scientists to participate in the SBAG
meeting, to be held at the University of Maryland in College Park, MD
on June 13-14, 2018. Interested early career scientists (within 3 years
of PhD/MS/BS) should submit a letter and a CV to SBAG Early Career
Secretary Hannah Susorney (hsusorney@eoas.ubc.ca) by COB (5 pm Eastern
time) April 27th, 2018. Included in the letter, which must not exceed 2
pages, should be a demonstration of financial need and an explanation
of how the applicant's work relates to the purposes of the SBAG. The
letter and CV should be combined into a single PDF document for
submission by e-mail attachment. Recipients of travel support will be
expected to give a short presentation (10-15 minutes) of their
SBAG-relevant work at the SBAG 19 meeting.

Lightning Talks: We are providing time on the agenda for early-career
scientists and engineers present at the meeting to introduce themselves
and their research to the community. The talks will be 3 minutes each.
If you are interested in giving a lightning talk, please contact the
early-career secretary Hannah Susorney (hsusorney@eoas.ubc.ca).

FINAL LANDING SITE WORKSHOP FOR MARS 2020

The fourth and final landing site workshop for the Mars 2020 rover
mission will be October 16-18, 2018, in Glendale, CA. The workshop will
focus on the science potential of the three remaining candidate sites
under consideration: Columbia Hills, Jezero Crater, and NE Syrtis.

New analyses of the science potential of the sites and presentations on
potential extended mission targets at each of the final sites are
encouraged. We anticipate that the Mars 2020 Project will provide
detailed mission scenarios for each site that include discussion of
potential exploration targets, observations, and sampling strategies
relative to mission goals and important Mars science described in the
2013-2022 Planetary Science Decadal Survey.

Additional details will be posted this summer at: 

https://marsnext.jpl.nasa.gov/index.cfm 

For those planning to attend in-person and who typically forecast for
conference attendance, please put your forecast into your institution's
system for NCTS# 34492-19 before May 18.

A community assessment will be made at the end of the workshop for the
final three candidate landing sites and will be factored into
subsequent deliberations that will conclude with the Mars 2020 Project
recommendation of the landing site to NASA Headquarters.

POSTDOCTORAL RESEARCH ASSOCIATE IN VENUS OR MARS SCIENCE, WESLEYAN
UNIVERSITY

Wesleyan University Department of Earth and Environmental Sciences,
Planetary Sciences Group is seeking a Postdoctoral Research Associate
for one of two potential projects to work under the direction of Prof.
Martha Gilmore. The funds will be available July 1, 2018 for two
years.

Venus Surface Mineralogy - we seek someone with expertise in
geomorphology, remote sensing and mineralogy to undertake analysis of
radar properties of the Venus surface to constrain the origin and
composition of tessera highlands and the lowland plains materials. We
will also examine chemical changes in relevant minerals exposed to
Venus conditions using a number of analytical techniques.

Mars Geochemistry and Spectroscopy - The project is to create a series
of Mars analogue brines and precipitate them under terrestrial and
martian conditions in a Mars chamber. VNIR spectra of the precipitates
will be collected in situ and compared to data collected by CRISM in
Mars orbit.

The Planetary Sciences Group comprises 6 core faculty, 7 affiliated
faculty and postdocs across the sciences and offers both graduate and
undergraduate planetary curricula.

POSTDOCTORAL POSITION IN COMETARY PLASMA PHYSICS AT IRF IN UPPSALA,
SWEDEN

The Swedish Institute of Space Physics is seeking candidates for a
postdoctoral position in space physics to study the complex dynamics of
a cometary ionosphere. Our group is responsible for one of the plasma
instruments on the Rosetta spacecraft to comet 67P, and we collaborate
closely with other Rosetta teams. In this project, there will also be
collaboration with a team doing particle-in-cell plasma simulations.
The work involves both analysis of Rosetta data and theoretical
modeling. Experience in the analysis of space plasma data is expected,
and experience in relevant theoretical modelling is an advantage.

Candidates should have completed a PhD during 2015 or later. Candidates
planning to obtain their PhD degree no later than September 2018 can
also apply.

The position is available at our Uppsala office for 2 years. At IRF
Uppsala some 20 researchers work on the space plasma mainly around
Earth, Saturn, Mars and comet 67P using data from our own instruments
on Rosetta, Cluster, MMS, Swarm and Cassini as well as other data. The
project is financed by the Swedish National Space Board.
