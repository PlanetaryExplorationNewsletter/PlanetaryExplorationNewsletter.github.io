POSTDOCTORAL POSITION IN PLANETARY SCIENCE AT MIT  
 
The MIT Department of Earth, Atmospheric, and Planetary Sciences
invites applications for a Postdoctoral Scholar to join Professor de
Kleer's planetary astronomy group. The de Kleer group utilizes
cutting-edge astronomical facilities at optical, infrared, and radio
wavelengths to study a diverse array of Solar System topics including
planetary and satellite atmospheres, satellite surfaces and
geophysics, and small bodies. Applicants are sought from a broad range
of research areas within astronomy and planetary science that overlap
with or complement ongoing work in the group, including both Solar
System and extrasolar planets. Observational experience is beneficial
but not required. The successful candidate will have opportunities to
mentor graduate and undergraduate students, and will benefit from the
dynamic and interdisciplinary environment within the EAPS department
and across the Institute.

The appointment starts on or after July 2019 and is initially for one
year, with renewal for up to two additional years. Consideration of
applications will begin on January 10, 2019, and applications will be
considered until the position is filled. Please see the full posting
for more information and for instructions on submitting applications:

EGU 2019 SESSION ON MARS SAMPLE RETURN

Abstract deadline: 10 January 2019
EGU Roland Schlich travel support deadline: 1 December 2018

We would like to draw your attention to our session,
PS1.5/BG7.3/GMPV7.14 Mars Sample Return - A Community Effort for a
Receiving and Curation Facility

NASA is planning to launch Mars 2020, the first of an ambitious
campaign to sample, cache, and return up to 500g of Martian material.
An essential component of the campaign is a receiving and curation
facility that will enable: 1) a broad range of sample processing and
analysis, 2) dynamic space modifications if required, and 3)
preservation of samples and protection of the public. Interacting with
an array of communities is paramount to define what is feasible and
advisable.

We welcome contributions from all of Earth and Planetary science,
curation, and any discipline concerned with handling potentially
hazardous materials. Reflections on the legal and ethical aspects of
dealing with the rise of the private sector as a novel actor in Mars
exploration are also encouraged.

Hope to see you in Vienna!

PDS/IPDA BOOTH AT AGU - PLANETARY DATA DISCOVERY CHALLENGE/TUTORIALS

The Planetary Data System (PDS), and International Planetary Data
Alliance (IPDA) will have a booth (#1447) at the 2018 AGU meeting to
provide support to the scientific community. Booth visitors will be
invited to take the "Planetary Data Discovery Challenge", to find a
NASA planetary data set of interest in the PDS archive. In addition,
there will be scheduled and walk-in training sessions for both
individuals and small groups (up to 4 persons).

Specific training time slots may be reserved at:

http://pds-training.psi.edu

Available topics: 

- Finding PDS Data 
- General training on PDS4 (either for missions or R&A archives) 
- Data Management Plans for Proposers 
- Designing Mission or Project PDS4 Dictionaries 
- Archiving your data: Bring your data and we will get you started.
- Using PDS4 data: How is it different and tools to read the PDS4 
  labels
- PDS4 Tool Training

SSERVI-SPONSORED 'CARBON IN THE SOLAR SYSTEM' DPS PANEL DISCUSSION NOW
ONLINE

Next workshop at AGU, Special Session P13A Monday Dec 10, 1:40-3:40PM

What was the initial composition of our solar nebula and how
have processes experienced by planetesimals and larger bodies led to
the carbon observed in the Solar System today? SSERVI workshops on
these topics aim to stimulate collaborative research on the origin and
evolution of organics and volatiles in our Solar System by joining
together laboratory, observational, and theoretical modeling
researchers. SSERVI TREX team Principal Investigator, Amanda Hendrix,
and Deputy PI Faith Vilas, have organized three workshops on Carbon in
the Solar System. The next one occurs at the AGU meeting, and we
welcome your participation. Add your name to our mailing list for
future activities by contacting SSERVI Chief Scientist, Yvonne
Pendleton (Yvonne.pendleton@nasa.gov).

AGU session topics: interstellar/solar nebula organics, asteroids,
Mars and Mercury with panel discussion on inter-comparisons relevant
to the origin and evolution of carbon.

AOGS 2019 SESSION ANNOUNCEMENT

Dear colleagues,
 
We are pleased to announce a session for the Asia Oceania Geosciences
Society to be held in Singapore from July 28 - August 2, 2019.
 
http://www.asiaoceania.org/aogs2019/public.asp?page=home.htm
 
Abstract deadline: 12 February 2019
 
PS04-SE: Volcanism and Tectonism Across the Solar System
 
The surfaces of terrestrial planets and their satellites have been
largely shaped through volcanic and tectonic processes. Extreme
conditions on outer solar system bodies, such as the Jovian and
Saturnian satellites, result in different types of volcanism and
tectonism. Fracturing and faulting processes mainly affect minor
bodies such as asteroids and small moons, where volcanism and
tectonism have not played an important role. We invite contributions
that cover a wide range of topics including geomorphology and
composition of volcanic deposits, edifices, plumes, volcano-induced
deformation and edifice growth and collapse to tectonic structures,
faulting and fracturing processes, crustal stress and strain analysis,
cryovolcanism, and any study related to planetary endogenic processes.
Studies that relay interactions between planetary interiors, surfaces,
and atmospheres are welcomed. Comparative studies of volcanic or
tectonic systems on Earth with a strong remote sensing component are
encouraged. 

Hope to see you there!
 
Dr Anezina Solomonidou 
Dr Rosaly Lopes
Dr Florian M. Schwandner

LPSC POSTER SESSION: TECHNIQUES IN COLLABORATION AND COMMUNICATION IN
RESEARCH

We invite colleagues to submit abstracts to a special poster session
at LPSC on effective techniques in collaboration and communication in
research and exploration. The aim of this session is share ideas on
methodologies and tools that you use to make communication and
collaboration among colleagues more effective, including techniques
that leverage multiple researchers to produce a science product or
enhance the robustness of a scientific result. The goal is to explore
how we, as a community, can learn to work together more efficiently,
better leverage the different skillsets and areas of expertise that
individuals can bring to a project, and develop effective
collaborations between institutions and groups. Example topics include
how to: Share research tasks, writing, and credit within a research
group; Effectively work together as part of a mission team; Foster
collaboration between separate research groups or institutions; Write
and communicate with remote collaborators across time zones; Use
collaborative analysis or laboratory techniques to enhance science
output

To submit to this session, please indicate the Other category and
include "collaboration" as the description.
