IN MEMORIAM: MICHAEL J. S. BELTON (1934-2018)

Michael J.S. Belton was President of Belton Space Exploration
Initiatives, LLC, and an Emeritus Astronomer at the National Optical
Astronomy Observatory. He was a member of the Mariner 10 team that flew
the first space probe by Mercury and Venus, he helped define what
became the Voyager missions to the outer solar system, and was the
Leader of the Galileo Mission Imaging Science Team. He made fundamental
contributions to cometary science, focusing on understanding the
mechanisms of cometary outbursts, determination of their rotational
states, how cometary activity can be used to probe the nucleus, and the
size-distribution of comets. Belton was a leader of the planetary
science community, most notably chairing the first National Research
Council Decadal Survey of Solar System Exploration. Among the young
astronomers who worked with him on his many projects, Mike Belton was a
mentor who unselfishly encouraged their professional growth. He was an
engaging, interested and positive colleague. He was an out-of-the box
thinker and visionary in the truest sense. He is deeply missed. 

A memorial will be held at 10:30 AM on Saturday, June 30, at the 
University of Arizona Kuiper Space Sciences Building. Go to:

NASA POSTDOCTORAL FELLOWSHIP APPLICATION DEADLINE JULY 1, 2018
 
The NASA Postdoctoral Program offers US and international scientists
the opportunity to advance their research while contributing to NASA's
scientific goals. The NPP supports fundamental science; explores the
undiscovered; promotes intellectual growth; and encourages scientific
connections.

Selected by a competitive peer-review process, NPP Fellows complete
one- to three-year Fellowship appointments that advance NASA's missions
in earth science, heliophysics, planetary science, astrophysics, space
bioscience, aeronautics and engineering, human exploration and space
operations, and astrobiology.

Current NPP research opportunities in planetary science can be viewed
here: 

https://npp.usra.edu/opportunities/?filter_keywords=&filter_fields=145

Applicants must have a Ph.D. or equivalent degree in hand before
beginning the fellowship, but may apply while completing the degree
requirements. U.S. citizens, Lawful Permanent Residents, and foreign
nationals eligible for J-1 status as a Research Scholar may apply.

UPDATED! Stipends now start at $60,000 per year, with supplements for
high cost-of-living areas and for certain academic specialties.
Financial assistance is available for relocation and health insurance,
and $10,000 per year is provided for professional travel.

Applications are accepted three times each year: March 1, July 1, and
November 1.

POSTDOCTORAL POSITION IN EXOPLANET ATMOSPHERES

Lunar and Planetary Laboratory
University of Arizona
Tucson, AZ

The University of Arizona Department of Planetary Sciences/Lunar and
Planetary Laboratory invites applications for a postdoctoral position
to work with Dr. Tommi Koskinen on the escape and evolution of
exoplanet atmospheres. The successful candidate will develop models of
exoplanet upper atmospheres to interpret existing observations and
motivate searches for new atmospheric signatures with current and
future instruments. In addition to working on the interpretation of
observations by the Hubble Space Telescope and ground-based high
resolution data, the candidate will have the opportunity to participate
in the preparation for the NASA Colorado Ultraviolet Transit Experiment
(CUTE).

The Lunar and Planetary Laboratory and the University of Arizona offer
a world-class research program in astronomy, physics and planetary
sciences, including research into atmospheres ranging from exoplanets
to the planets, dwarf planets, satellites and comets in the solar
system. The successful candidate will have the opportunity to interact
and foster collaborations with many talented researchers working at the
university.

Candidates should have a PhD in planetary science, exoplanets or a
related field and experience in numerical modeling. A background in
modeling atmospheres and/or atmospheric escape is an advantage.
Candidates should apply to Job Posting P20545 at:

http://www.uacareers.com

Applications should include a cover letter, CV, a brief statement of
research plans and contact details for two referees.

TESS SCIENCE CONFERENCE I, JULY 29 - AUGUST 2, 2019

The TESS Science Conference I will be the first conference devoted to
results from the NASA TESS Mission. It will focus on discoveries made
with TESS data and their theoretical interpretation, and also on TESS
data analysis and follow-up observations.

The conference will take place on July 29 - August 2, 2019, at the
Kresge Auditorium on MIT campus, Cambridge, MA, USA.

The conference is timed close to the beginning of TESS 2nd year of
operations, when the satellite is scheduled to transition from
surveying the Southern ecliptic hemisphere to the Northern ecliptic
hemisphere. It will be an auspicious time to bring together experts on
all aspects of the mission to discuss the achievements made during the
1st year, as well as highlighting potential improvements and lessons
learned to be implemented in the 2nd year, and possibly also during the
TESS Extended Mission (yet to be funded by NASA).

In the near future, more information about conference will be posted 
at:

http://tess.mit.edu/science/tess-science-conference

We will send out further announcements once we put together the
schedule for registration and abstract submission.
