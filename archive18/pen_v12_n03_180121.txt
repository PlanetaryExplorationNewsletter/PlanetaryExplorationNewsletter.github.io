ROSES-17 AMENDMENT 61: C.19 NFDAP MOVED TO 2018

New Frontiers Data Analysis Program due dates are being delayed and, 
hence, moved from ROSES-2017 to ROSES-2018. The final text and due 
dates for NFDAP in ROSES-2018 will be released on February 14, 2018 
with the ROSES-2018 NRA, but its estimated that the Step-1 due date 
will be in June 2018 and the Step-2 due date in August, 2018. This move 
will not affect this program element's available funds.

DiSanti via email to HQ-NFDAP@mail.nasa.gov.

GEOSCIENCES SPECIAL ISSUE RECENT ADVANCES IN LUNAR STUDIES

Dear Colleagues,

The journal Geosciences is accepting papers for a Special Issue related 
to recent advances in studies of the Moon. Since the Apollo era, sample 
studies, remote analyses, and dynamical models continue to tease out 
details related to the Moon's formation and evolution. Additionally, 
the international lunar science community is eager to continue its 
presence on the Moon, as evidenced by recent, upcoming, and future 
lunar missions. All of these topics are of great interest to the 
broader geoscience community.

The Special Issue welcomes papers that describe studies related to any 
of the above topics and will be an outlet for rapid, accessible, and 
peer-reviewed publications. The editors especially welcome papers from 
young investigators. The deadline for manuscript submissions is 15 June 
2018.

AIDA/DART SPRING 2018 INVESTIGATION TEAM MEETING

April 9, 2018

Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory, Laurel MD

The DART Investigation Team will have a one-day meeting of the 
Investigation Team on 9 April 2018. This meeting will be used to 
discuss the status of DART and the collaborative AIDA project, present 
work done by the Investigation Team during DART's Preliminary Design 
Phase ("Phase B"), and prepare for a possible transition to Final 
Design and Fabrication Phase ("Phase C") later in 2018. The meeting 
will have a single plenary session during which reports from each of 
the five Investigation Working Groups (Modeling and Simulation of 
Impact Outcomes, Remote Observations, Dynamical and Physical 
Properties, Science Proximity Operations, Ejecta Dynamics and 
Evolution) and the Deflection Independent Validation and Verification 
team will be given and discussed. We welcome community interest and 
participation in general discussion, and plan to provide for remote 
access. Registration is required for onsite participants so that we 
can generate a visitor log, but there is no registration fee and no 
abstracts are solicited.

1ST ANNUAL RPI WORKSHOP ON IMAGE-BASED MODELING AND NAVIGATION FOR 
SPACE APPLICATIONS

June 4-5, 2018
Troy, NY

Although images of space objects have been used for decades, there are 
many common challenges in the use of image data for planetary science, 
optical navigation, and space situational awareness. Many of these 
challenges may be addressed by recent advancements in imaging sensors, 
computer vision algorithms, and computing resources - all of which set 
the stage for a fundamental change in how we will exploit image data 
for future space missions. This workshop aims to facilitate the 
dissemination of ideas between all of the communities using space 
image data and to identify areas of common need. The unique workshop 
format will include oral presentations, poster sessions, and focused 
breakout sessions to discuss topics of interest.

moons of Mars has been moved to February 28, 2018.

This special collection, sponsored by NASA's Solar System Exploration 
Research Virtual Institute (SSERVI) invites papers focusing on the 
science and exploration of the Moon, Near-Earth asteroids, and the 
moons of Mars. We invite contributions covering topics including, but 
not limited to, geologic investigations, dust/exosphere/plasma 
environments, surface remote sensing studies, field analog studies, 
laboratory analyses, and geophysical modeling relevant to the bodies 
of interest. In addition, we invite contributions focusing on efforts 
to prepare for future human exploration of these bodies. Special 
collection submissions can be submitted to JGR-Planets, JGR-Space

WORKSHOP: CARBON IN THE SOLAR SYSTEM 

April 25-27, 2018 
Denver, CO

https://carbon-workshop.arc.nasa.gov

With recent results from the Pluto system, the Saturn system, Mercury, 
and nearly all points in between, the time is right to hold a workshop 
to discuss and synthesize these results to improve our understanding of 
the role of carbon in the Solar System, how it evolves and how to 
recognize it. The workshop will include invited and contributed talks 
on observational, lab and modeling work related to carbon and 
carbonaceous species on Solar System bodies. The workshop will
emphasize discussion in addition to talks and posters, to encourage 
cross-communication within the community. This workshop is planned to be 
the first of two workshops, with the second held (on TBD dates in the 
future) to review and share work stemming from discussions at the first 
workshop (i.e. to address questions that come up at the first 
workshop). The workshop will be limited to 100 for in-person 
attendance. Webcast capabilities will be used to allow remote 
participation. Abstracts will be due March 6.
