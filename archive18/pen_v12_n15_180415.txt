EPSC SESSION: ASTROBIOLOGY

European Planetary Science Congress (EPSC) 2018 
Berlin, Germany
16-21 September 2018

Abstracts submission is now open to Session AB Astrobiology. 
Deadline: 16 May 2018, 13:00 CEST

Astrobiology is the study whether present or past life exist elsewhere
in the universe. To understand how life can begin in space, it is
essential to know what organic compounds were likely to have been
available, and how they interacted with the planetary environment.
Understanding how the planetary environment has influenced the
evolution of life and how biological processes have changed the
environment is an essential part of any study of the origin and search
for signs of life. The development of instrumentation and technology to
support the search for complex organic molecules and the survivability
of life in space environments is critical to define unambiguous
approaches to life detection over a broad range of planetary
environments.

This session welcomes abstracts for oral or poster presentations from
several scientific domains such as prebiotic and interstellar
chemistry, micropaleontology, limits of life, habitability, and
biosignature detection.

Looking forward to meet you in Berlin

EPSC SESSION: PLANETARY AERONOMY

European Planetary Science Congress (EPSC) 2018 
Berlin, Germany
16-21 September 2018

We invite your contributions to a special session on Planetary Aeronomy
at EPSC 2018 in Berlin, Germany (September 16-21, 2018):

https://meetingorganizer.copernicus.org/EPSC2018/session/29889

The aim of this session is to bring together researchers studying solar
system and exoplanet upper atmospheres to exchange knowledge and ideas
while learning of new results in this expanding area of research. We
welcome papers on all aspects of planetary upper atmospheres in the
solar and exoplanet systems, including observations and models that
bear on photochemistry and ionization, magnetosphere-ionosphere
coupling, energy balance, circulation and atmospheric escape. 
Contributions that allow us to better understand planetary evolution
and the mass-radius diagram of exoplanets are also encouraged. A list
of confirmed invited speakers will be announced later.

Please submit your abstracts by the EPSC abstract deadline of
Wednesday, May 16, 2018.

EPSC SESSION: MULTI-DISCIPLINARY APPROACHES TO INVESTIGATE THE INTERIOR
STRUCTURE AND EVOLUTION OF TERRESTRIAL BODIES AND ICY SATELLITES

European Planetary Science Congress (EPSC) 2018 
Berlin, Germany
16-21 September 2018

Please consider submitting an abstract to the Session MD3/TP13:
"Multi-disciplinary approaches to investigate the interior structure
and evolution of terrestrial bodies and icy satellites" 

Conveners: S. Padovan Co-conveners: A. Rozel, K. Soderlund, B. Schmidt,
N. Tosi, T. Ruedas, L. Noack

Constraints derived from geodetic (e.g., gravitational field,
obliquity, rotation rate, libration amplitudes), geochemical (e.g.,
surface composition, formation models), geological (e.g., surface age,
stratigraphy, and morphology), seismological, and magnetic observations
are routinely used to investigate various aspects of terrestrial
bodies, dwarf planets, and icy satellites. How can all this information
be combined to provide a global picture of the interior structure and
history of a planet? Given that different observables are available for
different planets, how is the investigation carried out for different
bodies?

This session welcomes contributions, from any field of the planetary
sciences, focused on approaches to investigate the global properties of
terrestrial planets and icy satellites using numerical modeling,
experiments, and available or expected data from current or forthcoming
planetary missions.

EPSC SESSION: MATTER UNDER PLANETARY INTERIOR CONDITIONS

European Planetary Science Congress (EPSC) 2018 
Berlin, Germany
16-21 September 2018

Dear Colleague,

We would like to invite you to attend session EXO4/TP14/OPS9/MD6:
"Matter Under Planetary Interior Conditions"

The session aims at understanding deep interiors and atmospheres of
solar system bodies and massive extra-solar planets, their associated
internal processes and corresponding material behavior at extreme
pressures and temperatures. These will have important implications for
structural models (e.g. location of layer boundaries), evolution
scenarios (e.g. de-mixing phenomena, diffusion), and magnetic field
generation (e.g. nonmetal-metal transitions). The session will include
solicited and contributed papers addressing observational, laboratory,
and theoretical studies of matter under planetary interior conditions.

Included subtopics are: 
1) Ab initio simulations and laboratory studies for matter under
   extreme conditions
2) Interior structure, composition, and evolution
3) Equation of state, melting, and phase transformation at extreme
   states

For more information please visit the web-site:

https://meetingorganizer.copernicus.org/EPSC2018/session/29876

Abstract submission deadline: 16 May 2018, 13:00 CEST

Please feel free to forward this message to interested colleagues or
groups.

We look forward to your abstract submission and hope to see you in
Berlin

Best regards

F. Sohl, M. French, Z. Konopkova, S. Padovan (conveners)

LSST SOLAR SYSTEM SCIENCE COLLABORATION

Over its 10 year lifespan, the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST)
will catalog over 5 million Main Belt asteroids, almost 300,000 Jupiter
Trojans, over 100,000 NEOs, over 40,000 KBOs, over 10,000 comets, and
tens of interstellar objects. Many of these objects will receive
hundreds of observations in multiple bandpasses. The LSST Solar System
Science Collaboration (SSSC) is preparing methods and tools to analyze
this data, as well as understand optimum survey strategies for
discovering moving objects throughout the Solar System.

Learn more at: 

http://www.lsstsssc.org

Please consider joining the collaboration if you're an eligible
researcher. If you have any questions, please contact the SSSC
Co-Chairs, Meg Schwamb (mschwamb.astro@gmail.com) and David Trilling

GEOSCIENCES SPECIAL ISSUE RECENT ADVANCES IN LUNAR STUDIES

Dear Colleagues,

The journal Geosciences is accepting papers for a Special Issue related
to recent advances in studies of the Moon. Since the Apollo era, sample
studies, remote analyses, and dynamical models continue to tease out
details related to the Moon's formation and evolution. Additionally,
the international lunar science community is eager to continue its
presence on the Moon, as evidenced by recent, upcoming, and future
lunar missions. All of these topics are of great interest to the
broader geoscience community.

The Special Issue welcomes papers that describe studies related to any
of the above topics and will be an outlet for rapid, accessible, and
peer-reviewed publications. The editors especially welcome papers from
young investigators. The deadline for manuscript submissions is 15 June
2018.
