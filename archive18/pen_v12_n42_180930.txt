IN MEMORIAM: WILLIAM R. WARD (1944 - 2018)

William (Bill) R. Ward passed away on September 20th at his home in
Prescott, AZ after a battle with brain cancer. Ward was a preeminent
theoretician that made many seminal contributions to our understanding
of planetary dynamics and solar system formation. With his thesis
advisor, Peter Goldreich, Ward proposed that planetesimals were formed
via local gravitational instability in the protostellar disk. In 1973,
Ward was the first to recognize that the obliquity of Mars undergoes
large oscillations, and with Alastair Cameron in 1976, he was one of
the original proposers of the giant impact theory for the origin of
the Moon. Ward was a pioneer in the study of gravitational
interactions between planets and their precursor gas disk, and how
these may cause large scale changes in planetary orbits. His many
papers on this topic elucidated the nature of Type I vs. Type II
migration, central to our understanding of planet formation in our
Solar System and in exoplanetary systems. Ward also contributed
greatly to our understanding of satellite formation and dynamical
evolution. After completing his Ph.D. at Caltech, Ward worked as a
post-doc at CFA, before moving to JPL. He joined SwRI in Boulder, Co.,
in 1998, and retired from SwRI as an Institute Scientist in 2014. Ward
is survived by his wife Sandra, brother Jeff, sister Patty, sons Brad
and Scott, and daughter Stephanie.

BATEMAN POSTDOCTORAL FELLOWSHIP, YALE UNIVERSITY
 
The Department of Geology and Geophysics at Yale University announces
an annual competition for a Bateman Postdoctoral Fellowship. We
welcome applicants with research interests across the full range of
disciplines within earth and planetary sciences (geophysics, planetary
sciences, tectonics, oceans, atmosphere, climate dynamics,
geochemistry, paleoclimatology, geobiology, and the evolution of
life). The Postdoctoral Associate position is awarded for two years,
providing a stipend ($60,000/yr) and base research funds ($5,000/yr),
plus health care benefits and limited relocation expenses. Applicants
should contact a sponsor in the Department to discuss potential
research projects, and then submit a short (2-3 page) statement of
research interests and proposed research, a curriculum vitae with a
full list of publications, an endorsement letter from the sponsoring
faculty member, and three confidential letters of reference.
Applications should be submitted online at:

http://apply.interfolio.com/54659

The deadline for receipt of all application materials is December 15,
2018, and successful candidates are expected to begin their program at
Yale between July 1 and December 31, 2019. Yale University is an
Affirmative Action/Equal Opportunity employer. Yale values diversity
among its students, staff, and faculty and strongly welcomes
applications from women, persons with disabilities, protected
veterans, and underrepresented minorities.

POSTDOCTORAL POSITION COMETARY ATMOSPHERES

The Physics Department at Auburn University invites applicants for a
post-doctoral research position within the Atomic, Molecular and
Optical Physics group in the field of cometary atmospheres.

http://www.auburn.edu/cosam/departments/physics/research/atomic.htm

The successful candidate will analyze images of comet 9P/Tempel 1
taken during the flyby of NASA's Deep Impact spacecraft. These images
were acquired with comet specific narrowband filters and allow for a
detailed study of the gas and dust surrounding the nucleus. The goal
of this project is to connect this gas and dust to specific areas on
the nucleus, to investigate chemically heterogenous outgassing, and to
identify atomic and molecular processes that alter the inner coma.

Familiarity with planetary science and/or atomic and molecular physics
is preferred. Substantial familiarity with a commonly-used scientific
programming language (e.g. IDL, Python) is highly desirable. Review of
applications will begin October 19th, 2018 and continue throughout the
year as the positions become available.

The contact for this activity is Prof. Dennis Bodewits
(dennis@auburn.edu).

RESEARCH ASSOCIATE IN PLANETARY SCIENCE AT CU BOULDER

The newly formed Exploration of Planetary Ices and Climates (EPIC)
group at the University of Colorado's Laboratory for Atmospheric and
Space Physics (LASP) is seeking to fill a research position in
planetary geophysics and remote sensing. Candidates at the levels of
RS-I and RS-II will be considered. The initial appointment is for one
year, with opportunities for future extensions.

Research duties include conducting studies of the atmospheres and
surfaces of planets and their natural satellites, including Earth's
moon, using data from NASA's Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter, Mars
Reconnaissance Orbiter, and/or legacy datasets such as Cassini and
Galileo. Candidates with expertise in numerical modeling and
simulation of physical phenomena including ice/vapor transport,
dynamical processes, or impact cratering are especially encouraged to
apply. Studies of exoplanets and exomoons may also be supported.

The CU/LASP EPIC group conducts a diverse research program
encompassing data analysis, simulation, and theoretical studies to
understand the atmospheres and surfaces of icy planets and moons. The
group maintains strong involvement in both active and future NASA
planetary missions. Inquiries may be directed to Prof. Paul Hayne:
Paul.Hayne@Colorado.edu

AN ASTROBIOLOGY SCIENCE STRATEGY FOR THE SEARCH FOR LIFE IN THE
UNIVERSE: PUBLIC BRIEFING AND WEBCAST ON 10/10/18

Are we alone in the universe? Astrobiology, the study of the origins
of life in the universe and the search for life on other worlds, is a
highly interdisciplinary and rapidly changing field at the
intersection of biology, chemistry, geology, planetary science, and
physics. Recent scientific advances have opened new doors for
astrobiological inquiry and at the request of NASA and Congress, the
National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine appointed a
committee to develop a future research strategy for the field of
astrobiology. Please join us for this public briefing event and
webcast, where committee chair Barbara Sherwood Lollar and committee
member Alan Boss will discuss the report's recommendations and take
questions from the audience.

Date and Time: Wednesday, October 10, 2018 from 11am-12pm EDT

Location: National Academy of Sciences Building, Members Room 2101
Constitution Ave., N.W., Washington, DC, 20418
