EPSC SESSION: VOLCANISM AND TECTONISM ACROSS THE SOLAR SYSTEM

European Planetary Science Congress (EPSC) 2018
Berlin, Germany
16-21 September 2018

Abstracts submission is now open to Session TP8/OPS11/MD5/SB23 
Volcanism and tectonism across the Solar system.
Deadline: 16 May 2018, 13:00 CEST

Please visit:

https://www.epsc2018.eu/home.html

Volcanism and tectonism are two of the most ubiquitous processes at 
work in the Solar System, shaping substantially the surfaces of worlds 
as diverse as the terrestrial planets, main-belt asteroids, and icy 
satellites. Through a combination of solicited and contributed 
presentations, this session will host observational, laboratory, 
theoretical, or analogue fieldwork research into any aspect of 
planetary volcanic and tectonic activity. We particularly welcome 
submissions that compare landforms and processes on multiple bodies, 
and how lessons from specific studies can be applied to understanding 
volcanism and tectonism across the Solar System.

Looking forward to meet you in Berlin!

JPL EXPERIMENTAL POSTDOCTORAL POSITION

Physics and Chemistry of Outer Planetary (Europa) Ice Analogs

Further details and link to apply are at: 

https://postdocs-jpl.icims.com/jobs/

The Jet Propulsion Laboratory invites applications for a postdoctoral 
research position in the Planetary Ices Group. The research work will 
focus on the area of physics and chemistry of outer planetary ice 
analogs using laboratory simulations and spectroscopy. Candidates 
should have a recent Ph.D. in chemistry, physics, astronomy or 
planetary sciences and a strong motivation to undertake this 
multidisciplinary research. Experience and expertise in the following 
techniques are highly desired: low-temperature techniques, laboratory 
ultraviolet and infrared spectroscopy, laser spectroscopy, ultra-high 
vacuum techniques, and mass-spectrometry. Candidates who have received 
their PhD within the past five years since the date of their 
application are eligible. Postdoctoral positions are awarded for a 
minimum of one-year period and may be renewed up to a maximum duration 
of three years.

The Jet Propulsion Laboratory is a federal facility. Due to rules 
imposed by NASA, JPL will not accept applications from citizens of 
designated countries unless they are Legal Permanent Residents of the 
U.S or have other protected status under 8 U.S.C. 1324b(a)(3). The 
Designated Countries List is available at:

NOMINATIONS FOR OPAG STEERING COMMITTEE AND OPAG CHAIR

NASA solicits nominations (including self nominations) for new members 
of the 15-person steering committee for the Outer Planets Assessment 
Group. See: 

https://www.lpi.usra.edu/opag/ 

Nominations are due by May 7, 2018 and should be sent to current chair 
Alfred McEwen: mcewen@lpl.arizona.edu. At least 3 positions need to be 
filled ASAP. Candidates for OPAG chair should indicate their interest 
in that role.  NASA will ultimately choose new members by striving to 
maintain balance in essential expertise (science and technology) and 
diversity (gender, ethnicity, career stage, institution, etc.).

COMMENTS ON 2018 OPAG GOALS DOCUMENT ARE DUE JULY 2, 2018

An extensively revised draft goals document for the Outer Planets 
Assessment Group has been posted at: 

https://www.lpi.usra.edu/opag/ 

We invite the OPAG science community to provide feedback by using the 
OPAG Discussion Board: 

https://www.lpi.usra.edu/forums/viewforum.php?f=2 

To use this, you must have filled out a notification of interest form
and register for the discussion board at:  

https://www.lpi.usra.edu/opag/opag.cfm 

We plan to provide a 2018 version of this document to the Discovery 
program library, so we need comments by July 2. The goals document 
will continue to be updated for input to the next Decadal Survey.

August 13 – 17, 2018
VENUE: Sagamihara Campus of JAXA, Institute of Space and Astronautical 
Science, Japan
 
The subject of discussion includes all kinds of cosmic dust such as 
interstellar, protoplanetary and debris disk dust, presolar grains, 
cometary and interplanetary dust, micrometeorites, meteoroids, 
meteors, regolith particles and planetary aerosols. The meeting is 
open for any aspects of dust research by means of different methods 
of studies (in-situ and laboratory measurements, astronomical 
observations, laboratory and numerical simulations, theoretical 
modeling, data analysis, etc.). Also welcome are papers on 
dust-related topics, for example: the formation of molecules and their 
reactions on and their desorption from the surface of a solid 
substance; light scattering by non-spherical particles and particulate 
surfaces; space missions and instrumentation for measurements of 
particulates.

CALL FOR FARINELLA PRIZE 2018

To honor the memory and the outstanding figure of Paolo Farinella
(1953-2000), an extraordinary scientist and person, a prize has been 
established in recognition of significant contributions given in the 
fields of interest of Paolo, which span from planetary sciences to 
space geodesy, fundamental physics, science popularization, security 
in space, weapons control and disarmament. The prize is supported by 
the following international Institutions: University of Pisa, ASI, 
INAF, IFAC-CNR, Observatoire de Nice (France).

The eighth Paolo Farinella Prize is devoted to planetary sciences and
specifically to studies on the "Giant planets satellite systems". The 
award ceremony will be hosted by the European Planetary Science 
Congress (EPSC) meeting in Berlin, Germany (16th to 21st of September 
2018).

Further information, along with the rules of the prize and the 
nomination form, can be found at:
