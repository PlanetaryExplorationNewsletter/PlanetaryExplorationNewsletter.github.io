PDS/IPDA BOOTH AT AGU - PLANETARY DATA DISCOVERY CHALLENGE/TUTORIALS 

The Planetary Data System (PDS), and International Planetary Data 
Alliance (IPDA) will have a booth (#1447) at the 2018 AGU meeting to 
provide support to the scientific community. Booth visitors will be 
invited to take the "Planetary Data Discovery Challenge", to find a 
NASA planetary data set of interest in the PDS archive. In addition, 
there will be scheduled and walk-in training sessions for both 
individuals and small groups (up to 4 persons). 

Specific training time slots may be reserved at: 

http://pds-training.psi.edu 

Available topics: 

- Finding PDS Data 
- General training on PDS4 (either for missions or R&A archives) 
- Data Management Plans for Proposers 
- Designing Mission or Project PDS4 Dictionaries 
- Archiving your data: Bring your data and we will get you started.
- Using PDS4 data: How is it different and tools to read the PDS4 
  labels
- PDS4 Tool Training

NASA POSTDOCTORAL FELLOWSHIP - APPLICATION DEADLINE MARCH 1, 2019

The NASA Postdoctoral Program offers US and international scientists 
the opportunity to advance their research while contributing to NASA's 
scientific goals. The NPP supports fundamental science; explores the 
undiscovered; promotes intellectual growth; and encourages scientific 
connections.

Selected by a competitive peer-review process, NPP Fellows complete 
one- to three-year Fellowship appointments that advance NASA's missions 
in earth science, heliophysics, planetary science, astrophysics, space 
bioscience, aeronautics and engineering, human exploration and space 
operations, and astrobiology.

Current NPP research opportunities in planetary science can be viewed 
here:

https://npp.usra.edu/opportunities/?filter_keywords=&filter_fields=145

Applicants must have a Ph.D. or equivalent degree in hand before 
beginning the fellowship, but may apply while completing the degree 
requirements. U.S. citizens, Lawful Permanent Residents, and foreign 
nationals eligible for J-1 status as a Research Scholar may apply.

Stipends start at $60,000 per year, with supplements for high 
cost-of-living areas and for certain academic specialties. Financial 
assistance is available for relocation and health insurance, and 
$10,000 per year is provided for professional travel.

Applications are accepted three times each year: March 1, July 1, and 
November 1.

EXOCLIMES V

Pre-registration is open until 31 Jan, 2019.

ExoClimes V will convene in Oxford, UK, 12-15 August 2019.

The series brings together exoplanet observers, modelers, and theorists
with researchers on fundamental atmospheric and planetary interior
processes in the Solar-System and Earth-Science communities, so that 
the communities can learn from one another.

The meeting is limited to 140 attendees, who must be in residence for
the full meeting. Participants will be selected on the basis of
information provided during pre-registration. To pre-register, follow
the pre-registration link at:

http://exoclimes2019.org

Conference fees are not charged as part of pre-registration, but
anticipated fees (which include food and lodging) are listed on the
pre-registration page.  Some financial aid will be available.

An exciting list of keynote speakers and an outline program are also on
the web site. We are looking forward to another stimulating and
enjoyable ExoClimes!

JGR PLANETS: SCIENCE ENABLED BY THE LUNAR RECONNAISSANCE ORBITER
CORNERSTONE MISSION

A special collection of the Journal of Geophysical Research: Planets 
titled "Science Enabled by the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter Cornerstone 
Mission" is now open for submissions. The deadline is 15 March 2019.

Please help us celebrate the upcoming LRO 10th anniversary by 
submitting to this special collection!

This issue will include new studies enabled or enhanced by data from 
the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) third extended science mission, 
the Cornerstone Mission. The Moon is a witness plate to the history of 
the Earth-Moon system and the cornerstone for understanding processes 
affecting airless bodies in the Solar System. During the Cornerstone 
Mission, LRO scientists have focused on measuring and examining 
fundamental processes present on the Moon that operate throughout the 
Solar System, including processes that are active today and those that 
began billions of years ago. Papers for the special issue are 
encouraged from the LRO science team and members of the community who 
use LRO data to study lunar and other airless body processes.

Submit manuscripts through the GEMS website. For additional information 
please contact any of the organizers.

Thank you,

Benjamin Greenhagen, Rachel Klima, Cesare Grava, and Brett Denevi

  ChemCam
  CheMin
  DAN
  Hazcam
  MAHLI
  MARDI
  Mastcam
  Navcam
  PLACES
  RAD
  REMS
  SAM
  SPICE

VENUS EXPLORATION DECADAL SURVEY WHITE PAPERS

The Venus Exploration Analysis Group (VEXAG) will be conducting a 
multi-step campaign through March 2019 to develop a coherent set of 
Venus Exploration Decadal Survey White Papers.

1) Link to Pre-Decadal White Paper VEXAG encourages all Venus community 
members to consider short, to-the-point papers. A spreadsheet for these 
contributions is:

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d
/1TZGokHreJ3_oP77mTeaj8oVTUY9sO6tvmKqCc537nEc/edit?usp=sharing

This link and links to the white papers themselves will be on the 
VEXAG website.

2) Key Document Revisions: The VEXAG Goals, Objectives, and 
Investigations (GOI), Venus Roadmap, and Venus Technology Plan 
documents are being revised in preparation for the next Decadal 
Survey.

2a) Access to the Key VEXAG Documents (12/21/18): The current working 
drafts of each document will be posted on the VEXAG for community 
review and comments.

2b) Venus Community Telecon (Monday, 2/4/19): A public open telecon 
to discuss these documents will be held from 4-6pm EDT. This telecon 
will cover current versions of the documents.

2c) Predecadal Review Session at LPSC (Sunday, 3/17/19): VEXAG will 
host a special review session immediately before LPSC from 1-4 pm CDT 
to solicit additional feedback on these key documents. Additional 
information (e.g., call in numbers, schedules) will be posted to the 
VEXAG website and PEN.
