CURTIN UNIVERSITY POSTDOCTORAL RESEARCHER
 
A 3-year post-doctoral research position to study the chronology of
Mars using automated crater counting methods working with Assoc. Prof.
Gretchen Benedix is available in the Planetary Science Group at Curtin
University (Perth, Australia).

Integrating image processing, high performance computing, geochemical
and geochronological studies, this project aims to determine a detailed
and accurate geologic timescale for Mars. The project aims to apply
novel automated feature recognition techniques to high resolution
space-craft derived images of the surface of Mars. Combining this with
formation ages of Martian meteorites, the anticipated goal of the
project is to define an absolute chronology for Mars. A more complete
timescale will provide context for the geologic processes that affected
Mars and may help to better understand the past habitability of the
planet. The aim of this research is to combine two geochronology
datasets - crater counting and new radiometric ages - in an innovative,
multi-disciplinary way.

Applicant must have a PhD in planetary geology, geophysics, or related
field. Experience studying and interpreting Mars surface geology via
image processing or machine learning highly desired. Experience with
mineralogy/petrology of Martian rocks is also a plus.

COSPAR 2018: NEAR-TERM EXPLORATION OF THE INTERSTELLAR MEDIUM
 
14-22 July 2018
Pasadena, California
 
Exploration of the heliosphere and the far-reaches of our solar system
by the Voyagers and New Horizons, and near-Earth observations of the
Kuiper Belt and exoplanetary systems have all profoundly changed how we
view our own home in space. An Interstellar Probe escaping beyond the
solar-system boundaries with new observational techniques would be a
bold move in space exploration enabling detailed, new understanding of
the global heliosphere in the context other astrospheres, further
discoveries of unexplored KBOs, and the first observations of our
circumsolar dust, disk offering insight into the evolution of the solar
system and understanding circumstellar disks of exoplanetary systems.

This event welcomes papers on (1) science of the nearby interstellar
medium and outer solar system, (2) instrumentation for relevant in-situ
and remote measurements, and (3) mission and spacecraft concepts for
reaching observation points far past the capability of the Voyagers and
New Horizons.

Abstract Deadline: 9 February 2018.

LPI CELEBRATION CLARIFICATION

LPI 50th Anniversary Celebration - An announcement for an upcoming,
invitation-only science symposium and reception was erroneously
published last week. While we would like to open these events to
everyone, we are unfortunately constrained by available space and must
limit attendance with individual invitations. Soon, we will be
announcing a special web page for LPI 50th anniversary events, and we
will post to that page some of the presentations from the symposium. In
addition, during the year-long celebration of the LPI's 50th
anniversary, we have planned several opportunities for the entire
planetary community to celebrate with us. Through these many paths, we
look forward to connecting with everyone.
 
Thank you,

FIRST ANNOUNCEMENT OF DIDYMOS OBSERVER WORKSHOP 2018
 
2018 June 19-21
Prague, Czech Republic 
 
The binary near-Earth asteroid (65803) Didymos is the planned target
for the Asteroid Impact & Deflection Assessment (AIDA,
https://www-n.oca.eu/michel/AIDA/) mission. AIDA will be the first
space experiment to demonstrate asteroid impact hazard mitigation by
using a kinetic impactor to deflect an asteroid. It is an
international cooperation, consisting of two mission elements: the NASA
Double Asteroid Redirection Test (DART, http://dart.jhuapl.edu/)
mission and the ESA Hera (previously known as AIM) rendezvous mission.

Remote (mostly Earth-based) observations of Didymos are an important
part of the mission. In this workshop, we will discuss observations for
the 2019, 2020-2021, and 2022 apparitions of Didymos. We will discuss
detailed plans and expected outcomes for 2019 observations and
preliminary observing plans for the subsequent apparitions.

Additional meeting information is available at:

understanding the physical and chemical conditions associated with the
formation of crusts, cores, atmospheres, and oceans on both rocky and
volatile-rich bodies. We seek input from many types of studies,
including petrologic, isotopic, trace element, and paleo-magnetic
analyses of samples, geophysical probes of planetary interiors, and
experimental and numerical simulations. There will be an optional,
pre-conference field trip to an anorthosite complex in the San Gabriel
Mountains on May 7. The conference will consist of 3.5 days of
presentations and discussion, May 8-11, ending by noon on May 11. One
page abstracts are by March 1. Some travel support will be available
for early career individuals (current students or less than three years
since completion of the Ph.D.). Additional details are available at the
conference website:

SEEKING NESSF REVIEWERS

We are looking for reviewers for Planetary NESSF (NASA Earth and Space
Science Fellowship) proposals. If you (or someone you know) would like
to get review panel experience, or you want to try your hand at being a
group chief, NESSF is a great place to start. Even if you are a more
senior scientist and a panel pro but just want to help out of the
kindness of your heart and a sense of duty to the community, we'd love
to have you too! Help us show the newbies how it is done. NESSF covers
nearly every topic in planetary science, so whatever your expertise is,
we probably need it. These panels are done entirely virtually, no
travel is required, and we pay you the usual honorarium. Volunteer form
