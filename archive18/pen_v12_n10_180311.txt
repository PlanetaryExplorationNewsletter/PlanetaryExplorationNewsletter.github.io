POSTDOC IN PLANETARY GEOPHYSICS AT BROWN UNIVERSITY

The Department of Earth, Environmental and Planetary Sciences at Brown 
University will have an opening for a Postdoctoral Research Associate 
in the areas of planetary geophysics and statistical data analyses 
starting in Fall 2018

The successful candidate will carry out research on a project selected 
to match the candidate. Possible research topics include, but are not 
limited to Martian volcanology, Martian hydrology, analysis of lunar 
gravity data, planetary thermochemical evolution, magnetohydrodynamics, 
and lunar chronology. Research would include quantitative or 
qualitative analyses of planetary mission data and/or numerical 
modeling. The successful candidate will be expected to carry out 
independent research, give presentations at professional meetings, and 
prepare publications on the work.

Interested individuals should have a Ph.D. in Planetary Science, 
Geology, Physics/Astronomy, Mathematics, Statistics, or a related 
field. If interested, please send a brief statement of research 
interests and future research goals along with your CV to Alex Evans at 
alex_evans [at] brown [dot] edu.

PLANETARY TAXONOMY: THE GEOPHYSICAL PLANET DEFINITION

Sunday, March 18, 2:30 to 4:00 PM, Panther Creek Room, at LPSC

Come to a frank, open, but friendly panelist discussion on the 
scientific usefulness - or lack thereof - of the Geophysical Planet 
Definition (GPD) in recognizing the many subcategories of 
"full-fledged" planets such as giant, terrestrial, dwarf, satellite 
planet, etc. The panelists will also discuss the need for a deeper 
understanding of scientists' taxonomic freedoms and responsibilities, 
clearer science communication and pedagogy, enhanced scientific 
literacy, and how the GPD is a vehicle for these goals.

WALK ON MARS WITH THEMIS AT LPSC

The 2001 Mars Odyssey spacecraft and the Thermal Emission Imaging 
System (THEMIS) have been acquiring infrared images of Mars for more 
than 16 years. The best-quality images from the mission have been 
compiled into a global mosaic at 100 m/pixel resolution and printed 
on a walkable basketball court-sized vinyl mat for education and 
public outreach events. Come join the Odyssey and THEMIS teams in 
celebrating 16 years at Mars by walking across the Red Planet for 
yourself!

Wednesday, March 21st, 6:00 to 8:30 PM, Waterway 4-5

JWST CYCLE 1 ARCHIVAL RESEARCH PROPOSALS WILL CONSIDER SOME GTO TARGETS

The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) Cycle 1 call for proposals now 
includes opportunities for Archival Research (AR) proposals of targets 
in the Guaranteed Time Observation (GTO) programs that have no 
exclusive access period - a full list can be found here: 

https://tinyurl.com/y7kqsj7c  

Most available programs include Solar System objects and details of 
these observations can also found through the link provided. The JWST 
AR Program can provide financial support for U.S. scientists for the 
analysis of such data sets. AR proposals must outline a management 
plan and detailed budget for analyzing the data. Proposals for Archival 
Research are considered at the same time, and by the same reviewers, as 
proposals for observing time, on the basis of scientific merit.

The JWST Cycle 1 Proposals are DUE April 6, 2018 at 8pm Eastern Time.

ROSES-18: FINAL TEXT FOR D.14 SOFIA 4TH GEN INSTRUMENTATION

Proposals are requested for scientific investigations that would 
develop and use scientific instrumentation capable of achieving the 
goals of NASA's Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy 
(SOFIA). The intent is to select and execute development of one or 
more new SOFIA science instruments and/or upgrades to existing 
instruments.

This program element requests a notice of intent by June 1, 2018, but 
also uses a binding two-Step process in which successful 25-page 
Step-1 proposals will be funded for a five-month (<$500K) Instrument 
Concept Study Phase (see Section 6) culminating a Concept Study Phase 
reports in 2019 that will serve as Step-2 proposals from which 
instruments may be selected and funded for development.

Optional NOIs are requested by June 1, 2018, Step-1 proposals are due 
August 1, 2018 and NASA will communicate directly with those selected 
regarding the submission concepts study reports as Step-2 proposals 
March 2019. Three pre-proposal workshops will be held, see Section 
12.1 of the program element for more information.
