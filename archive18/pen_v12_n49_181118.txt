2019 PIERAZZO INTERNATIONAL STUDENT TRAVEL AWARD

Application deadline: 9 PM MST, November 29, 2018

Awards will be announced on or before December 10, 2018

This award is established by the Planetary Science Institute in memory
of Senior Scientist Betty Pierazzo to support and encourage graduate
students to build international collaborations and relationships in
planetary science. Two awards will be made each year, contingent upon
there being meritorious applications. One will be awarded to a
graduate student working on his or her Ph.D. at an institution within
the U.S. This is to support travel to a planetary science related
meeting (conferences and workshops) outside of the U.S. The second
award will be to a graduate student working on his or her Ph.D. at an
institution outside of the U.S. This is to support travel to a
planetary science related meeting within the U.S. These include
general meetings that have planetary-focused sessions such as the AGU,
GSA, EGU and IAG.

The award will consist of a certificate and up to $2000US.

PH.D. OPPORTUNITIES IN EARTH AND PLANETARY SCIENCES AT THE UNIVERSITY 
OF ROCHESTER

Application Deadline: Jan 15, 2019

Earth and Planetary Science Laboratory group at the University of 
Rochester seeks highly motivated applicants for Ph.D. degrees. The 
group performs cutting-edge numerical simulations to model planetary 
impact processes, formation and evolution of terrestrial planets and 
moons in the solar and extra solar systems as well as geodynamic 
processes of planetary interiors. The goal of the research is to 
deepen our understanding of the planetary systems by combining 
numerical models with geological, geophysical, geochemical, and 
astronomical observations. We have dedicated access to high 
performance computing facilities and a strong connection with the 
Laboratory for Laser Energetics (LLE) on campus.

Students with strong backgrounds in physics and computer science are 
encouraged to apply. Applications will be accepted through the 
Department of Earth and Environmental Sciences: 

http://www.sas.rochester.edu/ees/graduate/apply.html 

and the Department of Physics and Astronomy: 

https://www.pas.rochester.edu/graduate/applying.html

For more information, please contact Professor Miki Nakajima 
(mnakajima@rochester.edu).

MARS TARGET ENCYCLOPEDIA INTEGRATED INTO MSL ANALYST'S NOTEBOOK

The Analyst's Notebook for Curiosity rover now contains literature
references to targets captured as part of the Mars Target Encyclopedia 
(MTE) project developed by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory Machine 
Learning and Instrument Autonomy Group and funded by the Multimission 
Ground System and Services (MGSS) program and the Mars Science 
Laboratory project.

The literature references were extracted automatically from 5,920 
abstracts published at the Lunar and Planetary Science Conference in 
2014-2016. They were analyzed using a machine learning model to 
recognize elements, minerals, and ChemCam targets. Detected elements, 
minerals, and targets were further analyzed to determine whether a 
statement about the geochemical composition of the target was present. 
Manual review of the extracted relations ensures high quality. All 
relations are stored in the Mars Target Encyclopedia (MTE), which 
Analyst Notebook users can search to find what has been published 
about targets, elements, or minerals of interest.

CENTAUR EXPLORATION WORKSHOP: THE ROOTS OF ACTIVITY 

Please note updated information.

March 6-8, 2019
Florida Space Institute, University of Central Florida, Orlando, FL. 

https://cew2019.arc.nasa.gov

NOI, Registration and Abstract Submission: Now Open
NOI Deadline: November 30, 2018
Registration and Abstract Submission Deadline: January 7, 2019

This is a workshop addressing the scientific importance and space 
exploration relevance of active centaurs, with a specific focus on 
mapping knowledge gaps and paths forward.

In-situ participation will be capped: Consider registering early and 
submitting an abstract. 

Online participation will be available: Will require registration and 
notice of acceptance.

The workshop's impetus is two-fold: Advance our understanding of how 
small bodies originate, evolve and become active beyond Jupiter's 
orbit; Planning of Earth-based and space-based exploration strategies
aimed at representative objects of the Centaur population. We will 
include forward-looking presentations and free discussions to allow 
for streaming of ideas and encourage inclusive participation. 

We strongly encourage the participation of early career researchers 
(including graduate students and postdoctoral researchers). We aim 
for the workshop to result in a white paper and a plan for a 
multi-wavelength observing campaign.

CASSINI SCIENCE SYMPOSIUM

The Cassini Project will host a five-day Cassini Science Symposium 
May 20-24, 2019. The meeting will be held at the Applied Physics 
Laboratory in Laurel, Maryland.

Abstracts will be due 15 February 2019. Additional information, 
including the meeting website, will be included in a future notice.  
For now, please save these dates.  

A combination of invited review talks, contributed oral and poster 
papers are solicited covering the latest Cassini findings on the 
Saturn system, including the interpretation and synthesis of results.  
Sessions will include interdisciplinary talks and will cover the 
following disciplines: Rings, Titan, Icy Satellites, Magnetospheres 
and Saturn. Talks emphasizing Saturn-Jupiter synergies are encouraged. 
Discipline-focused workshops will also be held during the late 
afternoons. This Symposium can serve as a springboard for future 
studies and space missions. Future mission posters will be accepted.

We hope to see you there.

POSTDOCTORAL RESEARCHER IN PLANETARY SCIENCE

The Department of Physics at the University of Helsinki (Finland) is
seeking an ambitious postdoctoral researcher to join the Planetary
System Research Group.

The successful candidate is expected to carry out research within the
framework of a project entitled "Population-level constraints on
asteroid interior structure and composition". The aims of the project
are to i) understand the mechanism leading to the destruction of
near-Earth objects (NEOs) close to the Sun, ii) develop a
state-of-the-art model of the near-Earth-object (NEO) population that
accounts for the thermal and tidal disruption of NEOs, and iii) enable
and prepare for solar system science with the European Space Agency's
Euclid mission, currently planned to be launched in 2021.

Applicants should have a Ph.D. in planetary science or a closely 
related field, and, preferably, experience with numerical modeling of 
asteroid orbital evolution and/or disruption of asteroids or asteroid
constituents. In addition, good programming and data analysis skills
and a demonstrated ability to work both independently and in a team
are considered highly advantageous.

Deadline for applications is November 30, 2018.

well as details on how to apply are available at:
