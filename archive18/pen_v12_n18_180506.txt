EPSC SESSION: THE GAIA MISSION - FIRST DATA EXPLOITATION FOR ASTEROID
SCIENCE

European Planetary Science Congress (EPSC) 2018
Berlin, Germany
16-21 September 2018

Deadline: 16 May 2018, 13:00 CEST

https://www.epsc2018.eu/home.html

In April 2018, the first astrometric and photometric data of Gaia for
asteroids have been published in the second Data Release (DR2), and the
exploitation by the community has started. A few months later, we have
the opportunity to review the scientific impact of the impressive
performance reaching sub-mas accuracy on single epoch positions. We can
also evaluate the changes induced on the software tools and on specific
science issues. For instance, coupling Gaia to ground-based data, due
to a different bias and properties, is a problem in itself. Some
ground-based activities such as the observations of stellar
occultations, local astrometry by imaging (on new and ancient data),
also take a large profit from the dramatic increase of star and
asteroid positions. In this respect, the astrometry of stars published
earlier in DR1 has already produced different applications to Solar
System observations, that are now improved or surpassed by DR2 with 1.3
billion parallaxes and proper motions. Contributions on the use of Gaia
data (directly on asteroids or as stellar catalogue) for the science of
Solar System objects are welcome.

Looking forward to meet you in Berlin!

EPSC SESSION: ATMOSPHERES OF TERRESTRIAL PLANETS

European Planetary Science Congress (EPSC) 2018
Berlin, Germany
16-21 September 2018

Deadline: 16 May 2018, 13:00 CEST

https://meetingorganizer.copernicus.org/EPSC2018/session/29454

Dear Colleagues,

We invite you to submit abstracts to our session TP5: "Atmospheres of
terrestrial planets". See you in Berlin!

TP5: Atmospheres of terrestrial planets 
Convener: Anni Maattanen
Co-conveners: Olivier Witasse, Francisco Gonzalez-Galindo, Dmitrij
Titov

Space missions have provided a wealth of data on the atmospheres and
aeronomy of terrestrial planets, from the lower layers up to the
external envelopes in direct contact with the solar wind. An emerging
finding stemming from the last few years' of work by the scientific
community is the evidence that the atmospheres behaves as a single
coherent system with complex couplings between layers.

This session solicits contributions that provide insight into the
processes at work (chemistry, energetics, dynamics, electricity, escape
etc.) on terrestrial planets Venus, Mars, Titan and into the coupling
between the lower/middle and upper atmospheres. Contributions based on
analysis of recent spacecraft and ground-based observations,
comparative planetology studies, numerical modelling and relevant
laboratory investigations are particularly welcome. The session will
consist of oral talks, both invited and contributed, and posters.

EPSC SESSION: MARS INTERIOR AND SURFACE

European Planetary Science Congress (EPSC) 2018
Berlin, Germany
16-21 September 2018

Deadline: 16 May 2018, 13:00 CEST

https://meetingorganizer.copernicus.org/EPSC2018/session/29451

This session welcomes all presentations on Mars' interior and surface
processes. The aim of this session is to bring together disciplines as
various as geology, geomorphology, geophysics, mineralogy, glaciology,
and chemistry. We welcome presentations on either present or past Mars
processes, either pure Mars science or comparative planetology with the
Earth, either observations or modeling or laboratory experiments (or
any combination of those). New results on Mars science obtained from
recent in situ and orbital measurements are particularly encouraged, as
well as prospective science for the preparation of future missions to
be exploring Mars (InSight, ExoMars, Rover 2020).

EPSC SESSION: OBSERVATIONS AND MODELLING OF EXOPLANET ATMOSPHERES,
INTERIORS AND ORBITS

European Planetary Science Congress (EPSC) 2018
Berlin, Germany
16-21 September 2018

Deadline: 16 May 2018, 13:00 CEST

https://www.epsc2018.eu/home.html

What are the extrasolar planets actually like and why are they as they
are? To answer these questions, a broad range of skills and expertise
is required, ranging in topics from Solar System science to statistical
astrophysics, from ground-based observations to spacecraft
measurements, and atmospheric/interior/orbital modelling. Abstracts are
encouraged in all these areas of exoplanet science.

Looking forward to meet you in Berlin!

Co-conveners: Giovanna Tinetti, Olivia Venot, Ravit Helled

NASA-ESA STATEMENT OF INTENT FOR MARS SAMPLE RETURN

This has been an exciting and productive week for the Mars Exploration
Program. On Thursday, April 26th, NASA and ESA signed a Statement of
Intent to jointly develop a Mars Sample Return plan to be submitted to
their respective authorities by the end of 2019. Those authorities, the
United States Congress via President's Budget Request and the ESA
Ministerial Council via their December 2019 meeting, would be expected
to act upon this request in 18 months. 

https://mepag.jpl.nasa.gov/announcements.cfm?expand=hq

This signing is historic, as it signals the desire, readiness, and
willingness to work together to execute this inspiring mission, one
that many of you have worked towards for many decades. It is the
product of more than a year of hard work between the partners. I firmly
believe that we are ready to tackle this grand challenge. We have the
scientific and operational maturity to identify the right samples, the
critical technologies are ready to be applied, and with discipline this
campaign can be executed affordably.

I am excited about this opportunity and ask everyone to join me in
making the effort successful.

Jim Watzin, NASA Mars Exploration Program Director

PLANETARY SIMULANT DATABASE

The University of Central Florida and the Center for Lunar & Asteroid
Surface Science SSERVI node have developed an online listing to track
the growing number of regolith simulants created in the past and
currently being developed. The listing is maintained at:

http://sciences.ucf.edu/class/planetary-simulant-database/

Simulants are organized by planetary body and by category (e.g.,
general purpose, geotechnical). We also highlight those that are
commercially available, or may be available in small batches from the
developers, with contact information where available. Each simulant
page contains literature references, the basic history of the simulant,
and any data available on mineralogy, bulk chemistry, and physical
properties.

Some data may be missing or inaccurate, and we welcome community input
to help make the listing as complete as possible, and to alert us to
new simulants that have been designed. In the future we plan to add
more datasets (spectra, particle size distributions), and create a JSON
backend to organize the simulant information.
