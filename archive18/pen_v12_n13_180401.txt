ASTRO-SCIENTISTS

The William Herschel and Royal Astronomical societies will celebrate 
promising early-career female astro-scientists* with a new Caroline 
Herschel prize: cash and two lectures.

This is a result of campaigning for greater recognition of Caroline's 
contribution to astronomy within the William Herschel Society, and one 
astronomer's £10,000-donation ($14,130) to inspire the prize-fund.

Thank you to all who supported the campaign.

Encourage young colleagues to apply:

EARLY CAREER RESEARCH ASSOCIATE AT CORNELL

The Planetary Remote Sensing group at Cornell University is seeking an 
early career Research Associate, (Postdoc equivalent), to join our 
diverse team. The position will be for an initial one‐year appointment, 
but is renewable with continuation for a second and third year 
contingent upon performance, and interest. Continuation beyond three 
years will be contingent on continued availability of funds. The nominal 
starting date is flexible. 

The successful candidate will work with Professor Alexander Hayes and 
his group, and closely collaborate with other members of the 
department (and their groups) including Professors Jonathan Lunine, 
Steven Squyres, and Philip Nicholson. While there is considerable 
latitude in the science program that can be pursued, specific topics 
of interest include numerical modeling and photogrammetric analysis 
with applications to Titan, 67P/Churyumov‐Gerasimenko, and Mars. 

Applicants should apply through Academic Jobs online:

JWST LAUNCH DELAY CAUSES POSTPONEMENT OF CYCLE 1 CALL FOR PROPOSAL 
DEADLINE

Based on recommendations made by the JWST Standing Review Board, NASA 
is re-scheduling JWST's launch window for 2020. Given those 
circumstances, STScI will delay the Cycle 1 GO/AR proposal deadline 
until no earlier than February 1 2019. A revised proposal schedule will 
be developed in consultation with the JWST Users Committee, the JWST 
Project and representatives from the European and Canadian Space 
Agencies. Proposals already submitted in response to the Cycle 1 Call 
will not be carried over and will need to be resubmitted. Finally, the 
GTO reserved targets in the Solar System may change if they are no 
longer observable during Cycle 1 - revisions to this list will be 
announced once determined.

EPSC 2018 SESSION: ORGANIC MATTER IN SPACE

16–21 September 2018 
Berlin, Germany 

https://meetingorganizer.copernicus.org/EPSC2018/session/29897

Abstract deadline: 16 May 2018, 13:00 CEST

Co-organized between the Small Bodies (SB) and Astrobiology (AB) 
programme groups.

Organic matter was abundant in the protosolar nebula, as attested by 
the wide range of organic compounds in the primitive bodies of our 
solar system, such as comets and carbonaceous chondrites. These 
organic compounds were delivered to the early Earth and may have 
played a role in the emergence of life. However, the origin of this 
organic matter remains debated. Is it synthesized in the protosolar 
nebula and/or inherited from the interstellar medium?  

This session invites communications on experimental, theoretical and 
observational studies related to the origin of organic matter in the 
primitive bodies, such as: a) detection and evolution of organic 
compounds in the interstellar medium, b) characterization and 
evolution of the organic matter in primitive bodies, c) distribution 
of organic matter in the protosolar disk, d) observation of organic 
matter in planetary surfaces.

Conveners: Vassilissa Vinogradoff, Grégoire Danger, Laurent Remusat.

CRYOVOLCANISM IN THE SOLAR SYSTEM WORKSHOP

Abstract Deadline: April 5th

Workshop date: June 5-6

Location: LPI in Houston, TX

This workshop aims to advance our understanding of the processes that 
may lead to extrusive and intrusive volcanism on the icy satellites, 
KBOs, and hydrous asteroids in our solar system. Specifically, we seek 
to resolve how and under what conditions volcanism and magmatism occur 
on these worlds and verify the likely mechanisms responsible for 
putative volcanic features and magmatic constructs that have been 
imaged by spacecraft.

We invite abstracts which focus on the generation, migration, and 
eruption of cryovolcanic fluids on the icy satellites, KBOs, and 
hydrous asteroids in our solar system. We welcome contributions 
pertaining to: the rheology and composition of aqueous solutions and 
other low-temperature liquids that may serve as cryovolcanic fluids; 
mechanisms for the transport of cryovolcanic fluids from the interior to 
the surface; laboratory work on low-temperature solutions, slurries, and 
cryogenic liquids; theoretical modeling and analysis of candidate 
cryovolcanic features; and plausible terrestrial analogs.

PSS SPECIAL ISSUE "ASTEROID (3200) PHAETHON AND METEOROIDS"

An international symposium "Int'l Symposium on Dust & Parent Bodies" 
(http://www.perc.it-chiba.ac.jp/meetings/IDP2018/Welcome.html) was held 
at PERC, Chiba Institute of Technology, in 2018 February 26-28. 
Following the discussions during the symposium, we plan to make a 
special issue on Planetary and Space Science (PSS) entitled "Asteroid 
(3200) Phaethon and meteoroids". We will call for research papers from
widely relevant fields. Any research subjects related to Phaethon or 
meteoroids from any viewpoint (observation, experiment, theory, 
simulation, exploration, and others) are welcome. Please refer to the 
submission procedure as follows:

LUNAR AND SMALL BODIES GRADUATE CONFERENCE 2018 

Abstract submission deadline: May 11, 2018

Registration is now open for the 8th Annual Lunar and Small Bodies 
Graduate Conference (LunGradCon 2018) to be held on Monday, June 25, 
2018 at the NASA Ames Research Center, preceding the NASA Exploration 
Science Forum (ESF, June 26-28). With the expanded interests of the 
Solar System Exploration Research Virtual Institute (SSERVI), the scope 
of this year's LunGradCon includes both lunar and small body science. 
LunGradCon provides an opportunity for grad students and early-career 
postdocs to present their research on lunar and small body science in a 
low-stress, friendly environment, being critiqued only by their peers. 
In addition to oral presentations, the conference presents 
opportunities for professional development and networking with fellow 
grad students and postdocs, as well as senior members of SSERVI. A 
limited amount of funding will be provided for travel and lodging costs. 
The deadline for LunGradCon registration and abstract submission is 
May 11, 2018, 11:59 PM PDT.
