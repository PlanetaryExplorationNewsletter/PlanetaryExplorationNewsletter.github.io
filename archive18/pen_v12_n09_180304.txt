NASA SEEKS EXPERIENCED PUBLIC POLICY EXPERTS

NASA's Science Mission Directorate (SMD) has an immediate need for one
or more experienced public policy experts to serve as Policy Analysts
under an Intergovernmental Personnel Act (IPA) appointment. The initial
IPA appointment will be for up to two years, with the possibility of
reappointment up to a total of six years. 

All applicants must be career employees from an IPA-eligible
organization (e.g., state and local governments, colleges and
universities, Indian tribal governments, federally funded research and
development centers, and other eligible organizations). Ideal
candidates would have an advanced degree in public policy or a related
field, and have experience working in public policy implementation. All
candidates must possess excellent policy analysis, writing and editing
skills. Prior experience working on space policy is desirable, but not
required. SMD's preferred start date is between July 1, 2018, and
August 15, 2018. More details are available online at:

https://science.nasa.gov/about-us/job-opportunities

Applicants should forward their resume or Curriculum Vitae to Dr. T.
Jens Feeley at jens.feeley@nasa.gov on or before March 9, 2018; if you
have any questions, you can reach Dr. Feeley at 202.358.1714.

JMARS SHOWCASE AT LPSC 

Monday, March 19, 2018 
12:00 noon 
Grogan's Mill Meeting Room

The Java Mission-planning and Analysis for Remote Sensing (JMARS) team
will host a series of short presentations by scientists who will
describe how they use this free, open-source GIS in their work. The
goal of these talks will be to showcase how to use JMARS to discover
available datasets, filter them to refine relevance, and fuse them with
one another in order to evaluate research hypotheses and produce
publication-quality results.

abstract submission information:

https://www.cps-jp.org/~akatsuki/venus2018/registration.html

Following the successful series of Venus conferences (La Thuile,
Aussois, Sicily, and Oxford), the Akatsuki team and community in Japan
are planning to host a Venus conference in 2018. The dates will be
11-14 September 2018 and the location will be a beautiful resort in
Hokkaido (it will not be skiing season though). The conference is
supported by the Fujihara Foundation of Science, so it is entitled "The
74th Fujihara Seminar".

The conference is intended to cover all areas of Venus science with
special focus on new results obtained from Japan's Venus Climate
Orbiter "Akatsuki". Results from previous missions, from ground-based
observations, numerical computations, and theoretical works are all
welcome.

NASA FDL 2018 SUMMER PROGRAM: CALL FOR APPLICANTS

NASA Frontier Development Lab (FDL) is an applied Artificial
Intelligence research accelerator that pairs researchers from the space
sciences with data scientists for an intense 8-week concentrated study
to apply AI to challenges important to space exploration and humankind.
FDL runs between June 25th - August 17, 2018.

We are looking for doctorate or post-doc researchers interested in the
following challenge areas:

Space Weather 
Astrobiology 
Space Resources

Additional challenges looking at orbital debris and exoplanets may be
added, pending partner interest.

This year we are also running a challenge in partnership with the
European Space Agency, which will run in parallel. FDL Europe's focus
will be on Earth Observation.

FDL is hosted by the SETI Institute and NASA Ames in Mountain View, CA;
and ESA Esrin in Europe. Compute and AI advisory is provided by IBM,
Intel, Nvidia, Lockheed Martin and Google.

Researchers will receive a stipend and are provided with accommodation
for the duration.

Applications will be accepted until the closing date of the 3rd of
April, although we encourage you to apply sooner to ensure a place.
