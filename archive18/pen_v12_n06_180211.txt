NEW POSTDOCTORAL POSITION AT MIT

Applications are invited for a postdoctoral position at MIT to work on 
the physical characterization of near-Earth objects. This position will 
be supervised by Dr. Francesca DeMeo. The postdoctoral associate will

PLANNING SOLAR SYSTEM OBSERVATIONS WITH JWST IN CYCLE-1

In light of the April 6, 2018, deadline for JWST Cycle-1 observing 
proposals, a 4-hour webinar will be held on February 13 from 10a-2p 
(EST) and will summarize JWST planning tools and their application to 
observations of solar system targets. These tools include the 
Astronomer's Proposal Tool (APT), Exposure Time Calculator (ETC), the 
Target Visibility Tool, and best practices for Solar System proposers.  
Operational constraints that affect observations of solar system 
targets will be summarized and include: bright limits, pointing 
constraints, track rates, and the impact of ephemeris uncertainties on 
certain observing modes. Science instrument capabilities and 
applications will be briefly summarized, but are described extensively 
in 12 papers in PASP v128, 959 & 960 (2016).

PLANETARY SESSIONS AT THE MAY GSA CORDILLERAN-ROCKY MOUNTAIN JOINT
MEETING

May 15-17, 2018
Flagstaff, AZ

We invite contributions to the following planetary sessions:

T21. Recent Advances in Planetary Geoscience. How the volume and
diversity of recent data sets have significantly advanced our
understanding of the geologic character and evolution of bodies in the
Solar System. 

T22. Earth as a Stepping Stone for Planetary Exploration. Terrestrial
research in the field and in the laboratory is necessary for advancing
planetary exploration. 

T23. Integrating Composition and Morphology: Keys to Constraining
Planetary Surface Processes from Spacecraft Data. Compositional
interpretations critically augment geomorphological and/or
sedimentological studies to yield a refined understanding of geologic
context and surface processes.

T24. Understanding Basin Environments and Evolution Beyond Earth.
Though topographic and structural basins exist beyond Earth, lack of
direct access makes deciphering exposed units a challenge.

There also will be a full-day post-conference field trip on May 18 to
planetary analog sites in northern Arizona (The Holey Tour).
 
Abstract deadline is February 20, 2018. More information can be
obtained at the meeting website:

VOLUNTEERS NEEDED FOR UPDATING VEXAG'S VENUS EXPLORATION DOCUMENTS 
IN 2018

In order to prepare for the upcoming Planetary Science Decadal Survey 
and a NASA-sponsored Venus Flagship Study, volunteers are needed to 
support a key Venus Exploration Analysis Group (VEXAG) effort for 2018 
of reviewing and updating our primary VEXAG Venus Exploration 
documents:

(1) Venus Exploration Goals, Objectives, and Investigations,
(2) Venus Exploration Technology Plan, and
(3) Venus Exploration Roadmap.

VEXAG  Focus Groups will be formed for each of these 3 documents. The 
schedule for completing this is:

- Kick-offs in March at LPSC
- Drafts for community review by the fall in time for the annual VEXAG 
  Meeting
- Final versions completed and posted by the end of 2018

If you are interested in participating in this effort, provide Bob 
Grimm, VEXAG Chair, (grimm@boulder.swri.edu) and Martha Gilmore, VEXAG 
Deputy Chair mgilmore@wesleyan.edu) with a short statement on your 
expertise and expected contribution by Friday, March 9, 2018.

NEW OPAG GOALS DOCUMENT POSTED FOR COMMUNITY COMMENTS

An extensively revised draft goals document for the Outer Planets 
Assessment Group has been posted at: 

https://www.lpi.usra.edu/opag/  

We invite the OPAG science community to provide feedback by using the 
OPAG Discussion Board: 

https://www.lpi.usra.edu/forums/viewforum.php?f=2  

To use this, you must have filled out a notification of interest form 
at: 

https://www.lpi.usra.edu/opag/opag.cfm

ENVIRONMENTS OF TERRESTRIAL PLANETS UNDER THE YOUNG SUN: SEEDS OF
BIOMOLECULES

9-13 April, 2018 
NASA Goddard Space Flight Center 
Greenbelt, MD, USA

Hosted by the Sellers Exoplanet Environments Collaboration, this 
symposium is a major international interdisciplinary conference in the 
emerging area of astrobiology covering astrophysical, physico-chemical, 
atmospheric and geological aspects of environments of early terrestrial 
planets with a focus on the impacts of the young Sun’s space weather on 
the precursors of life. 

The central objective of the Symposium is to unify and coordinate these 
efforts to understand, and characterize heliophysical, magnetospheric, 
ionospheric, climate and their interaction with geological environments 
on the early Earth, Mars and Venus and their impacts on the initiation 
of prebiotic chemistry.

The official web site for the symposium is available at: 

https://science.gsfc.nasa.gov/600/seec/Events
/Environments_of_Terrestrial_Planets_Under_the_Young_Sun.html

Please register and submit your abstract (at no cost) at:
