CALL FOR ABSTRACTS: QUATERNARY MARS SESSION AT THE INTERNATIONAL UNION
FOR QUATERNARY RESEARCH INTERNATIONAL CONGRESS
   
July 25-31 2019, Dublin, Ireland
 
Abstract deadline: 9th January 2019
 
We are soliciting abstracts for a session at International Union for
Quaternary Research (INQUA) 2019 focussed on the cross-fertilisation of
ideas between Quaternary Research and Mars research. We are especially
interested in contributions from authors working across planetary and
terrestrial themes, and from those with insights gained from Quaternary
research that have a bearing on the study of recent Mars.

The main issues we hope to discuss include climate and environment
changes on Earth and Mars, especially during what on Mars might be
called the "very late Amazonian" period. All contributions that examine
links between climate, orbit and geomorphology on Mars, are welcome, as
well as related studies on astrobiology, habitability, future
exploration and terrestrial analogue fieldwork.

INTERNATIONAL VENUS CONFERENCE ANNOUNCEMENT

31 May - 3 June 2019
Niseko, Hokkaido, Japan

The Akatsuki team and community in Japan will be hosting the 2019 
International Venus Conference a beautiful resort in Hokkaido (it 
will not be skiing season though). The conference is supported by 
the Fujihara Foundation of Science, so it is entitled "The 74th 
Fujihara Seminar".

The 2018 conference was postponed to 2019 due to the strong
Earthquake that struck Hokkaido just days before the conference was
meant to begin. If you were scheduled to attend that meeting, please
update your bookmarks from 2018 to 2019 in all URL's and email
addresses.

This conference is intended to cover all areas of Venus science with
special focus on new results obtained from Japan's Venus Climate
Orbiter "Akatsuki". Results from previous missions, from ground-based
observations, numerical computations, and theoretical works are all
welcome.

Abstract Submission and Registration is now open. The Earlybird 
abstract deadline is Monday, 25 February (JST). For more information
about the conference and updated registration and abstract submission 
information, go to:

[NASA] ROSES-18 AMENDMENT 43: NEW OPPORTUNITY IN C.29 ASTRODYNAMICS IN
SUPPORT OF ICY WORLDS MISSIONS

The new program element C.29 Astrodynamics in Support of Icy Worlds
Missions solicits the formulation, maturation, and validation of
promising astrodynamics analysis tools. The development of these
open-source codes has the potential to uncover new mission concepts,
motivate entirely new classes of missions that may not have been
previously considered, improve the efficiency of missions, and extend
mission life. Science missions to icy moons orbiting the solar system's
Giant Planets are of particular interest to NASA.

Step-1 proposals are due January 18, 2019 and Step-2 proposals are due
March 15, 2019.

WHOLE HELIOSPHERE & PLANETARY INTERACTIONS

It's solar minimum. In the tradition of Whole Sun Month (1996) and
Whole Heliosphere Interval (2008), it's time for Whole Heliosphere &
Planetary Interactions (2019) - WHPI!

Goal? A coordinated observing and modeling effort to characterize the
three-dimensional interconnected solar-heliospheric-planetary system.
By focussing on specific solar rotations near solar minimum, structures
and activity can be unambiguously traced throughout the heliosphere and
into planetary space environments.

When? Three target intervals:
 Jul 2019 - Solar eclipse
 Sep 2019 - Parker Solar Probe at perihelion
 Dec 2019 - Parker Solar Probe Venus flyby

Who? Everyone is welcome - it's a grassroots effort. Sign up - we will
have telecons and workshops to coordinate analyses.

observations made in lunar orbit. Manuscripts are solicited that
present analysis of data from Apollo, especially in light of recent
observations of the Moon. We also encourage submissions that take a
broader look at Apollo rather than with a focus on a single mission or
sample.

https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/hub/jgr/journal/21699100/
features/call-for-papers
