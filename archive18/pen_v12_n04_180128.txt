CLOSING PLANETARY PROTECTION KNOWLEDGE GAPS FOR FUTURE HUMAN
EXPLORATION WORKSHOP DELAYED 

New date: May 15-16, 2018
Lunar and Planetary Institute
Houston, TX

This 2nd COSPAR workshop on refining the planetary protection
requirements for human missions COSPAR, with support from ESA and NASA,
is pleased to announce the 2nd COSPAR workshop on refining the
planetary protection requirements for human missions, "Closing
Planetary Protection Knowledge Gaps for Future Human Missions", now to
be held May 15-16, 2018, at the Lunar and Planetary Institute in
Houston.

This workshop is an interdisciplinary meeting seeking to align
previously identified knowledge gaps in planetary protection with
mission opportunities in the timeframe between now and the first crewed
flight to the martian surface. This workshop will feed into subsequent
working meetings that produce COSPAR reports assessing potential
opportunities to address knowledge gaps in the areas of: i) Microbial
and human health monitoring; ii) Technology and operations for
contamination control; and iii) Natural transport of contamination on
Mars. Further information on agenda, logistics, registration and
opportunities for remote participation, will be available shortly. The
workshop seeks to ensure a balance of discipline specialty and
nationality among the participants. Accordingly, in person attendance
may be limited by the capacity of the facilities. 

Initial indications of interest in participation can be sent to
james.a.spry@nasa.gov.
 
Apologies, and Thanks!

MERCURY 2018 MEETING: ABSTRACT DEADLINE FEBRUARY 15, 2018
 
The abstract deadline for the Mercury 2018 Meeting: Current and Future
Science of the Innermost Planet is a few weeks away, on February 15,
2018. This meeting will focus on all scientific aspects of the planet
Mercury, including both the current state of knowledge and the
prospects for future endeavors. All scientific topics related to the
planet Mercury are welcome at this meeting.

In particular, we wanted to specifically note that contributions
related to the future exploration of Mercury beyond BepiColombo are
also sought. This meeting seeks to enable the Mercury science community
to have productive discussions, building on MESSENGER's results and
preparing for BepiColombo's new discoveries, while also considering
what are the top priorities for the next steps in the scientific
exploration of Mercury. Thus, abstracts on the speculative future
scientific exploration of Mercury are encouraged, and authors are
allowed more than one first-authored abstract to encourage such
submissions.

INVITATION TO SUBMIT ABSTRACT TO THE JAPAN GEOSCIENCE UNION (JPGU)
MEETING

At the Japanese Geoscience Union meeting near Tokyo, Japan, we will
convene an international session titled: "Outer Solar System
Exploration Today and Tomorrow"

http://www.jpgu.org/meeting_2018/SessionList_jp/detail/P-PS01.html

We invite abstracts that address a wide range of topics encompassing
the giant planets and their moons, including their origins, interiors,
atmospheres, compositions, surface features, and electromagnetic
fields. To advocate for current and future outer planets exploration
(Cassini, Juno, New Horizons, JUICE, and beyond), we also call for
discussions on future missions to explore giant planet systems,
including how to develop better international cooperation. Discussion
in this latter category will include progress in developing a solar
sail mission concept for observing the Jupiter system and its trojan
asteroids.

JpGU will be held on May 20 - 24 in Makuhari, Chiba.

http://www.jpgu.org/meeting_e2018/index.php

Early Abstract deadline (discounted rate): February 5th, 2018
Regular Abstract Deadline: February 19th, 2018
Early Registration Deadline: May 8, 2018

Current AGU Members can register at the JpGU member rate.

PLANETARY SESSIONS AT THE MAY GSA CORDILLERAN-ROCKY MOUNTAIN JOINT
MEETING

May 15-17, 2018
Flagstaff, AZ

We invite contributions to the following planetary sessions:

T21. Recent Advances in Planetary Geoscience. How the volume and
diversity of recent data sets have significantly advanced our
understanding of the geologic character and evolution of bodies in the
Solar System. 

T22. Earth as a Stepping Stone for Planetary Exploration. Terrestrial
research in the field and in the laboratory is necessary for advancing
planetary exploration. 

T23. Integrating Composition and Morphology: Keys to Constraining
Planetary Surface Processes from Spacecraft Data. Compositional
interpretations critically augment geomorphological and/or
sedimentological studies to yield a refined understanding of geologic
context and surface processes.

T24. Understanding Basin Environments and Evolution Beyond Earth.
Though topographic and structural basins exist beyond Earth, lack of
direct access makes deciphering exposed units a challenge.

There also will be a full-day post-conference field trip on May 18 to
planetary analog sites in northern Arizona (The Holey Tour).
 
Abstract deadline is February 20, 2018. More information can be
obtained at the meeting website:
