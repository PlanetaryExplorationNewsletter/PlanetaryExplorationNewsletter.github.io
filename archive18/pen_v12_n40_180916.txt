We are pleased to announce a workshop addressing scientific and 
technological topics relevant to the in situ exploration of ice giant 
planet atmospheres, including scientific questions, how to achieve 
them, and technological challenges. The workshop will also focus on 
potential mission concepts and international cooperation, with an 
emphasis on probe studies of the ice giants in the framework of future 
NASA-ESA collaborations.

Information regarding registration, lodging, abstract submission, and 
the venue will be posted on the workshop website in November.

THE SSHADE SOLID SPECTROSCOPY DATABASE FOR ASTROPHYSICS AND PLANETARY 
SCIENCES

http://www.sshade.eu

The European SSHADE database infrastructure on spectroscopy of solids
already offers on-line over 1500 spectroscopic data on various types of
solids. They are provided by a consortium of 21 experimental groups
covering expertises in various types of samples, spectral ranges and
techniques.

The data are intended to help astronomers and astrophysicists to
interpret spectro-photometric observations of surfaces and aerosols
obtained from telescopes and space missions.

The measured samples include ices, minerals, rocks, organic and
carbonaceous materials and also liquids. They are either synthesized
in the laboratory, natural terrestrial analogs collected or measured in
the field, or extraterrestrial samples collected on Earth or from 
extraterrestrial sources (e.g., meteorites, IDPs, lunar soils).

So don't hesitate to search SSHADE for relevant laboratory data to
compare with your observations or to feed your numerical model using 
the search/visualization/export tools on www.sshade.eu. New data are
regularly ingested and new user's tools will be added.

Users tutorials will be held at EPSC (Berlin, 17-21 September 2018) 
and DPS (Knoxville, 22-26 October 2018)

NEW DATES FOR THE PLUTO-2019 CONFERENCE (PSANH)

The dates for the Pluto System After New Horizons (PSANH), an 
international science conference on the Pluto system and the Kuiper 
Belt, have shifted by two days to July 14-18, 2019 (Sunday through 
Thursday). The venue remains the same: the conference will be held at 
the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory in Laurel, MD.

Please mark your calendars accordingly!

Further information on the PSANH Conference is available at:

CHANGE IN NSF PLANETARY ASTRONOMY GRANTS PROGRAM

After the end of the current government fiscal year FY 2018 
(30 September 2018), the National Science Foundation’s Division of 
Astronomical Sciences will no longer accept proposals submitted to the 
Solar and Planetary Research Grants (SPG; NSF 16-602) pilot 
'no-deadline' program.  Beginning in FY 2019 (1 October 2018), 
proposals that address topics related to solar and planetary systems 
- including exoplanets, our own solar system, and physics of the Sun – 
should once again be submitted in response to the Astronomy and 
Astrophysics Research Grants (AAG) program (new solicitation NSF 
18-575). Proposals to AAG are due by 15 November 2018. 

Questions may be directed to NSF Program Officers Faith Vilas 
(fvilas@nsf.gov), David Boboltz (dboboltz@nsf.gov), Linda French 
(lfrench@nsf.gov), or James Neff (jneff@nsf.gov).

ROSES-18 AMENDMENT 26: DRAFT LUNAR SURFACE INSTRUMENT AND TECHNOLOGY
PAYLOADS CALL FOR COMMUNITY COMMENT

This is a draft of a call for proposals for Lunar Surface Instrument 
and Technology Payloads (LSITP) to be integrated onto and delivered to 
the lunar surface by commercial lunar landers. This program element 
would solicit flight payloads that do not require significant 
additional development. Investigations are sought that address the 
science goals of any of the four divisions (Planetary, Earth Science, 
Heliophysics, Astrophysics) of the Science Mission Directorate (SMD) as 
well as Strategic Knowledge Gaps of the Human Exploration and 
Operations Mission Directorate (HEOMD) or any technology demonstration 
goals of the Space Technology Mission Directorate (STMD) that advance 
capabilities for science, exploration, or commercial development of the 
Moon.

This ROSES element invites proposals for complete, Principal 
Investigator led science instrument or technology investigations. The 
first lander flight opportunity could occur as early as 2020. As such, 
proposals should convincingly demonstrate that the proposed payload 
will be ready to support an aggressive launch schedule.

Send comments to Sarah.Noble-1@nasa.gov by September 27, 2018. These 
may result in changes to a FAQ or questions and answer document. 
Anonymity of persons/institutions who submit questions will be 
preserved.

THEMATIC SCHOOL - FLUID-ROCK INTERACTIONS IN THE SOLAR SYSTEM

The Laboratoire de Planetologie et Geodynamique organises the second 
GeoPlaNet thematic school on Fluid-Rock Interactions in the Solar 
System. The event will take place in Nantes (France), November 12-16,
2018.

This school in Planetary Geosciences will present to participants 
various techniques for observing, analysing, experimenting and 
modelling the compositional and morphological aspects of fluid-rock 
interactions in rocky and icy bodies of all sizes of the Solar System.

The school will include lectures and practicals, as well as poster 
presentations by attendees. It will be organised along two themes:

(1) Fluid-rock interactions on planetary surfaces:

Fluid-related rock deformation, rock weathering, sedimentation, 
hydrothermalism;
Spectroscopy of rocks and minerals, field excursion, experimental 
modelling, laboratory analyses;

(2) Fluid-rock interactions in planetary interiors:

Icy ocean worlds, mantle dynamics, volatile cycle, metasomatism, deep 
magmatic source;
Petrology, geochemistry, geophysics, laboratory analyses, 
experimentation, numerical modelling.

This high-level training program is open to 80 international Master 
students, Ph.D. students and young researchers with a background in 
Geosciences and/or in Planetary Science.

DPS PANEL DISCUSSION: CARBON IN THE SOLAR SYSTEM 

Sunday, October 21, 2018, 3-6 PM

As part of the SSERVI-sponsored series of workshops on Carbon in the 
Solar System, we will be holding a panel discussion called "Processed 
or Primitive?” on Sunday, Oct 21, 3-6 PM. Recent investigations within 
our Solar System, including the Pluto system, the Saturn system, 
Mercury, and nearly all points in between, point to carbon in some 
form on many bodies, though its nature is often elusive. The event will 
assemble a panel of experts to discuss carbon in the solar system (in 
meteorites and on planetary surfaces) and in the interstellar medium, 
and the relationships between them. How processed are the carbon 
compounds found across the solar system, compared to the carbon in the 
ISM? How does the processing occur, and on what timescales? What 
future measurements can help us to better understand carbon in our 
solar system?

We hope to see you there, for what is sure to be an engaging 
discussion!
