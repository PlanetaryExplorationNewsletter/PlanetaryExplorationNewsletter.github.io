[NASA] RESPONSE DATE EXTENDED FOR SCIENCE ENGAGEMENT OPPORTUNITUES FOR 
THE NASA MARS 2020 PROJECT

NASA seeks proposals from commercial, educational, or non-profit 
organizations to partner with NASA on a non-reimbursable, i.e., 
no-exchange-of-funds, basis to define, organize, and execute a contest 
for K-12 students in U.S. schools to select a name for the Mars 2020 
rover launching in 2020.

NASA will now accept responses until 11:59 pm Eastern time, October 29, 
2018, an extension of 20 days.

The AFP is available on NSPIRES at: 

https://go.nasa.gov/2M7yLnk 

Interested parties are encouraged to read the AFP carefully, as it 
differs significantly from a funding announcement-type solicitation.

Send questions by email to:

hqmars2020namingproposals@mail.nasa.gov 

AFP questions and responses, with identifying information removed, 
will be posted as Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) at:

[NASA] ROSES-18 AMENDMENT 30: TESS GI TEXT AND DUE DATE CHANGES

The TESS Guest Investigator (GI) Program solicits proposals for the 
acquisition and analysis of scientific data from the Transiting 
Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) mission, a NASA Explorer mission that 
launched in April 2018 and began regular science operations in July 
2018. Observations associated with the TESS Guest Investigator (GI) 
Cycle 2 solicitation will be collected during the second year of 
operations during which the spacecraft will survey the northern 
ecliptic hemisphere. Proposals submitted to this program should be for 
new science investigations of the northern ecliptic hemisphere and 
outside the TESS core science program.

The due date for Phase-1 proposals is delayed to to February 28, 2019, 
4:30 pm Eastern time. Via: 

https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/ark/rps

A number of changes are made throughout the text, most significantly in 
Section 2.2.1.

[NASA] ROSES-18 AMENDMENT 31: C.15 PLANETARY PROTECTION RESEARCH 
PROGRAM NOT SOLICITED THIS YEAR

Because of the delayed schedule for review of proposals to PPR-2017 and 
in order to give the new program manager time to convene the 
multi-Directorate coordination group to get input on Agency planetary 
protection needs, NASA has decided to solicit PPRP early in ROSES-2019 
rather than in ROSES-2018. 

Questions concerning this program element may be directed to Becky 
McCauley Rench via email at: rebecca.l.mccauleyrench@nasa.gov

APPLICATIONS SOLICITED FOR TENURE-TRACK ASSISTANT PROFESSOR

The Department of Physics/Astronomy and Department of Geology at 
Western Washington University (WWU) invite applications for a tenure 
track Assistant Professor of Planetary Science. This position has an 
expected start date of September 2019, and will be split evenly between 
the two departments, with Physics as the administrative lead department 
for purposes of annual review, tenure and promotion. Teaching 
assignments will be focused in Geophysics, a program shared between the 
departments.

We seek applicants whose research and teaching examines the role of 
physical processes in planet formation and evolution, planetary 
interiors, surfaces, atmospheres and/or magnetospheres, small bodies, 
solar system dynamics, or related topics. The preferred candidate will 
be expected to develop and maintain a vigorous research program that 
complements existing strengths in remote sensing, planetary geology, 
seismology, magnetism, and tectonics, to engage students in this 
research, and to teach undergraduate courses at all levels, using 
student-centered instructional approaches when appropriate.

DPS WORKSHOP: PRIMITIVE OR PROCESSED? CARBON IN TODAY'S SOLAR SYSTEM
VS. THE EARLY SOLAR SYSTEM AND THE INTERSTELLAR MEDIUM

As part of the SSERVI-sponsored series of workshops on Carbon in the 
Solar System, we will be holding a panel discussion at DPS called 
"Primitive or Processed?" Recent investigations within our Solar 
System, including the Pluto system, the Saturn system, Mercury, and 
nearly all points in between, point to carbon in some form on many 
bodies, though its nature is often elusive. The event will assemble a 
panel of experts (see below) to discuss carbon in the solar system (in 
meteorites and on planetary surfaces) and in the interstellar medium, 
and the relationships between them. How processed are the carbon 
compounds found across the solar system, compared to the carbon in the 
ISM? How does the processing occur, and on what timescales? What 
future measurements can help us to better understand carbon in our 
solar system?

Expert panelists include Dr. Yvonne Pendleton (NASA Ames), Dr. Diane 
Wooden (NASA Ames) and Dr. Kelly Miller (SwRI San Antonio). We hope 
you'll join us for an engaging discussion!

CHONDRULES: RECORDS OF PROTOPLANETARY DISC PROCESSES

Chondrules provide an important record of the conditions of the Solar 
System in pre-planetary times. Edited by Sara S. Russell, Harold C. 
Connolly Jr and Alexander N. Krot, this book presents an overview of 
state-of-the-art research into the properties and possible formation 
mechanisms of chondrules, providing insight into the evolution of the 
solar protoplanetary disk. With contributions from leading 
cosmochemists and astrophysicists, this book is an invaluable reference 
for researchers and graduate students interested in meteorites, 
planetary accretion and Solar System dynamics. More details, including
