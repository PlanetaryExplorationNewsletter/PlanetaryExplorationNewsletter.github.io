AGU SESSION GP009: PLANETARY MAGNETISM AND CORE PROCESSES

We're excited to invite you to submit abstracts to the session
"Planetary Magnetism and Core Processes" for the upcoming fall AGU
meeting.

We seek contributions from a wide range of disciplines to foster
discussions and research connecting the properties of planetary cores
to the magnetic fields they produce.

Planetary magnetism provides a window into the evolution of planets,
moons, and early planetesimals from exosphere to core. At the same
time, investigating the composition, dynamics, and thermal evolution of
planetary cores is also critical for predicting the behavior and
evolution of dynamo fields. In this session, we aim to foster
interdisciplinary conversations between investigators studying
magnetics and planetary interiors. As such, this session calls for
contributions relating to observational, experimental, and
theoretical/modeling work in the areas of: 1) core composition, 2) core
dynamics, 3) planetary thermal evolution, 4) dynamos, 5) crustal
magnetism, 6) paleomagnetism, 7) magnetospheres.

AGU SESSION P005: BEING NEIGHBORLY - OBSERVING THE MOON FROM CIS-LUNAR
SPACE 

Regular access to cis-lunar space is projected to be possible in the
near future ushering in a new area of lunar exploration. Cis-lunar
space expands the types of lunar observations possible, filling a gap
in capability between ground-based observatories and lunar missions. 
Small missions can readily access cis-lunar space, which is also the
destination of the proposed Lunar Orbital Platform-Gateway. This
potentially enables the deployment and operation of both low-resource
instruments as well as highly capable instruments and experiments for
observing and monitoring the Moon including the cis-lunar environment.
This session solicits abstracts for lunar science and instrumentation
possible from cis-lunar space including near-rectilinear halo orbits
(NRHOs).

AGU SESSION P008: CERES AND VESTA - UNDERSTANDING THE PROTOPLANETS OF
THE ASTEROID BELT
 
Many of the outstanding questions about Vesta and Ceres have been
addressed by analyzing data from the Dawn mission. A comprehensive
mapping campaign was undertaken at both bodies, as well as studies of
their compositions, geophysical properties, and interiors, which
enabled new understanding of their place in the history of our Solar
System. Although, prior to Dawn, thought to be currently geologically
inactive, with surfaces modified primarily by impacts, there is
evidence for magmatic activity on Vesta, cryovolcanism on Ceres, and
tectonic processes on both. Dawn's second extended mission from the
planned 35-km pericenter altitude orbit promises new observations by
the time of the meeting that will enable characterization of Ceres at
unprecedented resolution. We encourage abstract submissions related to
geologic, geophysical, spectroscopic and compositional analyses of
Ceres and Vesta. Possible topics include analyses of Dawn data,
telescopic observations, modeling and laboratory experiments.
Comparative analyses with other bodies are welcome. 

Abstracts are due August 1st.

AGU SESSION P014: DEFENSE AGAINST ASTEROID IMPACTS
 
This session is listed under SWIRL Theme Extreme Events and Hazards.
 
Session Description: Planetary defense against asteroid impacts is an
active field of research, which involves ground-based observations of
small bodies, numerical modeling of deflection techniques, laboratory
experiments, and space mission projects and technology developments.
The asteroid impact hazard is the only natural hazard that can be
predicted and prevented with feasible means, and it is inherently an
international issue. NASA has undertaken the first demonstration and
test of asteroid deflection using a kinetic impactor, and ESA is
studying an orbiter spacecraft. This work has triggered important
planetary defense activities: (i) definition and coordination of
technology needs and requirements for planetary defense, (ii) modelling
and simulations of impact outcomes including benchmarking of available
simulation tools, (iii) remote sensing observations, instrument payload
developments for in situ characterization, and definition of
close-proximity operations. This session will discuss the various
elements and their current state.

AGU SESSION P038: RESULTS FROM THE INVESTIGATION OF JUPITER'S
ATMOSPHERE BY JUNO AND A SUPPORTING CAMPAIGN OF EARTH-BASED 
OBSERVATIONS

You are invited to submit abstracts to Juno-related 2018 AGU Fall
Sessions by the August 1 deadline.

Primary convener: Glenn S. Orton; Conveners: Scott Bolton, Cheng Li,
Gordon Bjoraker

NASA's Juno mission operates a spacecraft in 53-day polar orbits around
Jupiter, with the ultimate goals of understanding Jupiter's origin and
evolution. One specific objective is to establish the structure,
composition and dynamics of the deep atmosphere and its relationship
with the upper atmosphere. Juno's polar orbit with close approaches
near the terminator only a few thousand kilometers above the cloud tops
provides the opportunity to characterize poorly explored polar regions
and to study the characteristics of cloud dynamics and composition at
spatial resolutions as fine as 6 km. An integral part of Juno's
exploration is a campaign of Earth-based observations that extend and
enhance spacecraft results by complementing Juno's spatial, temporal
and spectral coverage. This session welcomes presentations involving
all results obtained by and in support of the Juno mission, including
not only results of Juno and Earth-supporting observations but also
theoretical modeling of atmospheric structure, composition and
dynamics.

AGU SESSION P044: SUPER-EARTH DETECTION, CHARACTERIZATION AND MODELING
- HOW HABITABLE ARE THEY?

Abstract deadline: August 1, 2018

https://agu.confex.com/agu/fm18/prelim.cgi/Session/51966

Transit detections and radial velocity measurements have shown the
existence of numerous exoplanets larger than Earth, yet of bulk density
comparable to a rocky world: super-Earths. Within the next two years,
the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) mission is expected to
significantly increase the number of super-Earth detections, which will
need to be characterized, especially in terms of their habitability in
our search for exo-life. This can be achieved via observations of
multiple types but it also requires a deep knowledge of the physical
processes at play in their interiors to build reliable models. This
session seeks to improve our understanding of super-Earths and their
habitability from an observational, experimental and theoretical
perspective through a wide range of disciplines, including but not
limited to planetary sciences, mineral physics, exobiology,
geochemistry and geodynamics.

AGU SESSION P046: THE NEW MARS UNDERGROUND - SCIENCE AND EXPLORATION OF
A NEW DEEP FRONTIER 
  
The Martian underground within a depth of a few miles is of enormous
interest for planetary sciences. But so far, studies and exploration of
Mars' subsurface have taken a back seat to exploration of its surface.
This is now changing with the imminent Mars InSight (NASA) & ExoMars
(ESA) missions, Mars Sample Return calling for a deeper understanding
of the shallow Mars subsurface, plans for human exploration, and as
better technical capabilities and scientific understanding finally
enable accessing the Mars underground. We seek contributions that
encompass the nature and diversity of Mars crustal subsurface
environments (modeling, experiments, observations) or the tools for
exploring them (sounding, drilling, cave explorer robotics, in situ
analysis techniques). Broad themes are related to the
distribution/cycling of subsurface water (ice/liquid), brines and other
volatiles, the astrobiological (extinct or extant life) and ISRU
potential of Mars' subsurface, and the technologies and mission
concepts that enable such exploration.

AGU SESSION P049: THE INTERIORS OF JUPITER AND SATURN IN THE ERA OF
JUNO AND CASSINI

You are invited to submit abstracts to Juno-related 2018 AGU Fall
Sessions by the August 1 deadline.
      
Primary Convener: David Stevenson
Conveners: Hao Cao, Scott Bolton, Luciano Iess
     
The ongoing Juno mission and the recently concluded Cassini mission
have provided a wealth of new measurements (e.g. gravity field,
magnetic field, composition, seismic waves) revealing key aspects of
the interiors of Jupiter and Saturn for the first time. Examining these
new measurements from both planets, separating common themes from
specific expressions, is a critical step towards a coherent
understanding of the formation, evolution, and interior dynamics of
giant planets in the solar system and beyond. This session will bring
together observation and interpretation of gravity field, magnetic
field, composition, seismic waves at Jupiter and Saturn. Topics will
include depth of strong differential rotation (zonal flows), helium and
heavy element abundance, generation of intrinsic magnetic field,
existence and properties of the central core, seismic, thermal, and
magnetic consequences of stable stratification, as well as formation
scenarios and evolution pathways.

AGU SESSION P055: TIDALLY LOCKED SYSTEMS IN THE SOLAR SYSTEM AND BEYOND

Section/Focus Group: Planetary Sciences 
 
What can the planetary icy moons, exoplanets and dynamics of planetary
systems communities learn from each other? Terrestrial planets around G
stars within Earth's orbit may be tidally locked. Tidally locked icy
moons within our solar system have tidal stresses believed to give rise
to geologic activity and liquid water subsurface oceans in Europa &
Enceladus, surface volcanism on Io, while Earth's moon took a
different trajectory. We believe that most Earth-like planets around
M-dwarf systems such as Trappist-1 are tidally locked and tidal
stresses may play a role in their geothermal heat fluxes. We invite
submissions that address key questions and ideas regarding tidally
locked systems, particularly those that bridge communities and offer
points of discussion. What are the geodynamic consequences of tidal
locking?  What are the observable signatures of these processes in the
solar system and exoplanets? What are the consequences for
habitability? Can any challenges be overcome?

SH029: THE INTERSTELLAR PROBE MISSION: NASA STUDY FINDINGS AND NEXT
STEPS
 
Abstract Submission: 

https://agu.confex.com/agu/fm18/prelim.cgi/Session/48708
 
The Interstellar Probe would be first dedicated mission to venture in
to the unknown space between our star and other potentially habitable
planetary systems. In 2016, congress recommended NASA to take the
enabling steps for an Interstellar scientific probe. NASA has now
directed a study of an Interstellar Probe targeting 1000 AU within 50
years. The study objectives are to identify science targets, develop
mission concepts and evaluate critical technologies. Science targets
include exploration of the Very Local Interstellar Medium and its
interaction with the heliosphere, characterization of the circum-solar
dust, flybys of unexplored Kuiper Belt Objects, and putting these
observations in the context of other exoplanetary systems and
astrospheres. This session reports on the findings spanning the science
discoveries enabled by an Interstellar Probe and its mission design,
but also seeks contributions on other scientific targets, enabling
technologies, mission concepts and programmatic challenges.

AGU SESSION SM03: OUR EVOLVING UNDERSTANDING OF AURORAL PROCESSES AND
MAGNETOSPHERE DYNAMICS AT JUPITER THROUGH JUNO AND EARTH-BASED
OBSERVATIONS

You are invited to submit abstracts to Juno-related 2018 AGU Fall
Sessions by the August 1 deadline.
 
Primary convener: Robert Ebert; Conveners: Scott Bolton, George Clark,
Masafumi Imai
     
Our view and understanding of Jupiter's auroras and magnetosphere are
ever-changing as Juno continues to explore these regions in situ with
coordinated efforts from Earth-based observatories such as Hubble,
Hisaki, Keck, etc. These new measurements have illuminated new and
exciting discoveries that are challenging our theoretical ideas. This
session seeks submissions covering new observations and
interpretations, theories, and models of Jupiter's auroral regions,
magnetosphere and/or ionosphere and their connection. Specifically,
this session will cover the following topics: observation and theory of
auroral acceleration including wave-particle interactions; auroral
phenomenology, magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling; plasma sheet
dynamics; outer boundary structure and dynamics, and particle
acceleration and transport. This session aims to share the most recent
observations and ideas regarding Jupiter's magnetosphere, while
providing a forum that takes a multidisciplinary approach to furthering
our knowledge of this system.

ROSES-18 AMENDMENT 17: NEW OPPORTUNITY IN C.25 SESAME TECHNOLOGY
DEVELOPMENT
  
The Scientific Exploration Subsurface Access Mechanism for Europa
(SESAME) technology development opportunity supports the formulation
and maturation of system concepts and the associated technologies
capable of penetrating ice and accessing the subsurface liquid water on
ocean worlds such as Europa. The overall goal of this opportunity is to
define, and ultimately validate, a realistic architecture for deep (>1
km) subsurface access under flight-like constraints. In addition, the
endeavor seeks to identify, address, and reduce technical risks for the
most promising ice-penetration systems so that these systems may
eventually be infused into potential future flight opportunities. This
program does not solicit technologies or hardware for a specific flight
opportunity.
  
Step-1 proposals are due by July 27, 2018, and Step-2 proposals are due
by September 28, 2018.
