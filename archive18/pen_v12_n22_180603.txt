[NASA] K2 GO CYCLE 7 FINAL TEXT RELEASED
 
ROSES-18 Amendment 14 releases final text for K2 Guest Observer (GO) 
Cycle 7, program element D.7. Owing to the limited amount of spacecraft 
fuel remaining, Cycle 7 is comprised of Campaign 20 only. Go to:
 
http://nspires.nasaprs.com/ 

This program element solicits proposals for the acquisition and 
analysis of new scientific data from the K2 mission. K2 repurposes the 
space-borne hardware and ground-based operations of the Kepler mission 
for a pointed survey of predetermined locations along the ecliptic 
plane. This provides a powerful tool for broadband variability analyses 
of planetary, stellar, extragalactic, and solar system sources.

Contingent on the spacecraft health and fuel condition, K2 is 
soliciting proposals for Guest Observer (GO) Cycle 7 targets, and is 
comprised of Campaign 20 only. Phase-1 proposals, including target 
lists and a scientific rationale, are requested by July 19, 2018. If 
the spacecraft health and fuel allow, then Phase-2 proposals will be 
due January 17, 2019. Go to:

This month's topic is "What is happening in Titan's equatorial belt?"
Contributed by Jeremy Brossier, Deutsches Zentrum fur Luft- und 
Raumfahrt (DLR), Institute of Planetary Research, Berlin, Germany.

VENUS LANDED PLATFORM WORKING GROUP

NASA has convened a Venus Landed Platform Working Group to assess high 
priority science investigations that are needed on the surface of 
Venus. Topic areas include Venus surface geology and geochemistry, 
atmospheric chemistry and dynamics, interior processes, and 
surface-atmosphere interactions. This includes investigations that 
may be enabled by new technology approaches, such as extended duration 
landers via active cooling or high temperature electronics, or using 
surface mobility. Individuals who would like to suggest important 
science investigations should please send a short description of the 
science question being addressed, the measurements required to answer 
the science question, and key technical requirements such as 
measurement duration or mobility requirements. Please send this input 
to the following individuals:

Martha Gilmore, mgilmore@wesleyan.edu
Natasha Johnson, natasha.m. johnson@nasa.gov
Walter Kiefer, kiefer@lpi.usra.edu
Jonathan Sauder, jonathan.sauder@jpl.nasa.gov

The Working Group's first meeting begins on June 19.
