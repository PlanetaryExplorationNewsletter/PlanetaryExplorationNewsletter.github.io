EUROPA DEEP DIVE 2 WORKSHOP

Abstracts Deadline (extended): August 9, 2018
 
https://www.hou.usra.edu/meetings/europadeepdive2018/
 
We encourage all members of the planetary science community whose
research interests lie in Europa's chemical composition to submit
abstracts for oral and poster presentations. The workshop is structured
to provide ample time for oral presentations (at least 15 min), poster
sessions, and discussion of Europa's chemistry as revealed by
Observations, Data Analysis, Modeling, and Laboratory Work. This is
your unique opportunity to hear and to be heard in an environment
where ample time will be devoted to these topics.
 
The common thread of the Workshop is to assess our present
understanding of Europa's composition (physical and chemical), evaluate
the existing laboratory data, and summarize critical laboratory work to
be conducted in the immediate future. We therefore solicit abstracts
with a focus on observational data, spectral/modeling work, and
laboratory data. Presenters are also encouraged to include discussions
of any laboratory data that is needed or that would enhance their work.
 
Please feel free to contact members of the Deep Dive 2 SOC with any
questions.

FIRST ANNOUCEMENT IAU SYMPOSIUM 350 ON LABORATORY ASTROPHYSICS

Please save the date!

The First International Astronomical Union Symposium on Laboratory
Astrophysics, IAUS 350: Laboratory Astrophysics: from Observations to
Interpretation, will be held in Cambridge, UK, from 14 - 19 April 2019.

The active synergy between astronomical observation, laboratory
experiment and theoretical modeling has been reinforced at the 2015 IAU
General Assembly by the creation of a new IAU Commission (CB5) on
Laboratory Astrophysics.

https://www.iau.org/science/scientific_bodies/commissions/B5/

In this meeting we hope to build on this momentum and bring together
active researchers in observational astronomy, space missions,
experimental and theoretical laboratory astrophysics and astrochemistry
to discuss the major topics and challenges that face today's Astronomy.
We expect that interactions between researchers will result in a solid
roadmap for future research.

To register your interest in this meeting, please send an email to
IAUS350-labastro2019@open.ac.uk. You will then receive regular updates
on the meeting.

AGU SESSION B039: INTEGRATED HABITABILITY SCIENCE: FORECASTING THE
TRAJECTORY OF LIFE AND PLANETARY HABITABILITY ON EARTH AND BEYOND
 
The Earth has experienced several catastrophic perturbations during its
history, but nevertheless remained habitable. How will planet Earth and
life co-evolve in the future? How will life adapt and transform itself
across the environmental changes ahead of us? How will life continue to
shape the Earth? How do microbial life and ecosystems naturally adapt
to and co-evolve on human to geologic timescales? How can we enhance
the Earth's habitability and expand sustainability into the deep
future? This session has a special focus on the evolving planetary
processes and the extent of life and its diversification that both
contribute to the maintenance of Earth's habitability. We welcome
interdisciplinary topics related to systems life science and synthetic
biology, exploration of deep life and ecosystems in extreme
environments, limits and theories of life, and modeling of the Earth's
habitability and geosphere-biosphere interactions in the past, present,
and deep future.

AGU SESSION P006: CARBON ACROSS THE SOLAR SYSTEM

We invite you to submit an abstract to our session on carbon in the
Solar System at the 2018 AGU Fall Meeting in Washington, DC, December
10-14, 2018.

Recent results ranging from the Pluto system, the Saturn system, other
locations beyond 5 AU, all the way to Mercury in the inner Solar
System, and nearly all points in between, raise questions abut the
state of carbon in the Solar System: how do carbonaceous compounds
become weathered in response to thermal processes and irradiation? How
do we recognize carbon compounds and their various weathering products?
The synthesis of these results improves our scientific understanding of
the role of carbon in the Solar System, how it evolves and how to
recognize it. The carbonaceous near-Earth asteroids 162173 Ryugu and
101955 Bennu will be sampled in the next few years; the analyses of
these samples will provide context for the presence of carbon. In this
session, abstracts covering observational, laboratory and modeling work
related to carbon and carbonaceous species on Solar System bodies are
welcome.

AGU SESSION P009: CHASING LIFE WITH A SAMPLE SIZE OF ONE - FROM SIGNS
OF LIFE IN EARTH'S ATMOSPHERE TO EXOPLANET BIOSIGNATURES
 
Because Earth is the only planet known to harbor life, the search
should start here. From Earth, we can continue to identify potential
biosignatures and ponder the challenges that exist for detecting these
conditions on exoplanets. Using Earth as a first-approximation,
atmospheric climate models of exoplanets are being developed, and
researchers are imagining how those models would be different under
various conditions by incorporating data from exoplanet observations.
We solicit new research in: using remote sensing datasets for Earth as
a reference case, studying the evolution of life's detectability on
Earth, mitigating observational and biosignature detectability
challenges,  and assessing how the Earth-model may be expected to
change for a planet formed under different circumstances around another
star (e.g., how increased stellar activity and extreme events may
impact climate, habitability, and the detectability of biosignatures,
especially work that uses Earth-Sun interactions as an analog, for the
present day and early Earth).

AGU SESSION P024: INTEGRATING GEOPHYSICAL METHODS FOR IMPROVED IMAGING
OF PLANETARY SURFACES AND INTERIORS

The AGU 2018 Fall Meeting will be held on 10-14 December 2018 in
Washington, DC. We would like to draw your attention to the session
P024: Integrating Geophysical Methods for Improved Imaging of Planetary
Surfaces and Interiors, and invite you to submit an abstract. We
encourage submissions that illustrate how combinations of geophysical
methods can be used to optimize imaging of planetary interiors, both
shallow and deep. Of particular interest are studies that illustrate
resolution capabilities that can come from integrating several methods
(potential fields, electromagnetic and radar methods, seismics,
drone-scale imaging, and other novel methods). For example, how could
imaging of the geometry and internal structure of lava flows, magmatic
processes, and/or regolith properties, be improved through novel
combinations of geophysical measurements?

AGU SESSION P025: MACHINE LEARNING IN PLANETARY SCIENCE: INTRODUCTIONS
AND APPLICATIONS

Machine Learning (ML) is the subfield of computer science that gives
"computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed."
As increasingly large nonlinear datasets are acquired, autonomy and
machine intelligence have to play a more critical role in the
interpretation of data from planetary exploration missions. There is a
need for frameworks that can rapidly and intelligently extract
information from these datasets in a manner useful for scientific
analysis. The community is starting to respond to this need by applying
machine learning approaches on various levels. This session will
present ways on introducing machine learning into your workflow and
explore research that leverages machine learning methods to enhance our
scientific understanding of planetary data, increasing the return of
planetary exploration missions. This does include data analysis on
ground as well as on board a spacecraft to increase autonomy and/or
decrease data volume and novel approaches to mission timeline planning.

GSA SESSION T143. THE AGE OF SMALL WORLD EXPLORATION: MAJOR RESULTS
FROM MINOR PLANETS AND OTHER SMALL SOLAR SYSTEM BODIES

NASA and other space agencies have recently conducted, and continue to
conduct, an impressive number of robotic spacecraft missions focused on
the exploration of "small worlds" such as (but not limited to)
asteroids, comets, and the comparatively large dwarf planets.
Characterizing and constraining the structure, composition, geology,
and tectonics of small worlds is essential for a more complete
understanding of universal geological processes, solar system
chemistry, and the very formation of planets such as the Earth.

We welcome abstract submissions related to the geological, geophysical,
and/or compositional analysis of rocky and icy small worlds (e.g. main
belt asteroids, Trojan asteroids, comets, and rocky/icy dwarf planets),
through the use of spacecraft data, telescopic observations, modeling
studies, laboratory investigations and/or comparative studies. We also
welcome abstracts related to the planned future exploration of small
worlds in our solar system.
