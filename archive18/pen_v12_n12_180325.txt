2018 NASA PLANETARY SCIENCE SUMMER SEMINAR APPLICATIONS OPEN
 
NASA is accepting applications - from science and engineering
post-docs, recent PhDs, doctoral students, engineering students within
6-9 months of completion of their master's degree but not planning to
pursue a PhD degree, and junior faculty - for its 30th Annual Planetary
Science Summer Seminar, which will be held August 6-10, 2018 at the Jet
Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif.

During the program and pre-session webinars, student teams will carry
out the equivalent of an early mission concept study, prepare a
proposal authorization presentation, present it to a review board, and
receive feedback. By the end of the session, students will have a
clearer understanding of the life cycle of a space mission;
relationships between mission design, cost, and schedule; and the
tradeoffs necessary to stay within cost and schedule while preserving
the quality of science.

Applications are due April 2, 2018. Partial financial support is
available for a limited number of individuals. Further information is
available at: 

http://psss.jpl.nasa.gov

NASA FDL 2018 SUMMER PROGRAM: APPLICATIONS CLOSING SOON

NASA Frontier Development Lab (FDL) is an applied Artificial
Intelligence research accelerator that pairs researchers from the space
sciences with data scientists for an intense 8-week concentrat-ed study
to apply AI to challenges important to space exploration and humankind.
FDL runs between June 25th - August 17, 2018.

We are looking for doctorate or post-doc researchers interested in the
following challenge areas:

Space Weather 
Astrobiology 
Space Resources

Additional challenges looking at orbital debris and exoplanets may be
added, pending partner interest.

This year we are also running a challenge in partnership with the
European Space Agency, which will run in parallel. FDL Europeâ€™s focus
will be on Earth Observation.

FDL is hosted by the SETI Institute and NASA Ames in Mountain View, CA;
and ESA Esrin in Europe. Compute and AI advisory is provided by IBM,
Intel, Nvidia, Lockheed Martin and Google.

Researchers will receive a stipend and are provided with accommodation
for the duration.

Applications will be accepted until the closing date of the 3rd of
April.

Apply now at:
