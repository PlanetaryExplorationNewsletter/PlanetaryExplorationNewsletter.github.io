AGU SESSION P023: IMPACTS OF SPACE WATHER FROM THE SUN AND ACTIVE STARS
ON ATMOSPHERIC EVOLUTION OF TERRESTRIAL (EXO)PLANETS

Section/Focus Group: Planetary Sciences

Recent explosion of the discovered terrestrial exoplanets around active
G-M dwarfs raises a fundamental question about how to detect habitable
worlds. Recently detected superflares on late-type stars and associated
space weather in the form of XUV emission, coronal mass ejection and
solar energetic particle events can cause atmospheric erosion and
chemical changes. These factors may present significant challenges for
surface habitability. The proposed session invites theoretical,
observational and laboratory studies that shed light on factors of
atmospheric ion and neutral escape from the current and early Earth,
Mars and exoplanetary atmospheres including chemical changes due to
various factors of space weather.

AGU SESSION P026:  MARS GLOBAL CLIMATE MODELING: FROM THE SURFACE TO 
THE EXOBASE

Dear Colleagues,

We invite you to consider submitting an AGU abstract to our special
session.

https://agu.confex.com/agu/fm18/prelim.cgi/Session/53132

Global climate models (GCMs) are used in conjunction with a variety of
observational data sets to address critical questions regarding the
climate of Mars and how it has evolved over time. There are now many
groups worldwide that develop and use Mars GCMs, employing a variety of
representations of relevant physical processes. The goal of this
session is to bring together scientists from different climate modeling
groups to discuss the current state of models, future development
plans, and recent scientific insights from climate modeling efforts.
Contributions are solicited that focus on modeling strategies as they
pertain to the development of advanced physics routines, modern
geophysical fluid global frameworks, and the application of such
numerical tools toward questions relating to the past, current and
future climates of Mars. This includes, but is not limited to, the
physical representation of sub-grid scale mixing, cloud microphysics,
dust lifting, radiative transfer, and photochemistry.

AGU SESSION P033: PLANET MERCURY - PRESENT UNDERSTANDING AND PROMISE 
FOR FUTURE DISCOVERY

We are pleased to announce a session on Mercury at the 2018 AGU Fall
Meeting in Washington, DC, December 10-14, 2018.

Our understanding of Mercury's surface, interior, exosphere, and
magnetosphere has been revolutionized by data returned by NASA's
MESSENGER mission. With the launch of the ESA-JAXA BepiColombo dual
spacecraft mission to Mercury in October this year, that understanding
will take another substantial step forward. We solicit contributed
papers on data analysis, laboratory measurements, ground-based
observations, and theoretical developments that build on the current
state of knowledge of Mercury. We also welcome papers on how questions
raised by MESSENGER findings can be addressed by future observations
expected from BepiColombo.

Please consider submitting an abstract for this session. For more
information,visit:

AGU SESSION P038: RESULTS FROM THE INVESTIGATION OF JUPITER'S 
ATMOSPHERE BY JUNO AND A SUPPORTING CAMPAIGN OF EARTH-BASED 
OBSERVATIONS
 
You are invited to submit abstracts to Juno-related 2018 AGU Fall
Sessions by the August 1 deadline.

Conveners: Scott Bolton, Cheng Li, Gordon Bjoraker
 
NASA's Juno mission operates a spacecraft in 53-day polar orbits around
Jupiter, with the ultimate goals of understanding Jupiter's origin and
evolution. One specific objective is to establish the structure,
composition and dynamics of the deep atmosphere and its relationship
with the upper atmosphere. Juno's polar orbit with close approaches
near the terminator only a few thousand kilometers above the cloud tops
provides the opportunity to characterize poorly explored polar regions
and to study the characteristics of cloud dynamics and composition at
spatial resolutions as fine as 6 km. An integral part of Juno's
exploration is a campaign of Earth-based observations that extend and
enhance spacecraft results by complementing Juno's spatial, temporal
and spectral coverage. This session welcomes presentations involving
all results obtained by and in support of the Juno mission, including
not only results of Juno and Earth-supporting observations but also
theoretical modeling of atmospheric structure, composition and
dynamics.

AGU SESSION P049: THE INTERIORS OF JUPITER AND SATURN IN THE ERA OF 
JUNO AND CASSINI
 
You are invited to submit abstracts to Juno-related 2018 AGU Fall
Sessions by the August 1 deadline.

The ongoing Juno mission and the recently concluded Cassini mission
have provided a wealth of new measurements (e.g. gravity field,
magnetic field, composition, seismic waves) revealing key aspects of
the interiors of Jupiter and Saturn for the first time. Examining these
new measurements from both planets, separating common themes from
specific expressions, is a critical step towards a coherent
understanding of the formation, evolution, and interior dynamics of
giant planets in the solar system and beyond. This session will bring
together observation and interpretation of gravity field, magnetic
field, composition, seismic waves at Jupiter and Saturn. Topics will
include depth of strong differential rotation (zonal flows), helium and
heavy element abundance, generation of intrinsic magnetic field,
existence and properties of the central core, seismic, thermal, and
magnetic consequences of stable stratification, as well as formation
scenarios and evolution pathways.

AGU SESSION P051: THE ROLE OF EXTREME ATMOSPHERIC ESCAPE FROM HOT 
EXOPLANETS 

Section/Focus Group: Planetary Sciences 

https://agu.confex.com/agu/fm18/gateway.cgi 
 
One of the most significant advances in planetary science has been the
discovery of a large and incredibly diverse population of extrasolar
planets thanks to recent surveys like the Kepler mission. Follow-up
observations have shown that these planets have a wide range of
compositions and atmospheric properties. However, these planets are
also typically on short-period highly irradiated orbits where their
atmospheres are bombarded by an extreme environment that can include
intense XUV irradiation, highly energetic giant impacts, strong tidal
forces, and interactions with stellar winds and CMEs. In order to
understand these populations it is therefore essential that we examine
the physical processes that govern the retention or loss of planetary
atmospheres under extreme conditions, as well as the constraints that
we can place on these processes from exoplanet observations.

AGU SESSION P056: TITAN - LOOKING BACKWARD, LOOKING FORWARD  

During the Cassini-Huygens mission from 2004 to 2017, Titan was
revealed like never before: from the discovery of surface lakes and
seas, dune fields and rare impact craters; through the meteorology of
the neutral atmosphere; to the chemical melting pot of the ionosphere,
where the seeds of organic particles that cover Titan's surface are
born. Much of the Cassini-Huygens dataset has only been partially
explored, and many more discoveries await therein. While the
Cassini-Huygens dataset is complete, ground and space-based telescopes
continue to point at Titan, and computer modeling and laboratory
experimentation continue apace. Looking further ahead, new missions
such as the proposed APL Dragonfly aerorover, promise that we will not
be absent from Titan for long. In this session, scientific
presentations are solicited to cover the whole spectrum of current
Titan research, from interpretation of past mission data, experimental
and observational work, and modeling for future missions.

Abstract are due August 1st.

AGU SESSION P058: UNANSWERED QUESTIONS IN MARS ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCE 
- WHAT FUTURE OBSERVATIONS ARE BEST SUITED TO ADDRESSING THEM?

We invite you to submit an abstract to this session by Wednesday, 1
August 23:59 EDT.

https://agu.confex.com/agu/fm18/prelim.cgi/Session/52581

Our understanding of the Martian atmosphere and processes affecting it
has advanced significantly in the last two decades, thanks in large
part to the suite of Mars-orbiting sensors that have provided unique
insights into atmospheric structure and variability. However,
significant uncertainties remain, particularly related to the role of
the atmosphere in the Martian dust and water cycles. New observations
are needed to make progress on many of these issues. For example,
multiple studies have identified vertical profiles of wind and water
vapor as two such outstanding measurement needs. This session welcomes
papers that elucidate the remaining questions and link them to
observational needs. Studies that quantify performance requirements on
such observations (resolution, uncertainty, coverage etc.), including
through reference to model atmospheres and study and/or assimilation of
simulated measurements, are particularly encouraged. Papers that
identify specific future measurement approaches and instruments, and
quantify their capabilities are also solicited.

AGU SESSION SM011: MOON-PLASMA INTERACTIONS THROUGHOUT THE SOLAR SYSTEM

We cordially invite you to submit abstract to the Moon-Plasma
Interactions Throughout the Solar System Session at the 2018 AGU Fall
Meeting.

This session is Co-Organized with Planetary Sciences.

Link: https://agu.confex.com/agu/fm18/prelim.cgi/Session/42874

This session will focus on new observational and theoretical studies of
the interaction between the moons of our solar system and the
magnetized plasmas incident upon them. This includes plasma
interactions with the solid surfaces, atmospheres, dust environments,
and intrinsic and induced magnetic fields of the moons, both inside and
outside of their parent planets' magnetospheres. Of special interest
are results related to in-situ field and particle measurements near the
terrestrial moon and from Cassini's flybys of Saturn's icy satellites
Enceladus, Rhea and Dione. Studies deepening our understanding of the
interconnection between Titan's ionosphere and its highly dynamic
magnetospheric environment are also very welcome. The interaction of
Jupiter's moons with the ambient magnetospheric plasma will be
addressed with a view to provide support to the ongoing Juno Mission
and the planning of synergistic measurements for the upcoming JUICE
Mission. Comparative studies of the various moon-plasma interaction
scenarios are particularly welcome.

AGU SESSION SM013: OUR EVOLVING UNDERSTANDING OF AURORAL PROCESSES AND
MAGNETOSPHERE DYNAMICS AT JUPITER THROUGH JUNO AND EARTH-BASED 
OBSERVATIONS

Session Description: Our view and understanding of Jupiter's auroras
and magnetosphere are ever-changing as Juno continues to explore these
regions in situ with coordinated efforts from Earth-based observatories
such as Hubble, Hisaki, Keck, etc. These new measurements have
illuminated new and exciting discoveries that are challenging our
theoretical ideas. This session seeks submissions covering new
observations and interpretations, theories, and models of Jupiter's
auroral regions, magnetosphere and/or ionosphere and their connection.
Specifically, this session will cover the following topics: observation
and theory of auroral acceleration including wave-particle
interactions; auroral phenomenology, magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling;
plasma sheet dynamics; outer boundary structure and dynamics, and
particle acceleration and transport.

This session aims to share the most recent observations and ideas
regarding Jupiter's magnetosphere, while providing a forum that takes a
multidisciplinary approach to furthering our knowledge of this system.
