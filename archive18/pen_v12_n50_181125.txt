2019 PIERAZZO INTERNATIONAL STUDENT TRAVEL AWARD

Application deadline: 9 PM MST, November 29, 2018

Awards will be announced on or before December 10, 2018

This award is established by the Planetary Science Institute in memory
of Senior Scientist Betty Pierazzo to support and encourage graduate
students to build international collaborations and relationships in
planetary science. Two awards will be made each year, contingent upon
there being meritorious applications. One will be awarded to a
graduate student working on his or her Ph.D. at an institution within
the U.S. This is to support travel to a planetary science related
meeting (conferences and workshops) outside of the U.S. The second
award will be to a graduate student working on his or her Ph.D. at an
institution outside of the U.S. This is to support travel to a
planetary science related meeting within the U.S. These include
general meetings that have planetary-focused sessions such as the AGU,
GSA, EGU and IAG.

The award will consist of a certificate and up to $2000US.

GSA PLANETARY GEOLOGY DIVISION G.K. GILBERT AWARD NOMINATIONS

Due: December 1, 2018
 
Greetings Planetary Community!
 
Please be advised that nominations for the GSA Planetary Geology
Division's highest honor, the G. K. Gilbert Award, are due December 1,
2018. Established in 1983, the G. K. Gilbert Award is presented
annually by the Planetary Geology Division of the Geological Society of
America for outstanding contributions to the solution of fundamental
problems in planetary geology in the broadest sense, which includes
geochemistry, mineralogy, petrology, geophysics, geologic mapping, and
remote sensing. Such contributions may consist either of a single
outstanding publication or a series of publications that have had great
influence in the field. The award is named for the pioneering geologist
Grove Karl Gilbert, who was an influential early American geologist.

Nominations should be sent directly to the award committee chair, Brad
Thomson (bthom@utk.edu). Nominations should include a cover letter
detailing the accomplishments of the nominee, supporting letters from
colleagues, and a current CV. A list of past recipients can be viewed
here:

ANNOUNCEMENT FOR PLANETARY SCIENTIST ENGAGEMENT INSTITUTE

The Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory's VORTICES
program and the Lunar and Planetary Institute are conducting a
Planetary Science Engagement Institute for planetary scientists
interested in engaging public audiences in planetary science and solar
system exploration. Hear from a variety of experts on public
engagement. Content will include common solar system misconceptions,
techniques for addressing controversial topics, simple activities and
demonstrations for engaging audiences, connecting with local museums
and astronomy clubs, and more.

This free event starts at 1pm on Friday, December 14, continues after
dinner until 8pm, and concludes at 3 pm on Saturday, December 15. We
are planning an optional tour of APL on Friday morning (tour is for
U.S. Citizens Only); more details will be added as they become
available. Institute registration is free, and includes dinner on
December 14 and lunch on December 15. Limited travel stipends of $500
to $1,000 are available for US citizens, depending on the distance
traveled.

DEADLINE FOR SUPPORT APPROACHING EGU2019 PLANETARY GEOMORPHOLOGY

A reminder that the deadline is fast approaching for financial support
at EGU 2019 (Vienna Austria 7-12 April) including for the Planetary
Geomorphology session GM1.5/PS1.2. Support is available for students,
early career and established scientists and your abstract must be
submitted by 1st Dec deadline to be eligible. The Planetary
Geomorphology session welcomes abstracts concerning landforms,
landscapes and the processes that shape them on all solar system
bodies. Novel approaches using remote sensing data, Earth analogue
studies and flume/simulation work and are particularly encouraged. This
session provides a stimulating forum for cross-disciplinary discussion
so join us once again for a mix of geomorphology and planetary science.

Norbert Shorghofer
Planetary Science Institute

https://www.crcpress.com/Lessons-in-Scientific-Computing-Numerical-
Mathematics-Computer-Technology/Schorghofer/p/book/9781138070585

Taking an interdisciplinary approach, this new book provides a modern
introduction to scientific computing, exploring numerical methods,
computer technology, and their interconnections, which are treated with
the goal of facilitating scientific research across all disciplines.
Written with an eye on usefulness, longevity, and breadth, Lessons in
Scientific Computing will serve as a "one stop shop" for mathematically
versed students taking a unified course in scientific computing, and
researchers from multiple disciplines. The book provides a unique
combination of numerical analysis, computer programming, and computer
hardware in a single text. It includes essential topics such as
numerical methods, approximation theory, parallel computing,
algorithms, and examples of computational discoveries in science, and
is not wedded to a specific programming language.
