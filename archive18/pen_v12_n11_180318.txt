RESEARCH ASSOCIATE JOB POSTING FOR THE CORNELL CENTER FOR ASTROPHYSICS
AND PLANETARY SCIENCE
 
The Planetary Remote Sensing group at Cornell University is seeking a
Research Associate to join our diverse team. The position will be for
an initial one year appointment, but is renewable with continuation for
a second and third year contingent upon performance, and interest.
Continuation beyond three years will be contingent on continued
availability of funds. The nominal starting date is flexible.

The successful candidate will work with Professor Alexander Hayes and
his group, and closely collaborate with other members of the department
(and their groups) including Professors Jonathan Lunine, Steven
Squyres, and Philip Nicholson. While there is considerable latitude in
the science program that can be pursued, specific topics of interest
include numerical modeling and photogrammetric analysis with
applications to Titan, 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, and Mars. Applicants
should apply through Academic Jobs online:

EARTHARXIV PREPRINT SERVICE EXPANDING TO INCLUDE PLANETARY SCIENCE

EarthArXiv is a free community-led preprint service for the Earth
sciences. Our goal is to enhance scholarly communication and make
research more widely accessible. Recognizing the scientific overlap
between Earth and planetary science domains, EarthArXiv has recently
expanded its indexing and search taxonomy to include planetary science
terminology. Examples include, but are not limited to, planetary
geology and geophysics. EarthArXiv welcomes preprint manuscript
submissions from the planetary community as well scholarly
communication and preprint enthusiasts who want to join us as Community
Ambassadors.

MEPAG MEETING 36: FORUM PRESENTATION ABSTRACTS NOW POSTED

Mars community members,
 
We received 27 abstracts for presentation within the MEPAG Meeting 36
forum (to be held on the first day of the April 3-5 meeting); these
abstracts are now viewable on the meeting website:

https://mepag.jpl.nasa.gov/meetings.cfm?expand=m36. 

The abstracts span a wide range of concepts, and we look forward to the
forum and subsequent meeting discussion! The forum's presentations and
discussion will be summarized in day 2 of the MEPAG meeting, and feed
into MEPAG preparation for the next Planetary Science Decadal Survey.

Further information about the forum poster presentations (including
instructions for presenters) will be posted to the website later this
week. Please send questions about the forum or any other aspect of the
MEPAG meeting to mepagmeetingqs@jpl.nasa.gov.
 
Thank you!

GOLDSCHMIDT CONFERENCE SESSION ANNOUNCEMENT

Please consider contributing to the following session at Goldschmidt:

01e: The Chemistry, Observations, and Modelling of Planetary Assembly
by Stephen Mojzsis, Ramon Brasser, Mihkel Kama and Amy Bonsor

Mysteries that surround the physical-chemical nature of the inner
regions of planetary systems are slowly being unravelled. This progress
is being driven by clues from meteorites, dynamical simulations, and
observations of extrasolar systems. Such insights from home and abroad
are refining our models of planet formation which incorporate dust,
planetesimal, and planet growth; mixing and migration; and astro- and
cosmochemistry. This session firstly aims to review recent advances;
secondly to increase mutual understanding between the geochemical,
solar system, planet formation, and exoplanet communities; and thirdly
to form a complete perspective on the formation of (in particular,
silicate-metal) planets. Suggested topics cover the composition and
chemistry; structure; and chronology of planet-forming material and
planets. We seek input from all areas of planetary geochemistry, astro-
and cosmochemistry, and astronomical observations and modelling, to
further our understanding of planet formation in the solar system and
beyond.

WALK ON MARS WITH THEMIS AT LPSC

The 2001 Mars Odyssey spacecraft and the Thermal Emission Imaging
System (THEMIS) have been acquiring infrared images of Mars for more
than 16 years. The best-quality images from the mission have been
compiled into a global mosaic at 100 m/pixel resolution and printed on
a walkable basketball court-sized vinyl mat for education and public
outreach events. Come join the Odyssey and THEMIS teams in celebrating
16 years at Mars by walking across the Red Planet for yourself!

OCEAN WORLDS 3: ABSTRACT DEADLINE EXTENDED TO MARCH 28

The abstract deadline for the Ocean Worlds 3 meeting has been extended
to Wed. March 28, 2018 5:00 PM CDT. Ocean Worlds 3 will be held May
21-24, 2018 at the Lunar and Planetary Institute, Universities Space
Research Association, Houston, Texas. The focus will be on the
potential for silicate-water interactions to occur on Ocean Worlds
beyond Earth, from a multi-disciplinary and inter-disciplinary
perspective. As with past Ocean Worlds meetings, a primary motivation
is to engender a cross-fertilization of ideas and expertise by
soliciting contributions from both the Ocean Sciences and Planetary
Sciences communities. Consequently, contributions are invited that
address any aspects of this broad water-rock interaction theme, across
the Planetary and Ocean Science fields, including geophysics,
hydrogeology, geochemistry and microbiology.

AIDA/DART SPRING 2018 INVESTIGATION TEAM MEETING

Second Announcement and Registration Reminder
Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory, Laurel MD

The DART Investigation Team will have a one-day meeting on 9 April
2018. This meeting will be used to discuss the status of DART and the
collaborative AIDA project, present work done by the Investigation Team
during DART's Preliminary Design Phase ("Phase B"), and prepare for a
possible transition to Final Design and Fabrication Phase ("Phase C")
later in 2018. We welcome community interest and participation in
general discussion, and plan to provide for remote access.

Registration is required for onsite participants so that we can
generate a visitor log, but there is no registration fee and no
abstracts are solicited. We note that it is particularly important for
people who are not US citizens to register by the deadline. We will not
be able to accommodate non-citizen walk-ins. The registration deadline

[NASA] USE OF RTGS IN THE NEXT DISCOVERY AO

After analysis and consultation with the Department of Energy, NASA’s
Planetary Science Division is pleased to announce that the ban on the
use of Radio-isotope Power Systems (RPSs) by proposers responding to
the upcoming Discovery 2018 AO has been removed. Proposers will be able
to include the use of up to two (2) Multi-mission Radio-Isotope Thermal
Generators (MMRTGs) to enable or significantly enhance their mission
concept. Costs to be borne by proposers for the MMRTGs, the related
environmental impact assessments, and the required Nuclear Launch
Approval process will be announced once determined.

50TH ANNIVERSARY SCREENING OF 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY THIS APRIL 3RD
 
The National Museum of American History marks the 50th anniversary of a
film that launched many a planetary science career with a screening
this Tuesday, April 3rd at 6 PM. The screening will be followed by a
book talk by Michael Benson, the author of a new book on the production
of the film, Space Odyssey: Stanley Kubrick, Arthur C. Clarke, and the
Making of a Masterpiece. Benson's book, to be published on April 3rd by
Simon & Schuster, examines the making of the film from Kubrick's first
meetings with Clarke in 1964 all the way to 2001's rocky release and
legacy in 1968. In a starred review, Publisher's Weekly wrote "In its
way, this story about the making of 2001 is as compelling and
eye-opening as the film itself," and both Martin Scorsese and Tom Hanks
have provided glowing blurbs for the book's cover. As for 2001, it
remains not only the greatest science fiction movie of all time, but
among the greatest films of any kind ever made.
