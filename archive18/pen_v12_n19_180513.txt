EPSC SESSION: OCEAN WORLDS AND ICY MOONS 

European Planetary Science Congress (EPSC) 2018
Berlin, Germany
16-21 September 2018

Deadline: 16 May 2018, 13:00 CEST

https://www.epsc2018.eu/home.html

This session (OPS3) will deal with icy moons in the outer solar system 
with potential liquid  oceans underneath or, in Titan's case, on their 
surfaces. Focus is on the Jovian and Saturnian satellites and the 
future missions to explore them. This session will aim to present new 
and review papers on the current status of astrobiological knowledge 
about the worlds in the outer solar system with possible subsurface 
liquid water oceans.

Looking forward to meet you in Berlin!

Co-conveners: A. Hayes, J. Lebreton, O. Witasse,, A. Coustenis, 
E. Turtle, F. Tosi

EPSC SESSION: PLANETARY AERONOMY

We invite your contributions to a special session on Planetary Aeronomy 
at EPSC 2018 in Berlin, Germany (September 16-21, 2018):

https://meetingorganizer.copernicus.org/EPSC2018/session/29889

The aim of this session is to bring together researchers studying solar 
system and exoplanet upper atmospheres to exchange knowledge and ideas 
while learning of new results in this expanding area of research. We 
welcome papers on all aspects of planetary upper atmospheres in the 
solar and exoplanet systems, including observations and models that 
bear on photochemistry and ionization, magnetosphere-ionosphere 
coupling, energy balance, circulation and atmospheric escape. 
Contributions that allow us to better understand planetary evolution 
and the mass-radius diagram of exoplanets are also encouraged.     
 
Please submit your abstracts by the EPSC abstract deadline of 
Wednesday, May 16, 2018.

EPSC SESSION: DIFFERENTIATED SMALL BODIES - A NEW PERSPECTIVE

Deadline: 16 May 2018, 13:00 CEST

Dear Colleagues,

We invite you to submit abstracts to our session SB5: "Differentiated 
small bodies: a new perspective".

The latest findings of basaltic objects not dynamically connected with 
Vesta and laboratory studies on HED and iron meteorites suggest the 
presence of several differentiated planetesimals. However, in meteorite 
collections we have samples for the nucleus and the crust, but not from 
the mantle, with a missing olivine problem. The same occurs in the main 
belt, where we find a large number of metal-rich and silicate-rich 
asteroids, but very few olivine-rich.

Contributors are kindly invited to submit presentations on the latest 
findings on:

1) basaltic asteroids in the solar system, particularly on V-type 
asteroids not dynamically connected with the Vesta family;

2) the scarcity of A-type olivine-dominated asteroids from both 
asteroid surveys and meteorite collections; 

3) the compositional analysis of the population of iron-rich, 
"core-like" metallic asteroids, also in the light of the future Psyche 
mission;

4) compositional studies on asteroid families.

For more info:

Looking forward to meet you in Berlin!

ASP CONFERENCE ON ASTRO EDUCATION/OUTREACH

September 10-13, 2018

The ASP is resuming its three-day education and outreach conferences, 
this year in the Wine Country north of San Francisco. For more 
information, see: 

https://www.astrosociety.org/about-us/asp-annual-meetings
/asp-2018-annual-meeting/ 

Panels and discussions are being organized on a number of topics, 
such as using social media for outreach, diversity and the impostor 
syndrome, tools for teaching astronomy on-line, citizen science, and 
much more. Abstracts are now being accepted and registration for the 
meeting (and for discounted hotel rooms) is now open.

FREE OPEN SOURCE ASTRO 101 TEXTBOOK

In the last year, at least 90,000 students have used Astronomy, the 
free, open-source astronomy textbook published by OpenStax, a 
non-profit project at Rice University. (We say at least, since we only 
have information about registers adopters, and some people are using 
all or part of the book without the optional registration. Registered 
adopters get access to answers to the questions in the book and other 
materials for instructors.) For access to the book, which some 70 of 
your colleagues helped update and review, go to:

POST-DOC IN MACHINE LEARNING/DATA MINING FOR EARTH AND PLANETARY 
SCIENCE

Information science has developed modern research through innovative 
tools for mathematical modeling, simulation, big data, machine 
learning, data mining, deep learning, high-performance computing, and 
image processing. Earth and Planetary Science is one of the areas 
where the impact is potentially huge: instruments become extremely 
productive with the ability to obtain complex information on billions 
of objects. The range of application will depend on the candidate and 
could encompass geomorphology characterization (including crater 
detection), imaging-spectroscopy, geochemistry, etc.

The grant includes salary, equipment and mission costs. An extra 
engineer will be also hired for this project.

This project will benefit from the local Center of Data Science:

https://www.datascience-paris-saclay.fr/

Please send your CV as soon as possible, in any case before 18th May 
2018.

Condition: PhD defense after 31st December 2010
Location: Universite Paris Saclay, GEOPS, France
Duration: 3 years, starting in 2019.

LUNAR AND SMALL BODIES GRADUATE CONFERENCE 2018 

The 8th Annual Lunar and Small Bodies Graduate Conference 
(LunGradCon 2018) will be held on Monday, June 25, 2018 at the NASA 
Ames Research Center, preceding the NASA Exploration Science Forum 
(ESF, June 26-28). With the expanded interests of the Solar System 
Exploration Research Virtual Institute (SSERVI), the scope of this 
year's LunGradCon includes both lunar and small body science. 
LunGradCon provides an opportunity for grad students and early-career 
postdocs to present their research on lunar and small body science in 
a low-stress, friendly environment, being critiqued only by their 
peers. In addition to oral presentations, the conference presents 
opportunities for professional development and networking with fellow 
grad students and postdocs, as well as senior members of SSERVI. A 
limited amount of funding will be provided for travel and lodging 
costs.
