34TH AMERICAN SOCIETY FOR GRAVITATIONAL AND SPACE RESEARCH CONFERENCE
 
31 October to 3 November 2018
Bethesda North Marriot Hotel & Conference Center
Rockville, Maryland Deadline is 15 June 2018
 
We are pleased to issue a Call for Abstracts for the 33rd annual
American Society for Gravitational and Space Research (ASGSR)
conference. The meeting will take place 31 October to 3 November 2018
at the Bethesda North Marriot Hotel & Conference Center Rockville, MD.
The annual ASGSR meeting provides a forum for the Life and Physical
Sciences communities to meet and discuss their latest findings in
gravitational and space research.

You are invited to submit an abstract electronically no later than 15
June 2018 using the abstract submittal form and instructions posted at:

http://asgsr.org

All submitted abstracts will be peer reviewed by the conference
organizing committee. Accepted abstracts by authors registered for the
conference are published in the meeting program. The program is
distributed at the meeting and available on-line. Authors are strongly
encouraged to submit a full manuscript to the Journal of Gravitational
and Space Research (ASGSR's refereed journal). Abstract notification
will be emailed to authors no earlier than 30 July 2018.

[NASA] ROSES-18 AMENDMENT 12: NEW OPPORTUNITY IN C.24 APOLLO NEXT
GENERATION SAMPLE ANALYSIS
  
The goal of the Apollo Next Generation Sample Analysis (ANGSA) Program
is to maximize the science derived from samples returned by the Apollo
Program in preparation for future lunar missions anticipated in the
2020s and beyond. To achieve this, ANGSA solicits research on specially
curated materials from the Apollo 15, 16, and 17 sample collections,
which were returned to Earth in 1971-72.
 
The ANGSA program will consider only proposals that focus on the
analysis of the following list of Apollo samples, although proposers
are welcome to include other lunar samples in their studies to help
understand the specially curated samples.

Notices of Intent to propose are requested by June 22, 2018, and
proposals are due by August 21, 2018.

This amendment (NNH18ZDA001N) will be posted on the NASA research
opportunity homepage at:

http://nspires.nasaprs.com/ 

Questions: Jeff Grossman and Sarah Noble at HQ-ANGSA@mail.nasa.gov.

FIELD TRAINING AND RESEARCH PROGRAM AT METEOR CRATER

Deadline Approaching: June 11, 2018

October 6-14, 2018
Barringer Meteorite Crater, Arizona
 
The LPI-JSC Center for Lunar Science and Exploration is excited to
announce a student field camp opportunity coming this fall. The Field
Training and Research Program at Meteor Crater is organized under the
auspices of the NASA Solar System Exploration Research Virtual
Institute (SSERVI), which is designed, in part, to train a new
generation of explorers for the Moon and beyond.

This is a week-long geology field class and research project based at
Barringer Meteorite Crater, Arizona, more popularly known as Meteor
Crater. The goal is to introduce students to impact cratering processes
and provide an opportunity to assist with a research project at the
crater. Skills developed during the field camp should better prepare
the students for their own thesis studies in impact cratered terrains,
whether on Earth, the Moon, asteroids, Mars, or some other solar system
planetary surface.

The field camp is designed for graduate students in geology and
planetary science programs, although advanced undergraduate students
will be considered. U.S. and international students are eligible.

APPLICATIONS FOR GSA PLANETARY GEOLOGY DIVISION JUNIOR STUDENT ADVISORY
MEMBER DUE JUNE 1

This position, open to graduate students, offers students an
opportunity to actively engage with the PGD officers and planetary
community in an important role on this service committee.
Responsibilities include, but are not limited to, updating and
maintaining the Student Opportunities page on the PGD website, helping
to staff and provide student-related materials at the PGD booth during
the GSA annual meeting and at LPSC, running the annual button design
contest, serving as a PGD representative to the GSA Student Advisory
Council, and participating in and taking notes during regularly
scheduled PGD telecons. 

This is a two-year position (second year as a Senior Student Advisor),
and includes one partial travel award to attend and present
first-author research at the annual GSA meeting. To apply, email a
current one-page CV (include discipline and advisor) and a short
justification (300-500 words) on why you are interested in serving as
a PGD Student Advisor. Justification should focus on your record of
previous community involvement and public service. More details here: 

http://rock.geosociety.org/pgd/student-advisors.html

Send completed application materials as a single PDF to Sharon Wilson
Purdy at purdys@si.edu by June 1, 2018.

[NASA] ROSES-18 Amendment 13: C.23 ICEE 2 Final Text

The Instrument Concepts for Europa Exploration (ICEE) 2 program
supports the development of instruments and sample transfer
mechanism(s) for Europa surface exploration. The goal is to advance
both the technical readiness and spacecraft accommodation of
instruments and the sampling system for a potential future Europa
lander mission.

This opportunity is open to any instrument concept addressing one or
more of the Science Definition Team (SDT) objectives described in
"Europa Lander Study 2016 Report." While specific technology readiness
levels (TRL) are not prescribed for the ICEE 2 program, instrument
concepts must be at TRL 6 no later than the end of 2022.

The program is noteworthy in that all awardees will be required to
collaborate with the pre-project NASA-JPL spacecraft team and
potentially other awardees. This collaboration will provide the
opportunity for co-development of potential instruments, the sample
acquisition and delivery system, and the lander itself, as all of these
require maturation in a compatible system.

Step-1 proposals due: June 22, 2018
Step-2 proposals due: August 24, 2018

This amendment (NNH18ZDA001N) will be posted on the NASA research
opportunity homepage at
