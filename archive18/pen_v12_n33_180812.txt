POSTDOCTORAL POSITION IN EXPERIMENTAL PLANETARY SCIENCE

Columbia University's Astrophysics Laboratory invites applications for
a Postdoctoral Research Scientist to perform laboratory simulations of
solar wind ion irradiation of Mercury's regolith surface. The
successful candidate will join the group headed by Senior Research
Scientist Dr. Daniel Wolf Savin; they will participate in designing,
building, and performing experiments utilizing a novel ion beam
apparatus to study the spectral changes and sputtering yields of
regolith-like loose powders.

NASA POSTDOCTORAL FELLOWSHIP

Application deadline: November 1, 2018
 
The NASA Postdoctoral Program offers US and international scientists
the opportunity to advance their research while contributing to NASA's
scientific goals. The NPP supports fundamental science; explores the
undiscovered; promotes intellectual growth; and encourages scientific
connections.

Selected by a competitive peer-review process, NPP Fellows complete
one- to three-year Fellowship appointments that advance NASA's missions
in earth science, heliophysics, planetary science, astrophysics, space
bioscience, aeronautics and engineering, human exploration and space
operations, and astrobiology.

Current NPP research opportunities in planetary science can be viewed
here: NPP Planetary Science Research Opportunities

Applicants must have a Ph.D. or equivalent degree in hand before
beginning the fellowship, but may apply while completing the degree
requirements. U.S. citizens, Lawful Permanent Residents, and foreign
nationals eligible for J-1 status as a Research Scholar may apply.

UPDATED! Stipends now start at $60,000 per year, with supplements for
high cost-of-living areas and for certain academic specialties.
Financial assistance is available for relocation and health insurance,
and $10,000 per year is provided for professional travel.

A CATALOG OF MUSIC INSPIRED BY ASTRONOMY    
 
A new annotated guide (part of a series devoted to resources for
enjoying or teaching astronomy) features over 250 pieces of music
inspired by serious astronomy, including both classical and popular
music examples. YouTube links are given for the vast majority, so you
can listen to them. 
 
Among the pieces included is:
1) a Hubble Space Telescope cantata,
2) eight rock songs about black holes with reasonable science,
3) a supernova piano sonata,
4) a musical exploration of the Messier catalog of nebulae, clusters, and galaxies,
5) a moving song about Stephen Hawking,
6) Moon songs by the Grateful Dead, George Harrison, and the Police,
7) piano pieces "for children with small hands" named after the constellations,
8) operas about Galileo, Kepler, and Einstein, 
and many more (including planetary topics from Asteroids to Venus). 
 
You can access this guide directly by going to:

astronomy, is at:

DPS WOMEN IN PLANETARY SCIENCE DISCUSSION HOUR 2018 - KNOXVILLE, TN

Tuesday Oct 23, 12:00-1:30 pm (DPS Conference Venue, Room TBD)

Join us for the annual Women in Planetary Science event over lunch. All
are welcome! The main topic will be diversity and inclusion, and the
presentation/discussion schedule will be announced on the registration
page. Pre-registration is required to receive a lunch (available to the
first 100 registrants due the generosity of Aura and the Division for
Planetary Science), and registration is recommended even if you are
bringing your own lunch so we can balance room size with attendance
size. 

Registration deadline to receive a lunch is August 30th.

EARLY CAREER PARTICIPANT SUPPORT AVAILABLE FOR NASA OPAG MEETING

NASA's Outer Planets Assessment Group will provide travel grants for a
limited number of interested Early Career participants to attend the
OPAG meeting September 11-12 in Pasadena, CA. OPAG plays a key role in
sculpting the planetary science community's input into NASA activities
for outer planets science and exploration. Thus it is critical for
Early Career scientists to attend these meetings both to learn how NASA
and Planetary Science programs operate and to represent the community
that will work on OPAG-relevant projects in the coming decade. Selected
individuals will present a poster at the meeting on a topic of their
choosing. Interested graduate students, postdocs, and other Early
Career scientists (within 5 years of PhD/MS/BS) should submit a one
page letter of interest and a CV to britneys@eas.gatech.edu by August
20, 2018. Recipients will be notified by August 24. For more
information, email Britney Schmidt at the address above.

[NASA] ANNOUNCEMENT FOR PROPOSALS FOR A PARTNERSHIP AGREEMENT RELATED
TO SCIENCE ENGAGEMENT OPPORTUNITIES FOR THE NASA MARS 2020 PROJECT

The Mars 2020 rover mission is part of NASA's Mars Exploration Program,
a long-term effort of robotic exploration of the Red Planet. The Mars
2020 mission addresses high-priority science goals for Mars
exploration, including key questions about the potential for life on
Mars.
 
https://mars.nasa.gov/mars2020/

This AFP solicits proposals from commercial, educational, or non-profit
organizations to partner with NASA on a non-reimbursable, i.e.,
no-exchange-of-funds, basis to define, organize, and execute a contest
for K-12 students in U.S. schools to select a name for the Mars 2020
rover launching in 2020. NASA seeks proposals from organizations that
are innovative, inspirational, and utilize avenues of high impact for
reaching a diversity of populations and broadening participation. NASA
views such contests as opportunities that further the Agency objectives
to inform the public and distribute knowledge gained from the space
program to a broad audience.

Responses due: October 9, 2018

Details:

https://go.nasa.gov/2M7yLnk
 
Interested parties are encouraged to read the AFP carefully, as it
differs significantly from a ROSES-type solicitation.

GSA ANNUAL MEETING 2018 SESSION T149. VOLCANISM AND TECTONISM ON
PLANETARY BODIES

We invite contributions to a session on tectonic, volcanic, and
volcanotectonic processes on solar system bodies at the 2018 GSA Annual
Meeting in Indianapolis, IN, November 4-7.

Volcanism and tectonism are among the most ubiquitous processes at work
in the Solar System, substantially shaping the surfaces of worlds as
diverse as the terrestrial planets, icy satellites, and minor bodies.
Through a combination of solicited and contributed presentations, this
session will host observational, laboratory, theoretical, or analogue
fieldwork research into any aspect of planetary volcanic and tectonic
activity. We particularly welcome submissions that compare landforms
and processes on multiple bodies, including Earth, as well as how
lessons from specific studies can be applied more generally to
understanding volcanism and tectonism across this and even other solar
systems.

Please consider submitting an abstract for this session. For more
information, visit:

https://community.geosociety.org/gsa2018/science-careers/sessions/
abstracts

The submission deadline is August 14, 2018.

Conveners:
Paul Byrne (North Carolina State University)
Christian Klimczak (University of Georgia)

We look forward to seeing you in Indianapolis.

2ND ANNOUNCEMENT AND ADDITIONAL INFORMATION POSTED FOR 4TH LANDING SITE
WORKSHOP FOR THE MARS 2020 ROVER MISSION

The fourth and final landing site workshop for the Mars 2020 rover
mission will occur October 16-18, 2018 at the Hilton Los Angeles
North/Glendale in Glendale, CA. The workshop format will include oral
presentations and discussion related to the science potential of the
remaining candidate landing sites: Columbia Hills, Jezero Crater, and
NE Syrtis, including an additional landing ellipse within the NE Syrtis
region dubbed "Midway".

Presentations focusing on unique/new science content, increasing
confidence in the interpretations of the science potential of the
sites, and/or detailing potential extended mission targets are
encouraged. Instructions for submitting a presentation title to
workshop organizers (Matt Golombek and John Grant) are included in the
2nd announcement, which is posted at the workshop webpage. Information
regarding landing site engineering assessments, the development of the
Midway ellipse, and information on hotel block/registration are also
posted to the workshop webpage.
