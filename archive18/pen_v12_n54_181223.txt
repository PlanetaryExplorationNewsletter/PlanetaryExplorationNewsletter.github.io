ABSCICON 2019 SESSION: EXPLORING THE PLANETARY SYSTEM OF ALPHA CENTAURI

We invite you to submit an abstract to the 2019 Astrobiology Science
Conference, which will be held on 24-28 June 2019 in Bellevue,
Washington, to the session entitled "Exploring the planetary system of
Alpha Centauri: current knowledge, opportunities, and techniques". The
Alpha Centauri system (AB and Proxima) presents a unique opportunity
to detect and characterize a habitable planet in the next decade.

This session aims to survey the current knowledge about the system as
well as the opportunities, challenges, instruments, and instrument
concepts to detect and characterize the planetary systems of Alpha
Centauri, and determine the potential habitability of exoplanets
there. This includes studies of binary planet formation, dynamical
stability of planetary orbits in the system, limits from current
non-detections, as well as expected planet occurrence rates.
Techniques and instruments include indirect planet detection with
astrometric and RV measurements; direct imaging in optical bands as
well as thermal infrared, with current ground-based telescopes,
upcoming ELTs, as well as space telescope missions.

modern, Earth to Mars" is now receiving abstract submissions:

https://agu.confex.com/agu/abscicon19/prelim.cgi/Session/65841

Abstract on biosignatures production, preservation, alteration, or
detection, in sandy environments that are modern, ancient or
planetary, are welcome. Contributions related to biosignatures in
sandstones as potentially detectable by the Mars2020 rover payload

ABSCICON 2019 SESSION: ALIVE OR NOT?
 
"Alive or not? New strategies and techniques for recognizing 
biological signatures from the abiotic noise"

https://agu.confex.com/agu/abscicon19/prelim.cgi/Session/67151

Submission deadline: 23 January 2019 23:59 EST

We would like to invite colleagues to submit abstracts to our session
that concentrates on the search for life and the abiotic conditions
that may favor its evolution (habitability). Despite significant
scientific and technological progress in sampling and characterizing
extreme environments remotely and in situ, a significant obstacle in
our search for life beyond Earth is that we still lack a clear
understanding of how to recognize its presence beyond the terrestrial
evolution context, nor do we fully know how to disentangle its
signatures from the myriad of abiotic geochemical processes at play.

This session would address constraining the formation of biosignatures
across space and time, and would explore new strategies, techniques,
and instruments for recognizing them from abiotic environmental noise.
Contributions on experiments where abiotic and biotic factors are
considered, field studies in analogue environments and early Earth
deposits, as well as flight technologies/instruments for detecting
biosignatures from "life as we know it" as well as "life as we don't
know it" are welcome to this session.
 
See you in Seattle!

ABSCICON 2019 SESSION: HAVE COMET, WILL TRAVEL!

We are pleased to announce that AbSciCon 2019 (June 24-28, 2019,
Bellevue, WA) will feature a session focused on the role small bodies
play in promoting habitability.

https://agu.confex.com/agu/abscicon19/prelim.cgi/Session/66054

Topic Area: Star-planet-planetary system interactions and habitability
Session Title: Have Comet, Will Travel - How small bodies promote
habitable conditions across the solar system? 
Session ID: 66054
Submission deadline: 23 January 2019 23:59 EST

Small bodies in the solar system (and other planetary systems) may
play a significant role in the promotion, proliferation, dissemination
and the cessation of life and its related building blocks.

This session will combine recent insights from experimental,
observational and theoretical studies of ice and organic-rich
environments of comets and carbonaceous asteroids. We invite
contributions aimed at revealing how the physics and chemistry of
small bodies help catalyze and distribute life's building blocks,
across the planetary system, from early to late stages of planetary
formation.

For more details and abstract submission go to:

https://agu.confex.com/agu/abscicon19/prelim.cgi/Session/66054

Please feel free to forward this email to your colleagues who might be
interested in this session.

EGU 2019 SESSION: PLANETARY SPACE WEATHER

PS4.1 "Planetary Space Weather: Fundamental plasma interactions in 
space environments"

Convener: Zhonghua Yao 
Co-conveners: Philippe Garnier, Valeria Mangano 
 
The emphasis of the session is on crucial processes of planetary space
weather, that is, plasma physics and interactions of the
interplanetary medium with the Solar System bodies, including:
(a) magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling dynamics and auroras: from the 
    Earth to other planets
(b) the solar wind interaction with planets, moons, asteroids and 
    comets
(c) plasma interactions with exospheres, dust and surfaces
(d) surface space weathering
(e) potential impact of planetary environment on technological space 
    systems
(f) inter-comparisons of planetary environments

Contributions are welcome that address previous, present, forthcoming
and planned observations from space. Analyses of ground-based
observations of neutral and ionized environments and laboratory
studies simulating the interactions on planetary analogues are
welcome. Theoretical modeling and simulations are also strongly
encouraged, both in themselves and as a basis for inter-comparisons
and interpretation of measurements. Major breakthroughs on terrestrial
space weather have been made with measurements from THEMIS, Cluster,
AMPERE, MMS and Van Allen Probes, so we welcome relevant terrestrial
topics as comparative study has proven to be a powerful tool in
understanding planetary space weather.

EGU 2019 SESSION: Earth Analogs for Planetary Exploration

BG7.1 "Earth Analogs for Planetary Exploration: Field, Lab and
Simulations"

Dear colleagues,

Please consider submitting an abstract to our EGU 2019 session. A lot
of great field, laboratory and simulations studies will be featured!

More information is available at: 

https://meetingorganizer.copernicus.org/EGU2019/session/32087

Abstract deadline: January 10th 2019, 13h CET.

Terrestrial analog studies provide invaluable insights into geological
and biological processes that may have occurred on other planets. The
understanding and knowledge of terrestrial analog sites is key to the
interpretation of data acquired remotely on other planets, but also to
the preparation, testing and optimization of future missions.
Conditions representative of other, rather inaccessible,
extra-terrestrial environments can be investigated on Earth or through
laboratory and numerical experiments. Authors are in particular
encouraged to submit contributions on:
- Field and remote sensing studies on Earth and other planets
- Field testing of future exploration missions
- Laboratory experiments in planetary conditions 
- Numerical simulations in planetary conditions

We look forward to your contributions and to seeing you in Vienna.
Happy holidays!

The conveners: Jessica Flahaut, Janice Bishop, Barbara Cavalazzi,
Monica Pondrelli, Angelo Pio Rossi

PS2.2 "Exploring the primordial Solar System: First Results from
Hayabusa 2 and Osiris Rex"

Dear Colleagues,

We would like to invite you to attend our session at the next EGU
General Assembly 2019, Vienna, Austria, 7 - 12 April 2019.

To present your research at this session, please submit your abstract
at:

https://meetingorganizer.copernicus.org/EGU2019/session/31972

Abstract deadline: 10 January 2019, 13:00 CET

JAXA and NASA space missions Hayabusa 2 and Osiris-Rex have the
ambitious objective to orbit around two primitive carbonaceous Near
Earth Asteroids (162173 Ryugu and 101955 Bennu) to understand the
origin and evolution of the Solar System. The two missions will
collect samples of the two bodies and return back them to the Earth
for further and more accurate analysis in laboratory. This session is
open to all the scientists directly involved in the two missions to
show the first results obtained so far, and to discuss possible links
between the two objects. Nevertheless, we invite all other scientists
to present their scientific discussions, modelling, laboratory
simulations about these two primitive NEAs.

GEMINI 2019 LARGE AND LONG PROGRAMS CALL FOR PROPOSALS RELEASED

Gemini Observatory announces the opportunity for new Large and Long
Programs, with observations beginning in the 2019B semester. Letters
of Intent to propose a new Large and Long Program are due February 4,
2019. Completed Proposals are due April 1, 2019. See the current Call
for Proposals for further information:

http://www.gemini.edu/sciops/observing-gemini/proposal-routes-and-
observing-modes/large-and-long-programs/2019-llp-call

Large and long programs (hereafter "large programs" or LLPs) are
Principal Investigator defined and driven programs that, as a
guideline, either require significantly more time than a partner
typically approves for a single program or extend over two to six
semesters, or both. Large programs are expected to promote
collaborations across the partnership's communities, to have
significant scientific impact, and normally to provide a homogeneous
data set, potentially for more general use. Proposals for Large and
Long programs are accepted annually.
