AGU SESSION EP031: PLANETS AS EXPERIMENTS - SURFACE PROCESSES IN
EXTRATERRESTRIAL ENVIRONMENTS

This session is cross-listed and co-organized with Planetary Sciences.

Session description: Quantitative models for surface processes have 
been derived for Earth systems. When applied to other planetary 
bodies, these Earth-based models can provide critical insights into 
the geologic history of the Solar System. In return, planetary 
surfaces across the Solar System offer a unique opportunity to test 
these models under conditions often unachievable on Earth. We invite 
a range of contributions in the field of planetary surface processes 
with an emphasis on fluid and granular flows (fluvial, eolian, glacial, 
mass wasting, coastal, etc.) and that use planetary analogs, 
laboratory experiments, theoretical and numerical modeling, and 
planetary-exploration data from orbiters, landers, and rovers. This 
session's goal is to explore the interplay between quantitative models 
for planetary surface processes and new planetary exploration data that 
often challenge these models. We intend this session to foster more 
collaboration between members of the PS and EPSP sections. Go to:

AGU SESSION P004: BALLOONS IN EARTH AND PLANETARY SCIENCES - RESEARCH, 
APPLICATIONS, AND EMERGING CONCEPTS

Scientific balloons have greatly expanded our capabilities to 
investigate geophysical phenomena on the Earth and beyond. In Earth 
science, they can fill the gap between Earth and space-based 
observations, offer large coverage areas, and enable an aerial 
perspective at a fraction of the cost of a satellite mission. In 
planetary exploration, they offer opportunities for remote sensing of 
atmospheric and surface process from a close range. Programs such as 
the NASA High Altitude Student Platform have also been instrumental in 
increasing student involvement in the sciences. This session will be 
dedicated to discussing current and planned scientific ballooning 
initiatives in the Earth, atmospheric, and planetary sciences. We 
invite presentations on balloon platforms experiments. Topics can 
include but are not limited to research from atmospheric sciences 
(including atmospheric chemistry), geomagnetism, planetary sciences, 
and seismology. Presentations may report results from past experiments, 
conceptual design, or future experiments. Go to:

AGU SESSION P020: FROM THE EARTH TO THE MOONS - UNRAVELING THE
GEOLOGIC, OCEANOGRAPHIC AND CHEMICAL MYSTERIES OF ICE AND OCEAN WORLDS

Cross-listed with planetary, cryosphere, and ocean sciences, we want to 
bring together studies of ice and ocean worlds: those in our own solar 
system (including Earth!), possible analogues in extra-solar systems, 
and the associated geological, geochemical and oceanographic processes 
that might contribute to the evolution (habitability included) of ices, 
oceans and their interactions. Seeking to bridge Earth and planetary 
studies from Mercury to Pluto and all satellites in between, we 
encourage contributions on: in-situ/remote sensing observations; 
theoretical and laboratory work; analog field work investigations. 
Go to:

https://agu.confex.com/agu/fm18/prelim.cgi/Session/45706

We hope to see you in Washington, D.C. this December, discoveries 
abound! It will be fun!

AGU SESSION P028: OBSERVATIONS OF PLANETS NEAR AND FAR WITH 
NEXT-GENERATION TELESCOPES

We invite abstracts focused on understanding how future large 
observatories can drive new discoveries and enable powerful comparative 
planetology on planets, moons, and small bodies within the solar system 
and beyond in this AGU session.

Session Description: Future observatories can enable groundbreaking 
planetary science in the solar system and beyond. Large-aperture 
telescopes may obtain flyby or orbiter-quality imaging and 
spectroscopic data from many solar system objects. This would allow for 
monitoring of, e.g. possible geyser activity on icy moons or storms on 
the giant planets. Beyond the solar system, these same future large 
observatories could discover and characterize many nearby exoplanets, 
some of which may be habitable and could be examined for signs of life. 
The worlds of our solar system guide our understanding of other planets 
elsewhere as nearby data-rich targets, while exoplanets help place 
Earth and our solar system into a broader context.

AGU SESSION P036: REGOLITH DEVELOPMENT ON ICY AND ROCKY SURFACES

Session Description: The surfaces of airless worlds such as the Moon 
and icy satellites are covered with impact-generated regolith layers. 
In the absence of an atmosphere, processes such as impact gardening, 
sputtering, thermal segregation, mass wasting, sintering, and other 
processes will alter the ice or rock material, acting together over 
the age of the surface (tens to hundreds of millions of years for icy 
satellites, up to billions of years for rocky surfaces such as the 
Moon). This session will focus on the development of regoliths on both 
icy and rocky surfaces. Understanding regolith properties is 
essential to consider surface-subsurface transport rates, surface 
modification / preservation timescales, and physical properties 
relevant to future spacecraft landing (such as strength and porosity). 
Abstracts that consider observational, theoretical, and laboratory 
investigations of regolith are encouraged, particularly those that 
compare and contrast regolith development on icy vs. rocky surfaces.

AGU SESSION P047: THE EFFECTS OF IMPACT CRATERING IN MAFIC ROCKS AND 
MINERALS

This session covers recent and ongoing work focused on impact cratering 
and shock effects in mafic rocks and minerals (including but not 
limited to olivine, pyroxene, and plagioclase). We seek contributions 
that involve field, laboratory, and remote studies of terrestrial, 
extraterrestrial, or experimental cratering.

The abstract submission form is currently open and will close on 
Wednesday, August 1, 2018. The session is currently listed as an 
"eLightning session" but will be given poster/oral sessions if there 
are enough submissions. We encourage you and your students to consider 
this session. Go to:

AGU SESSION P053: THE URANUS AND NEPTUNE SYSTEMS, AND THEIR RELATION TO
OTHER PLANETS

This session encompasses all aspects of ice-giant systems: The 
magnetospheres, satellites, rings, atmospheres, and interiors of Uranus 
and Neptune; their formation and evolution; and their relation to other 
planets in and beyond our solar system. Exploring Uranus and Neptune 
will reveal how they form, how their magnetic fields are generated, how 
their magnetospheres interact with the solar wind, the energy balance 
of their atmospheres, and the nature of their rings and satellites, 
particularly those seen to be active (Triton) or with young surfaces 
(Miranda, Ariel). Radial migration of the ice giants may have shaped 
the solar system as we know today. Looking beyond, the Kepler mission 
has shown that ice giants are common in our galaxy: most planets known 
today are thought to be ice giants. Observations, modeling, and theory 
related to the ice giants will inform the design of missions to Uranus 
and Neptune which are currently under consideration. Go to:

AGU SESSION SM007: MAGNETOSPHERES IN THE INNER SOLAR SYSTEM

Session description: The structure and dynamics of each planetary 
magnetosphere (intrinsic and induced) in the inner solar system are 
driven by a unique set of factors including the nature of its 
magnetization, atmosphere-ionosphere coupling, and local solar wind 
parameters. To provide a forum for discussion of recent data analysis 
and modeling efforts concerning the inner planet magnetospheres, this 
session welcomes submissions on the intrinsic magnetospheres of Mercury 
and Earth, as well as the induced magnetospheres of Venus and Mars. It 
will focus on general magnetospheric processes including, but not 
limited to: solar wind-magnetosphere interactions, 
magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling, plasma acceleration and transport, 
magnetic reconnection, wave instabilities, magnetotail dynamics, and 
bow shock physics. We strongly encourage comparative studies of these 
inner solar system magnetospheres with each other or with other 
planetary magnetospheres throughout the solar system. Go to:
