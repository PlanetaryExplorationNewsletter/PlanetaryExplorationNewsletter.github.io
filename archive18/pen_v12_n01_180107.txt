Abstract submission deadline: January 19, 2018

You are cordially invited to participate in the AOGS-2018 meeting and
submit your abstracts to Session PS08 "Polarization as a Tool for
Exploration of Earth, Solar System and Beyond."

Polarimetry is a powerful observing tool and modeling technique,
providing information about astronomical objects that cannot be
obtained by traditional photometric/spectroscopic observations.
Applications range from characterization of solar system objects (Sun,
Earth, planetary atmospheres, aurorae, comets, asteroids, planetary
satellites/ring systems, dust, etc.) to the detection of exoplanets and
identification of biological markers in search of habitability. This
session is open to papers about observations of solar system bodies,
protoplanetary disks, exoplanets, theoretical or experimental
investigations, instrument developments for ground-based facilities or
future space missions.

Conveners: Padma A.Yanamandra-Fisher (US), Ludmilla Kolokolova (US),
Lucyna Chudczer (Australia), Shashikiran Ganesh (India), Svetlana

AOGS SESSION PS-14: PLANETARY DATA IN THE BIG DATA ERA
 
Asia Oceania Geosciences Conference 2018
June 3 - 8, Honolulu, Hawaii
Abstract submission deadline: January 19, 2018

Conference website:

http://www.asiaoceania.org/aogs2018/public.asp?page=home.htm
 
This session is about all aspects related to planetary science data,
including, but not limited to, data collection, cataloging, archiving,
sharing, searching, manipulation, mining, and the related software
tools. We welcome abstracts on any data-related topics. A tremendous
amount of data is being generated every day in planetary science
researches. Data technologies are playing more and more important roles
in planetary researches, especially in the big data era. Archiving and
public release of all data from planetary science exploration missions
as well as ground-based observing and laboratory facilities have been
recognized to be of great importance and broad community interest. Data
archives provide long-term preservation of a broad variety of raw and
high-level data products, with the ultimate goal of facilitating
analyses using data covering long time-baselines and multiple
observations for the new phenomena and scientific objectives emerging
in future times. The collection, archiving, and public release of
ever-growing amount of planetary data will ultimately enable the
applications of big data technologies in planetary science research.
This session is a forum to discuss the new developments in activities,
technologies, and concepts related to planetary science data.

AOGS SESSION PS-19: ROSETTA, COMETS, AND OTHER ICY BODIES

Asia Oceania Geosciences Conference 2018
June 3 - 8, Honolulu, Hawaii
Abstract submission deadline: January 19, 2018
Conference website:

http://www.asiaoceania.org/aogs2018/public.asp?page=home.htm

In this session we aim to understand the formation, evolution and
diversity of icy bodies large and small and place them into context
with the rest of the solar system. These distant, cold worlds are slow
in divulging their secrets. Space missions flying past and orbiting the
giant planets have revealed a diverse icy satellite system, with some
clearly showing activity. The ROSETTA mission revealed many of the
secrets of comet 67P/C-G, and more icy active bodies are regularly
found inside of Jupiter's orbit. In recent years, ground-based
observations have also made rapid progress in detecting water-related
features. It is an exciting time to synthesize what we have learnt so
far, highlight key points of agreement and contention, and to provide
recommendations for future studies. We aim to integrate views and data
from space missions, thermal and internal modeling, dynamics and
observations to formulate a coherent picture of the state of icy bodies
in the solar system and what they can tell us about the formation and
evolution our own world.

EGU SESSION: ACCRETION, DIFFERENTIATION AND VOLATILES - CONSTRAINTS ON
TERRESTRIAL PLANETS

Please consider contributing to session GMPV2.7/PS1.12 at EGU.

Deadline: 10 January 2018

Submission URL:

https://www.egu2018.eu

Convenors: Helene Bureau, Mohamed Ali Bouhifd, Ramon Brasser, George
Helffrich, Vincenzo Stagno

This session aims to provide a multidisciplinary view on the earliest
stage of the formation, dynamics and chemistry of the Earth and inner
planets, and on the modern volatile cycling in the deep Earth.
Session description: The early evolution of the Solar System witnessed
the emergence of planetesimals, followed by the assembly of
differentiated protoplanets and eventually the coalescence into the
embryonic terrestrial planets. Much remains unclear of the nature of
this primordial accretion and evolution. More especially, about the
significant role played by volatile elements (H, C, N, S, halogens) that
are significant ingredients necessary for the habitability of planets.
The storage and cycling of volatiles in Earth and other planetary bodies
depend on the structure and stability of volatile-bearing minerals and
fluid/melts at high pressure and temperature either at mantle or core
conditions. The origin and behaviour of volatiles during Earth's
accretion and its differentiation is determinant but still not well
constrained.

COSPAR 2018: ICE GIANT SYSTEMS

Abstracts due Feb 9, 2018

Commission B, Event B5.4:  

https://www.cospar-assembly.org/admin/session_cospar.php?session=810   

With the culmination of the unprecedented simultaneous exploration of
two gas giant planets by Juno and Cassini, the time has come for the
first comprehensive exploration at the next frontier of our Solar
System:  the ice giants, Uranus and Neptune. These tantalising
destinations provide extreme atmospheric configurations (one powered by
internal heat, the other experiencing the strangest seasons in the
Solar System), magnetospheres unlike any other worlds, fine-scale and
delicate rings, and a plethora of icy satellites that might be expected
to be just as rich as those found orbiting the giant planets. Recent
orbital, flyby, and probe mission concepts and ground- and space-based
observations have helped to reignite scientific interest in the
international community.

We invite presentations discussing new insights and future
observational and mission requirements for the Solar System ice giant
planets. We welcome presentations on ice giant topics including
observational and theoretical studies of planetary origins and
interiors; atmospheric dynamics and meteorology; chemistry and
composition; magnetospheres and auroras; and wider ice giant system
science (icy satellites and rings). Presentations on future mission
concepts for these distant worlds are also encouraged.

COSPAR 2018: MARS SCIENCE RESULTS
 
Dear Colleague,
 
We invite you to submit an abstract to the COPSAR - Mars Science
Results session (B4.1), due Feb. 9, 2018. COSPAR will be held July
14-22, 2018 in Pasadena, CA. Mars has been extensively studied using
spacecraft data, theoretical modeling, laboratory studies, and
comparative planetology over the last several decades. As of this
time, there are six operating orbiters (ODY, MEx, MRO, MAVEN, MOM, and
TGO) and two operating rovers (Opportunity and Curiosity) exploring
Mars' atmosphere, surface, and subsurface to understand the planet's
history and habitability. The InSight spacecraft, designed to probe
the deep interior of Mars, is planned to land in late 2018. This
session will address new science resulting from these missions, as well
as studies reliant on theory, modeling, laboratory studies, and
comparative planetology. For more information and for complete
descriptions and abstract submission instructions see the Assembly web
