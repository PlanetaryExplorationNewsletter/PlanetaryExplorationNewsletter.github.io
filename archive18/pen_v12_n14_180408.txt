2ND INTERNATIONAL MARS SAMPLE RETURN CONFERENCE 

25-27 April 2018, AXICA Berlin, Germany

Registration Deadline Wednesday 11 April

The purpose of the 2nd International MSR Conference is to establish a
better understanding of the options for a possible International Mars
Sample Return campaign in the next decade, given the 2018 context, to
highlight recent accomplishments in Mars exploration that feed forward
to Mars Sample Return, and to share international agency and private
industry preparatory plans for future Mars missions relating to Mars
Sample Return.

Registration closes on 11 April 2018. If you plan to attend and have
not yet registered, please register here:

NASA POSTDOCTORAL FELLOWSHIP APPLICATION DEADLINE JULY 1, 2018
 
The NASA Postdoctoral Program offers US and international scientists
the opportunity to advance their research while contributing to NASA's
scientific goals. The NPP supports fundamental science; explores the
undiscovered; promotes intellectual growth; and encourages scientific
connections.

Selected by a competitive peer-review process, NPP Fellows complete
one- to three-year Fellowship appointments that advance NASA's missions
in earth science, heliophysics, planetary science, astrophysics, space
bioscience, aeronautics and engineering, human exploration and space
operations, and astrobiology.

Current NPP research opportunities in planetary science can be viewed
here: 

https://npp.usra.edu/opportunities/?filter_keywords=&filter_fields=145

Applicants must have a Ph.D. or equivalent degree in hand before
beginning the fellowship, but may apply while completing the degree
requirements. U.S. citizens, Lawful Permanent Residents, and foreign
nationals eligible for J-1 status as a Research Scholar may apply.

UPDATED! Stipends now start at $60,000 per year, with supplements for
high cost-of-living areas and for certain academic specialties.
Financial assistance is available for relocation and health insurance,
and $10,000 per year is provided for professional travel.

Applications are accepted three times each year: March 1, July 1, and
November 1.

[NASA] SPACETECH-REDDI-2018 APPENDIX F1: TECH FLIGHTS - NASA FLIGHT
OPPORTUNITIES NOW OPEN

NASA has released a solicitation, titled NASA Flight Opportunities
(FO): Technology Advancement Utilizing Suborbital Flight
Opportunities.

Applications are due on or before June 8, 2018, and selections will be
announced in November 2018 (target). The solicitation is available by
opening the NASA Research Opportunities homepage at:

http://nspires.nasaprs.com

or directly at:

https://tinyurl.com/NASA-18FO-F1

The Flight Opportunities program will conduct two Q&A sessions to
provide an overview of the solicitation and to answer questions about
the proposal process. See NSPIRES for more details.

Flight Opportunities strategically invests in the growth of the
commercial spaceflight market while helping advance technologies that
will enable future space missions for science and exploration. The
program achieves these self-reinforcing objectives by selecting
promising technologies from industry, academia, and government to test
on commercial suborbital launch vehicles, reduced gravity aircraft and
high-altitude balloon flights. Investment in tests that take
technologies from the laboratory to a relevant flight environment
facilitates technology maturation, validates feasibility and reduces
technical risks. These investments enable infusion of key space
technologies into multiple future space missions.

PROGRAM FOR THE CARBON IN THE SOLAR SYSTEM WORKSHOP

https://carbon-workshop.arc.nasa.gov

April 25-27, 2018

Please join us to discuss the signatures of carbonaceous compounds
throughout the solar system in the first of two workshops sponsored by
NASA's Solar System Exploration Research Virtual Institute (SSERVI)
about Carbon in the Solar System. This is a workshop without walls, so
participants will listen to presentations and participate in
discussions remotely (telephone and video conferencing).

Some of the topics to be discussed are:

Where do we/don't we find carbon and why?

What techniques are used to observe it?

How does meteoritic carbon relate to the history of the solar system?

What can we learn about relationships between carbon in the
interstellar medium (ISM) and dense molecular clouds, where planetary
systems form in protoplanetary disks, and the carbon we see today in
our own solar system?

How do carbon compounds evolve with weathering/processing?

Hope to see/hear you there! (please check the website for connection
information)
