SUMMER INTERNSHIPS AT JOHNS HOPKINS APPLIED PHYSICS LAB (APL)
 
The Space Exploration Sector of The Johns Hopkins University Applied
Physics Laboratory (APL) in Laurel, MD is now accepting applications
for the APL NASA Intern Program. Rising sophomores through Ph.D.
students as of fall 2018 who are selected will contribute to
NASA-related missions and research work. Talks by key mission engineers
and scientists, along with tours of APL and other activities, will be
provided. Applicants must be U.S. citizens, be in high academic
standing (3.0 GPA or higher), and have successfully passed a background
check. Applications are due by March 30, 2018; however, selections are
made on a continuous basis, so interested students should apply as
early as possible. For more information, please visit:

PLUTO AFTER NEW HORIZONS: DATE CHANGE
 
The dates for the international science conference on the Pluto system
and the Kuiper Belt have been moved to July 12-16, 2019 (Friday-
Tuesday). Unfortunately, these new dates span a weekend, but that was
unavoidable owing to conflicts with two other major conferences.

There will be a reception commemorating the 4th anniversary of the
Pluto flyby during the evening of July 14th. The venue remains the
same: The Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory in
Laurel, MD.

This conference will provide an opportunity to summarize our
understanding of the Pluto system and the Kuiper belt following the New
Horizons encounters with Pluto and 2014 MU69. Contributions spanning
all relevant research on the Kuiper belt (observations and theory) will
be solicited. The conference will also serve as a nucleus for a
forthcoming volume "Pluto After New Horizons" in the University of
Arizona Space Science Series (projected 2020 publication date), the
successor to "Pluto-Charon" published in 1997.

A detailed registration website will be set up this summer,
~1 year prior to the conference.

With best regards,

TOPICAL ISSUE OF JOURNAL OF SPACE WEATHER AND SPACE CLIMATE

The Journal of Space Weather and Space Climate (SWSC) plans a Topical
Issue on "Planetary Space Weather" to appear in 2018. Space weather -
the monitoring and prediction of disturbances in our near-space
environment and how they are controlled by the Sun - is since long
recognised as an important aspect of understanding our Earth and
protecting vital assets such as orbiting satellites and power grids.
The concepts of space weather and space situational awareness have also
been extended to other planets in our Solar System and in particular to
spacecraft that voyage through it.

This Issue aims to detail available methods and tools developed in
order to make services for planetary space weather and space
situational awareness operational. Papers on the validation of the
services, availability of data relevant to the field, as well as
research on forecast and modelling of the planetary environments and
their response to solar or meteor disturbances are welcome.

Deadline for article submission is 15 April 2018.

AOGS SESSION PS02: VOLCANISM AND TECTONISM ACROSS THE SOLAR SYSTEM

Asia Oceania Geosciences Conference 2018
June 3-8, Honolulu, Hawaii 
Abstract submission deadline: 19 January 2018

http://www.asiaoceania.org/aogs2018/public.asp?page=home.htm 

The surfaces of the terrestrial planets and their satellites have been
largely shaped through volcanic and tectonic processes. Extreme
conditions on outer solar system bodies, such as the Jovian and
Saturnian satellites, result in different types of volcanism and
tectonism. Fracturing and faulting processes mainly affect minor bodies
such as asteroids and small moons, where volcanism and tectonism have
not played an important role. We invite contributions that cover a wide
range of topics including geomorphology and composition of volcanic
deposits, edifices, and plumes, volcano-induced deformation and edifice
growth and collapse to tectonic structures, faulting and fracturing
processes, crustal stress and strain analysis, cryovolcanism, and any
study related to planetary endogenic processes. Furthermore, studies
that relay interactions between planetary interiors, surfaces, and
atmospheres are welcomed. Comparative studies of volcanic or tectonic
systems on Earth with a strong remote sensing component are encouraged.

Hope to see you there!

AOGS SESSION PS22: FIELD AND LABORATORY STUDIES IN SUPPORT OF PLANETARY
INFRARED REMOTE SENSING

Asia Oceania Geosciences Conference 2018
June 3-8, Honolulu, Hawaii 
Abstract submission deadline: 19 January 2018

http://www.asiaoceania.org/aogs2018/public.asp?page=home.htm 

Dear colleagues,

Weâ€™d like to draw your attention to a session focused on field and
laboratory studies at the 2018 AOGS meeting.

This session will highlight the importance of comprehensive analog
studies towards understanding planetary remote sensing datasets, with a
focus on the near infrared and thermal infrared. Contributions that
probe the links between the small-scale of laboratory (microns to
millimeters) and ground/airborne field (centimeters to meters)
measurement to the large-scale (10s meters to kilometers) in remote
sensing observations to better interpret the dynamics, chemistry,
composition, thermophysics, and physical properties of surfaces and
atmospheres are encouraged. This session is open to a diverse range of
planetary bodies, including Mercury, Venus, Moon, NEOs, Mars, Martian
Moons, MBOs, Trojans, Gas Giants, Ice Giants, Icy Satellites, Irregular
Satellites, and Plutoids. New developments of instrumentation and
techniques used in field and laboratory studies are also welcome.

Look forward to seeing you in Honolulu!

COSPAR 2018: OCEAN WORLDS: EUROPA, ENCELADUS, TITAN, AND BEYOND

14-22 July 2018
Pasadena, California

Solar system exploration stands on the edge of profound discovery,
offering the opportunity to search for habitable environments and
possible signs of life in one or more of the ocean worlds of the outer
solar system in the coming decades. This event welcomes papers
describing one or more of the confirmed or potential ocean worlds that
harbor subsurface oceans of liquid water and/or, for Saturn's moon
Titan, surface reservoirs of liquid hydrocarbon and solid organics.
These bodies represent attractive targets for future stand-alone and
cooperative missions by the major space agencies in the quest to
understand the potential for life in the solar system.

Submissions that describe new observations of ocean properties,
stimulate or describe future observations, review our current state of
knowledge, laboratory investigations, or future missions plans are
encouraged.

Abstracts for contributed presentations at Session B5.3 are due on
February 9, 2018, and must be submitted on the COSPAR website. Full
details for abstract submission, as well as the detailed description of
the content of the session are available at:

https://www.cospar-assembly.org

COSPAR 2018: SMALL BODY HAZARD

14-22 July 2018
Pasadena, California

We invite you to submit an abstract to session COSPAR-18-S.3, due Feb.
9, 2018. Planetary defense against small body impacts is an active
field of research, which involves ground-based observational
activities, numerical modeling of deflection techniques, experiments to
validate models in the laboratory, and space mission projects and
associated technology developments. The asteroid impact hazard is the
only natural hazard that can be predicted and prevented with feasible
means. The small body hazard is inherently an international issue. The
AIDA mission project, a joint collaboration between ESA and NASA, is
the first demonstration and test of asteroid deflection using a kinetic
impactor and an orbiter spacecraft. This work has triggered important
activities related to planetary defense. Work currently focused on the
definition and coordination of technology needs and requirements for
planetary defence, modelling and simulations of impact outcomes
including benchmarking of available tools, definition of remote sensing
observations, characterization payloads and close-proximity operations.
This special event will discuss the various elements and their current
state. For more information and for complete descriptions and abstract
submission instructions see the Assembly web page:

COSPAR 2018: OBSERVATIONS OF PLANETARY OBJECTS WITH NON-PLANETARY 
SPACECRAFT

14-22 July 2018
Pasadena, California

Missions not primarily designed for planetary observations are
nevertheless valuable sources of observational data on major, dwarf,
and minor planets, as well as comets. Example missions are the NASA/ESA
SOHO and NASA STEREO solar and heliospheric missions, that have
returned observations of numerous comets, the NASA Kepler exoplanet
mission which has observed planets and various small bodies, and ESA's
Gaia mapping mission. In this session, we address such observations
carried out by past and current missions as well as projects that are
in development and proposed. Contributions are invited to provide an
overview of results from such observations, and those planned for the
future. Contributions that provide insights into the securing of
serendipitous planetary observations to help advise future efforts are
particularly encouraged.

Abstracts for contributed presentations at Session B0.3 are due on
February 9, 2018, and must be submitted on the COSPAR website-full
details for abstract submission, as well as the detailed description of
the content of the session are available at
