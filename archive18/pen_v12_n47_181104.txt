GRADUATE STUDENT RESEARCH OPPORTUNITIES IN PLANETARY SCIENCE AT YORK 
UNIVERSITY, TORONTO

The Earth and Space Science and Engineering Department at York 
University welcomes graduate student applications related to planetary 
sciences with a focus on active atmospheric and surface processes on 
Mars and on ices throughout the solar system. Students entering the 
program will focus on how various ices affect the surface and 
atmosphere/climate of a planetary body. Opportunities for data 
analysis, laboratory experiments, and computer simulations are 
available.

ESSE has state of the art laboratory facilities, including two 
pressure chambers, in which to perform experiments in relevant 
conditions.

Canadian citizenship is not required. Please contact Isaac Smith: 
ibsmith@yorku.ca for more details.

EGU 2019 PS1.8/AS4.58: ATMOSPHERES AND EXOSPHERES OF TERRESTRIAL 
PLANETS, SATELLITES, AND EXOPLANETS

The abstract submission is open for EGU2019, held in Vienna on 7-12 
April, 2019.

The deadline for the abstract submission is 10 January 2019, 13:00 CET 
or, for those applying for EGU Roland Schlich travel support, 
1 December 2018, 13:00 CET.

I would like to draw your attention to our session: Atmospheres and 
exospheres of terrestrial planets, satellites, and exoplanets

This session primarily focuses on the neutral atmospheres of 
terrestrial bodies other than the Earth. This includes not only Venus 
and Mars, but also exoplanets with comparable envelopes and satellites 
carrying dense atmospheres such as Titan or exospheres such as 
Ganymede. We welcome contributions dealing with processes affecting the 
atmospheres of these bodies, from the surface to the exosphere. We 
invite abstracts concerning observations, both from Earth or from 
space, modeling and theoretical studies, or laboratory work. 
Comparative planetology abstracts will be particularly appreciated.

If you consider submitting an abstract in this session, you can use the 
following link:

/abstractsubmission/31969

Hope to see you in Vienna!

Best regards,

The conveners,

Francisco Gonzalez-Galindo, Arnaud Beth, Arianna Piccialli

THE NASA ROADMAP TO OCEAN WORLDS

We would like to bring to your attention the publication of a paper in 
Astrobiology, written by the OPAG Roadmaps to Ocean Worlds (ROW) team. 
This is a community-based assessment of science questions to be 
addressed, and priorities of, a NASA Ocean Worlds program:

EUROPEAN LUNAR SYMPOSIUM, EXPRESSION OF INTEREST

The 7th European Lunar Symposium (ELS) will be held in Manchester, UK, 
on 21-23 May 2019. The meeting, organised in partnership with NASA's 
Solar System Exploration Research Virtual Institute (SSERVI), will 
cover current advances and prospects in lunar science and exploration 
in Europe and elsewhere. 

Building upon successful previous ELS meetings and acknowledging a 
growing interest in lunar science exploration worldwide, we 
anticipate a larger number of participants for ELS 2019. In order to 
make necessary logistical arrangements, we would like your help in 
letting us know before the 5 December 2018 about your firm intention 
to attend ELS 2019.

Please register your interest on the ELS 2019 website main page:

AMAZONIAN MARS: CLIMAGE AND PROCESSES

Planetary and Space Science has approved a special issue on "Amazonian 
Mars: Climate and Processes," with submissions accepted November 1, 
2018 to February 28, 2019. Papers that describe the climate history as 
well as geological and environmental processes that pertain to the 
Amazonian period of Mars' history which includes the present-day are 
solicited. The Amazonian period encompasses the most recent 3 billion 
years of Mars history, which has strongly shaped the evolution of the 
surface that we observe today. This special issue was prompted by the 
recent Mars Workshop on Amazonian and Present-day Climate; submissions 
are welcome from the community and the lead guest editor is John Moores 
(York University). More information is available at:

[NASA] ROSES-18 AMENDMENT 36: D.7 K2 GO RETIRED FROM ROSES

ROSES-18 Amendment 36 removes from ROSES program element D.7 the K2 
Guest Observer (GO) Program.

Earlier this year ROSES program element D.7 K2 GO was solicited 
"contingent on the spacecraft health and fuel condition". Since the 
Kepler space telescope has run out of fuel needed for further science 
operations, this opportunity is being removed from ROSES. For more 
information see: 

https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/nasa-retires-kepler-space
-telescope-passes-planet-hunting-torch

Although the mission operations of Kepler/K2 have ceased, science using 
archival data will still be solicited in ROSES-2019, primarily via 
program element D.2 Astrophysics Data Analysis, but also via program 
elements E.3 the Exoplanets Research Program and D.4 the Astrophysics 
Theory Program.

The NASA point of contact for programmatic information is Mario Perez 
who may be reached at mario.perez@nasa.gov.

ENDORSEMENT OF EXPLANET AND ASTROBIOLOGY STRATEGIES

Please consider adding your name to the list of endorsers of the 
Exoplanet Science and Astrobiology Science Strategy reports, as input 
to the upcoming Astrophysics Decadal Survey. The science cross-cuts 
astrophysical and planetary realms.
