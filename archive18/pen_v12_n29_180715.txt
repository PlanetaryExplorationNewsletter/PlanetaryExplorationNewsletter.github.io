BRADFORD A. SMITH (1931-2018)

Brad Smith was a pioneer in the exploration of the solar system. He 
participated in a number of US and international space missions, 
including Mars Mariners 6 and 7, the Mars Viking mission, the Soviet 
Vega mission to Halley's Comet, the Soviet Phobos mission to Mars, and 
the Wide Field/Planetary Camera team for the Hubble Space Telescope. 
He was the deputy team leader of the imaging team on the Mariner 9 Mars 
Orbiter, and was chosen by NASA to lead the camera team on the Voyager 
missions to Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. He co-discovered a 
circumstellar disk around the nearby star, Beta Pictoris, the first 
direct evidence of a planetary system beyond our own, and continued 
these studies as a member of the infrared camera (NICMOS) experiment 
on the Hubble Space Telescope.

The memorial service for Brad will be held from 2 to 5 PM on Saturday, 
September 22, 2018 at the Lunar and Planetary Laboratory, Room 308, at 
the University of Arizona in Tucson. Please RSVP to Amy Phillips 
(amy_p@mac.com).

AGU SESSION P020: FROM THE EARTH TO THE MOONS - UNRAVELING THE 
GEOLOGIC, OCEANOGRAPHIC AND CHEMICAL MYSTERIES OF ICE AND OCEAN WORLDS

Cross-listed with planetary, cryosphere, and ocean sciences, we want to 
bring together studies of ice and ocean worlds: those in our own solar 
system (including Earth!), possible analogues in extra-solar systems, 
and the associated geological, geochemical and oceanographic processes 
that might contribute to the evolution (habitability included) of ices, 
oceans and their interactions. Seeking to bridge Earth and planetary 
studies from Mercury to Pluto and all satellites in between, we 
encourage contributions on: in-situ/remote sensing observations; 
theoretical and laboratory work; analog field work investigations.

We hope to see you in Washington, D.C. this December, discoveries 
abound! It will be fun!

AGU SESSION P050: THE ORIGIN, EVOLUTION AND FATE OF COMETS - NEW
RESULTS FROM ROSETTA, OTHER MISSIONS, AND GROUND-BASED OBSERVATIONS

Comets are among the primitive building blocks of the planets, but as 
they enter into the inner Solar System, they become dynamical bodies, 
almost transient in nature. Some comets have broken up completely 
(S/L-9 for example), while others have given up a little of themselves. 
The recent and up-close study of 67P/ Churyumov-Gerassimenko during its 
2015 perihelion passage has revealed in close detail the types of 
changes comets undergo as they are heated by the sun.

This session will cover the dynamical nature of the nucleus and coma 
of 67P/ and other comets. The session will also include comparisons 
between the results from Rosetta and other missions to understand how 
comets evolve through time. Broader topics such as the chemistry of 
comets and what that reveals about their origin and diversity are also 
welcome. Both spacecraft and ground-based observations are relevant to 
this session.

GSA SESSION T152: GRAIN TO GLOBAL PERSPECTIVES OF MARS - EVOLVING VIEWS
OF THE MARTIAN SEDIMENTARY ROCK RECORD

We solicit contributions to a session at this year's GSA Annual Meeting 
to take place November 4-7 in Indianapolis, Indiana. This session 
synthesizes recent research on the origin, deposition, and alteration 
of sediments on Mars. We seek contributions investigating the 
stratigraphy, chemistry, and mineralogy of Mars' sedimentary record 
using rover, orbital, and terrestrial analog data. We especially 
encourage new research on the martian sedimentary rock record using 
orbital datasets such as HiRISE/CTX/CRISM/OMEGA, rover observations 
from the MSL Curiosity and MER Opportunity rovers, and laboratory and 
terrestrial analog studies.

Abstract submission deadline: August 14, 2018

CORNELL UNIVERSITY - RESEARCH SUPPORT SPECIALIST II

The Cornell Center for Astrophysics and Planetary Science (CCAPS) is 
seeking candidates to fill a Research Support Specialist II position 
expected to be available this summer. The successful candidate is 
expected to support a three to four-year project to design, construct, 
install and commission a 40-beam cryogenically cooled phased array feed 
system operating at a frequency of 1.4 GHz (20 cm wavelength) intended 
for use on the 305 m Arecibo radio telescope in Puerto Rico. The 
responsibilities of the position along with qualifications required can 
be found at:

INPUT REQUESTED FOR SOLAR SYSTEM SCIENCE WITH ASTROPHYSICS ASSETS

A committee has been established to determine what the capabilities are 
for current/pending/future Astrophysics Assets. This effort follows a 
number of Solar System working groups that were organized for JWST and 
WFIRST (among others). Many lessons learned will carry over to other 
future missions, but requirements or desirements for all wavelengths 
should be considered in the era of the next large astrophysics mission 
(e.g. LUVOIR, OST, HabEX, LYNX, etc). 

Goal: to compile a uniform set of basic capabilities and needs to 
maximize the yield of Solar System science with future Astrophysics 
missions while allowing those missions to achieve their Astrophysics 
priorities.

Here we are seeking input from the community to be considered. All 
recommendations will be considered and compiled into a report for 
NASA's Planetary Science and Astrophysics Divisions to consider.

Please fill this form out by August 17:

[NASA] ROSES-18: DELAY OF DUE DATE, LATE DATA RELEASE, AND NEW 
OPPORTUNITY FOR CASSINI DATA ANALYSIS

This Amendment makes three announcements related to Cassini Data 
Analysis: First, it clarifies that the Planetary Data System's Cassini 
Data Release 54 posted release date was fewer than 30 days prior to 
the Step-2 due date and thus those data are not eligible for C.10 CDAP. 
Second, a new opportunity has been created in program element C.26 
for Cassini Data Release 54. Third, the due date for Step-2 proposals 
to C.10 has been delayed to August 14, 2018.

For C.26 Cassini Data Analysis Program: PDS Cassini Data Release 54 
Step-1 proposals are due by September 18, 2018 and Step-2 proposals are 
due December 7, 2018.  

The amended solicitations contain information on how funding will be 
handled in this situation, and it is not expected that the later due 
date of C.26 will delay the announcement of selections for C.10.

The MIT Department of Earth, Atmospheric, and Planetary Sciences 
invites qualified candidates to apply for a tenure-track faculty 
position. The search is in the broad area of geophysics and 
geochemistry encompassing the Earth and other planetary bodies in the 
solar system. We seek candidates who use theory, observation, and/or 
experimentation and particularly encourage applicants whose work 
crosses traditional disciplinary boundaries. Candidates should have 
the potential for innovation and leadership in research and a 
commitment to teaching at the undergraduate and graduate levels.

Applicants must hold a Ph.D. in geoscience or related field by the 
start of employment. Our intent is to hire at the assistant professor 
level, but more senior appointments may also be considered. A complete 
application must include a cover letter, curriculum vitae, one- to 
two-page descriptions each of research and teaching plans, and three 
letters of recommendations. We request that in their cover letter, 
applicants explicitly commit to our department's code of conduct:
