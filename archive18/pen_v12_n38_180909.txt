IN MEMORIAM: JOHN LONGHI (1946 - 2018)

We were saddened to learn that petrologist and long-time Lamont staff
member John Longhi passed away last week. John graduated with a BS in
Geology from Notre Dame in 1968 and entered the Peace Corps and served
in Kenya for more than two years. He earned his Ph.D. in 1976 from
Harvard University, where he worked in the lab of Jim Hays, along with
fellow students Dave Walker, Ed Stolper, Tim Grove, and others on
melting relations in basaltic systems and lunar basalts in particular.
After postdoctoral positions at MIT and the University of Oregon, John
spent eight years on the faculty at Yale University before moving to
Lamont in 1988, first as an Associate Research Scientist and later as
Doherty Senior Research Scientist and Lamont Research Professor.

IN MEMORIAM: ERIK HAURI (1966 - 2018)

Carnegie geochemist Erik Hauri, whose work upended our understanding of
the Moon's formation and the importance of water in Earth's interior,
died Wednesday in North Potomac, MD, following a battle with cancer. He
was 52. Over the last decade Hauri's work revealed that the Moon is not
"bone dry," as previously thought, but wet, and that its water
originated on Earth. These findings called into question longstanding
theories of the Moon's formation and researchers, including Hauri's
colleagues at Carnegie's Department of Terrestrial Magnetism, are still
working to reconcile a wet Moon with the prevailing lunar origin story.

A FREE WORKSHOP FOR EARLY-CAREER ASTRONOMERS WHO WANT TO DO BETTER
OUTREACH TO STUDENTS AND THE PUBLIC (REGISTER SOON)

January 5-6, 2019

The AAS Astronomy Ambassadors workshop will be held on the Saturday and
Sunday before the winter AAS meeting in Seattle, WA. Participants will
spend two days learning techniques, examining selected materials, and
getting to know each other and an existing community of astronomers
doing outreach. We especially want to encourage participation by
members of groups underrepresented in science.

Workshop costs are being underwritten by the AAS Board of Trustees, so
workshop registration, materials, and two days' lunches are free. If
necessary, we can also reimburse you for up to two nights' lodging if
attendance at the workshop requires you to travel to the meeting venue
early. (Participants are expected to be members of the AAS or to join,
and to register for the other parts of the AAS meeting. Note that
significantly reduced membership fees are available to students and to
educators.)

Applications are being accepted now and must be in no later than 5 
November 2018.

The Hawai'i Institute of Geophysics and Planetology (HIGP) at the
University of Hawai'i (UH) seeks to hire two tenure-track faculty
members (one appointment will be made at the assistant level, the other
at the associate level) to lead the development of small/micro/cube
satellite missions (or the development of key subsystems, such as
payloads) to support new Earth and planetary science missions.

For further details, including minimum/desirable qualifications and
application procedures, please see:

WIESS AND PAN POSTDOCTORAL FELLOWSHIPS AT RICE UNIVERSITY

The Department of Earth, Environmental and Planetary Sciences at Rice
University invites applications for the Wiess and the Pan Postdoctoral
Research Fellowships. We are seeking candidates with independent
research interests that intersect with one or more faculty within our
department. Both domestic and international applicants are welcome, but
applicants must have a Ph.D. awarded within three years of the time of
appointment.

Applicants are requested to develop a proposal of research to be
undertaken during the fellowship period. The principal selection
criteria are scientific excellence, a clearly expressed research plan
to address questions at the forefront of their field of study, and
research synergies with at least one faculty. The proposed research
should, however, encompass independent research ideas and explore new
directions beyond the applicant's Ph.D. Preference will be given to
applicants whose proposals demonstrate independence and originality,
and also the potential for collaboration with one or more faculty in
the Department of Earth, Environmental and Planetary Sciences.

The application for both fellowships is due on 1 November, 2018.
