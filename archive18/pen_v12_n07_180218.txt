OCEAN WORLDS 3

In the next of a series of Ocean Worlds meetings, the focus will be on 
the potential for silicate-water interactions to occur on Ocean Worlds 
beyond Earth, from a multi-disciplinary and inter-disciplinary 
perspective. As with past Ocean Worlds meetings, a primary motivation 
is to engender a cross-fertilization of ideas and expertise by 
soliciting contributions from both the Ocean Sciences and Planetary 
Sciences communities. Consequently, contributions are invited that 
address any aspects of this broad water-rock interaction theme, across 
the Planetary and Ocean Science fields, including geophysics, 
hydrogeology, geochemistry and microbiology. The meeting will be held 
at LPI from May 21st - 24th. Abstract deadline is March, 7th 2018.

LARGE SYNOPTIC SURVEY TELESCOPE SOLAR SYSTEM SCIENCE ROADMAP

Schwamb et al. for the LSST SSSC:

https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.01783 

The Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) is uniquely equipped to 
search for Solar System bodies due to its unprecedented combination of 
depth and wide field coverage. Over a ten-year period starting in 2022, 
LSST will generate the largest catalog of Solar System objects to date. 
The main goal of the LSST Solar System Science Collaboration (SSSC) is 
to facilitate the efforts of the planetary community to study the 
planets and small body populations residing within our Solar System 
using LSST data. To prepare for future survey cadence decisions and 
ensure that interesting and novel Solar System science is achievable 
with LSST, the SSSC has identified and prioritized key Solar System 
research areas for investigation with LSST in this roadmap. The ranked 
science priorities highlighted in this living document will inform LSST 
survey cadence decisions and aid in identifying software tools and 
pipelines needed to be developed by the planetary community as added 
value products and resources before the planned start of LSST science 
operations. Feedback welcome.

LPSC

The Spacecraft Planetary Imaging Facility (SPIF) at Cornell University 
is offering a free workshop at the upcoming 49th LPSC on Sunday, 
March 18, on using ArcGIS for planetary image analysis, sponsored by 
the Regional Planetary Image Facility (RPIF) network. This will be an 
introductory level course accessible to participants with no prior 
ArcGIS experience. The workshop will run from 9:30am to 4:30pm and will 
cover topics including ArcGIS basics, spatial analysis, and map 
document production. Participants will conduct hands-on research using 
data from Mars Odyssey and Mars Global Surveyor that will be 
downloaded and processed for ingestion into ArcGIS as part of the 
workshop. Some introductory ISIS information will be provided as well:

https://isis.astrogeology.usgs.gov

Participants will be given one year ArcGIS licenses part of the 
workshop. Registration is required:

[NASA] EXOBIOLOGY PROPOSALS DUE MAY 2018

Important Notice to the Astrobiology Community: A change has been made 
for 2018 Exobiology proposals to Notices of Intent (NOIs) in place of 
Step-1 proposals and a change in due dates from previous years: NOIs 
are due on April 16, 2018, and full proposals are due on May 24, 2018.

Included in the ROSES 2018 solicitation is the Exobiology Program:

https://nspires.nasaprs.com/external/solicitations/summary!init.do
?solId=%7bE2CB9318-72CB-C51A-6962-013E762AE713%7d&path=open

This is an element of the NASA Astrobiology Program:

https://astrobiology.nasa.gov/research/astrobiology-at-nasa/exobiology

Research in Exobiology is centered on the origin and early evolution of 
life, the potential of life to adapt to different environments, and the 
implications for life elsewhere. This research is conducted in the 
context of NASA's ongoing exploration of our stellar neighborhood and 
the identification of biosignatures for in situ and remote sensing 
applications.

PLANETARY SESSIONS AT THE MAY GSA CORDILLERAN-ROCKY MOUNTAIN JOINT
MEETING

May 15-17, 2018
Flagstaff, AZ

We invite contributions to the following planetary sessions:

T21. Recent Advances in Planetary Geoscience. How the volume and
diversity of recent data sets have significantly advanced our
understanding of the geologic character and evolution of bodies in the
Solar System.

T22. Earth as a Stepping Stone for Planetary Exploration. Terrestrial
research in the field and in the laboratory is necessary for advancing
planetary exploration.

T23. Integrating Composition and Morphology: Keys to Constraining
Planetary Surface Processes from Spacecraft Data. Compositional
interpretations critically augment geomorphological and/or
sedimentological studies to yield a refined understanding of geologic
context and surface processes.

T24. Understanding Basin Environments and Evolution Beyond Earth.
Though topographic and structural basins exist beyond Earth, lack of
direct access makes deciphering exposed units a challenge.
 
There also will be a full-day post-conference field trip on May 18 to
planetary analog sites in northern Arizona (The Holey Tour).

Abstract deadline is February 20, 2018. More information can be
obtained at the meeting website:

DIFFERENTIATION CONFERENCE: ABSTRACT DEADLINE MARCH 1

The abstract deadline for Differentiation: Building the Internal 
Architecture of Planets is March 1. The focus of this conference is on 
understanding the physical and chemical conditions associated with the
formation of crusts, cores, atmospheres, and oceans on both rocky and 
volatile-rich bodies. We seek input from many types of studies, 
including petrologic, isotopic, trace element, and paleo-magnetic
analyses of samples, geophysical probes of planetary interiors, and 
experimental and numerical simulations. There will be an optional, 
pre-conference field trip to an anorthosite complex in the San Gabriel 
Mountains on May 7. The conference will consist of 3.5 days of 
presentations and discussion, May 8-11, ending by noon on May 11. 
Abstracts are limited to one page and should be submitted via the 
conference website:

http://www.hou.usra.edu/meetings/differentiation2018 

Some travel support will be available for early career individuals and 
should also be applied for via the conference website.
