PLANETARY SCIENCE SLIDES AND ILLUSTRATIONS

Planetary Science Research Discoveries (PSRD) has sets of Powerpoint 
slides for your use. These are summaries of PSRD articles covering 
planetary science, including the processes by which planets, moons, and 
small bodies form and evolve. The slides have captions and notes, and 
are linked to PSRD articles that provide the full context, additional 
graphics, and primary sources. New content added monthly. Use our 
search box to find just what you need.

The Cosmochemistry Illustrated website offers additional Powerpoint 
slides with planetary examples to enrich geochemistry, petrology, and 
introductory geology lectures. References and background are given in 
the notes pages.

POST-DOCTORAL POSITIONS - EXPERIMENTAL STUDY OF COMETARY ACTIVITY

The Universities of Bern (Switzerland) and Braunschweig (Germany) 
invite applications for a Postdoctoral Scholar at each institution to 
conduct experimental studies of cometary activity within the framework 
of a 3-years joint research project ("D-A-CH" project) between Bern, 
Braunschweig and Graz (Austria). The detailed descriptions of both 
positions and instructions to apply can be found at: 

http://www.space.unibe.ch/research/research_groups/planetary_imaging
_group_pig/open_positions/index_eng.html

The review of complete applications will begin in September and the 
positions will remain open until suitable candidates are hired.
