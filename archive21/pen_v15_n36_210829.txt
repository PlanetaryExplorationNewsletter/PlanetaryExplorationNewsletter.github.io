DEIA SURVEY FROM THE NATIONAL ACADEMIES OF SCIENCES, ENGINEERING AND 
MEDICINE

The National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (NASEM), 
under a contract with NASA, has subcontracted with NORC at the 
University of Chicago to implement an important research study to 
understand the factors that impede or facilitate diversity, equity, 
inclusion, and accessibility in the proposed leadership for competed 
space missions at the NASA.

Participation in this study will comprise a 45-60-minute virtual 
discussion with an interviewer from NORC. Your participation in the 
study will NOT be made known to NASA or NASEM, and NO staff outside of 
the NORC Study Team will know your identity or be involved in the 
discussion itself. All interview responses will be kept confidential 
and stored separately from your contact information, and NORC will not 
share your contact information or interview responses with anyone 
outside our study team. 

If you are interested in participating in the study, please complete 
this short Study Eligibility Survey by August 25, 2021:

https://norc.az1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_dnCQsdxJUtl5W4u

or reply to sawyer-heather@norc.org.

The NORC study team will contact you within a few weeks to schedule an 
interview if you are eligible to participate.

LOW-COST MARS 2022: CALL FOR ABSTRACTS

The Low-Cost Science Mission Concepts for Mars Exploration 
(#LowCostMars2022) workshop is scheduled for January 11-13, 2022, in 
the Southern California area (final location to be announced soon). 
Emerging small spacecraft capabilities and innovative new mission 
concepts offer opportunities for compelling science discoveries at 
Mars at unprecedented low costs. NASA's Mars Exploration Program 
invites the community to this three-day workshop to explore this 
potential new class of Mars missions from multiple perspectives. In 
this forum, Mars scientists, engineers, technologists, and industry 
representatives will share ideas and approaches for low-cost 
exploration of the Red Planet. Here, "low-cost" equates to mission 
costs that fall well below the current Discovery Program cost cap. The 
recent Mars Architecture Strategy Working Group suggested that small 
spacecraft missions in the $100-$300M cost range (including delivery) 
may offer a sweet spot in terms of achievable science per unit cost. 
Missions in this class could represent an important new program 
element in a future balanced portfolio of Mars missions.

Abstract submission deadline: October 28, 2021, 5:00 p.m. U.S. 
Central Daylight Time (GMT -5).

The Department of the Geophysical Sciences at The University of Chicago 
invites applications for the T.C. Chamberlin Postdoctoral Fellowship. 
We seek outstanding scientists who lead creative investigations into 
the nature and evolution of the Earth and/or other planetary bodies-
including their physics, biology, chemistry, climate, and history-and 
who have a desire to participate in the broad intellectual life of the 
department and the university. Ongoing research activities within the 
department can be found on the department website:

https://geosci.uchicago.edu/

We encourage people with interests in any aspect of earth and planetary 
sciences to apply. To give a sense of the diverse interests of our 
Chamberlin Fellows, in recent years they have carried out 
investigations of planetary habitability, tropical cyclones, 
paleontology, and planetary dynamics, and geochronology.

Start date is negotiable, with a target of September 1, 2022. The 
initial term of the Fellowships will be one year, renewable for a 
second year. For more information and to apply, please see:

ESA RESEARCH FELLOWSHIPS IN SPACE SCIENCE

ESA's postdoctoral Research Fellowship programme offers early career 
scientists and engineers the possibility to carry out research in a 
variety of disciplines related to space science, space applications or 
space technology. Research Fellowships in Space Science specifically 
offer the opportunity to contribute to ESA's endeavour to explore our 
Solar System and the Universe, and cover the fields of heliophysics, 
planetary science, astrophysics and fundamental physics. 

The research fellowships offer a unique insight into ESA's environment 
and activities while conducting cutting edge research. Mentoring and 
training opportunities are available, as are possibilities to engage 
with ESA science-related activities (e.g., archive/data science, 
operations, calibration, communication, citizen science). 

Duration: Appointments are for a maximum of three years. The initial 
project is for two years. An extension for a third year requires a 
dedicated proposal and is frequently granted.

Eligibility: Citizens of ESA Member States or of cooperating and 
associated countries.

PH.D. STUDENT IN SPACE PHYSICS FOR STUDIES OF SATURN'S MOON TITAN

Swedish Institute of Space Physics is looking for a Ph.D. student in 
Space Physics for studies of Saturn's moon Titan

Applications are invited for a Ph.D. student position to study the 
plasma environment of Saturn's moon Titan. The work will mainly 
consist of data analysis from our instrument on the Cassini satellite, 
but also modelling, with focus on dynamic processes in Titan's plasma 
environment.

Titan's ionosphere has proven to be a very dynamic environment where 
many physical processes are occurring on different time scales, from 
seconds to years. The goal of this project is to understand these 
processes in greater detail.

The position is available for a total duration of four years at IRF 
Uppsala office, located at the Angstrom Laboratory, Sweden.

Contact: Dr Niklas Edberg, ne@irfu.se

Application: registrator@irf.se

Closing date applications: September 20, 2021
