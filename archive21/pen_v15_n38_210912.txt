ESA ARCHIVAL RESEARCH VISITOR PROGRAMME

To increase the scientific return from its space science missions, the
European Space Agency (ESA) welcomes applications from scientists
interested in pursuing research projects based on data publicly 
available in the ESA Space Science Archives.

The ESA Archival Research Visitor Programme is open to scientists, at 
all career levels, affiliated with institutes in ESA Member States and
Collaborating States. Early-career scientists, including PhD students, 
are particularly encouraged to apply.

During their stay, visiting scientists will have access to archives and
mission specialists for help with the retrieval, calibration, and 
analysis of archival data. In principle, all areas of space research 
covered by ESA science missions can be supported.

Residence lasts typically between one and three months, also 
distributed over multiple visits. Research projects can be carried out 
at ESAC (Madrid, Spain) and at ESTEC (Noordwijk, Netherlands). To 
offset the expenses incurred by visitors, ESA covers travel costs and 
provides support for lodging expenses and meals.

Applications received before November 1, 2021, will be considered for 
visits in spring/summer 2022.

For further details, including areas of research and contact 
information, write to arvp@cosmos.esa.int, or go to:

ISSOL VIRTUAL MEETING

ISSOL, the International Society for the Study of the Origin of Life, 
will host an interim virtual meeting October 18-22, 2021. ISSOL, the 
premier society for Origins of Life research boasts more than 500 
members representing over 20 countries in disciplines ranging from 
astronomy to molecular biology. This exciting meeting will feature 
diverse speakers from around the world on topics related to the most 
recent research regarding the origin and emergence of life on Earth and 
beyond. Speakers were selected by the Scientific Organizing Committee 
to represent the wide range of scientific approaches to these 
questions. The meeting will also host two contributed poster sessions 
which will allow ALL attendees to share their work with the community 
in an interactive virtual environment.

Meeting session themes will include:

1. Solar systems, exoplanets, and meteorites
2. The early Earth: Environmental condition and early organic molecules
3. Chemical evolution towards the transition of life, including the 
   role of minerals
4. Self-organization and prebiotic molecular systems
5. Lipids, compartments, and early metabolism
6. Nucleic acids, peptides, and other polymers, and their function in 
   early stages of life
7. Evolution: before and after LUCA, towards competition, 
   cooperativity, and complexity

INTERSTELLAR PROBE WORKSHOP: CALLING ALL STUDENTS

Are you interested in learning about mission concept development? Are 
you wanting to learn more about the upcoming Solar and Space Physics 
Decadal Survey? Do you have a passion for interstellar exploration?

The Interstellar Probe Study team is looking forward to the 4th annual 
Fall Workshop that will bring together the many science and engineering 
experts who have been working to answer questions critical to 
understanding the scope of a potential interstellar probe mission.

The workshop will be held the week of 27 September to October 1, 2021. 
This event will be held virtually. Registration is required, so sign up

EANA21 OUTSTANDING PAPER AWARD

The European Astrobiology Network association (EANA) is celebrating its 
20th anniversary this year. For that reason, EANA organized several 
special events and activities in 2021. One of these activities was the 
EANA outstanding paper award contest. The winner has been announced:

Fairen et al., "The Complex Molecules Detector (CMOLD): A 
fluidic-based instrument suite to search for (bio)chemical complexity 
on Mars and icy moons". Astrobiology, 20(9), pp.1076-1096 (2020), 
https://doi.org/10.1089/ast.2019.2167

The paper proposed a novel astrobiologically-focused instrument suite 
that could be included in future missions to Mars or the icy moons.

The award was presented to the authors, Friday September 10, by Andre 
Brack, president of the jury and first President of EANA, and by the 
current President of EANA, Barbara Cavalazzi, during the closing 
ceremony of the 20th EANA Congress, held from September 7 to 10, 2021.
