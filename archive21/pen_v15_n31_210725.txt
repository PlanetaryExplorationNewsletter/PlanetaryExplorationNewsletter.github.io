OPPORTUNITIES FOR AGU FALL MEETING CONFERENCE REIMBURSEMENT

To make the 2021 AGU Fall Meeting as widely accessible as possible, and
to gauge community need, the Planetary Sciences Section of AGU wants to
offer partial or full reimbursement of registration costs to those for
whom registration expenses present a barrier to attendance. At this
time, we cannot gauge the level of reimbursement we will be able to
provide, or guarantee that all need will be met, and we are,
unfortunately, unable to waive registration fees in advance.
Applications are kindly requested by August 31, and can be completed 
through this Google form:

AGU SESSION P006: CLAY-SULFATE TRANSITIONS AS INDICATORS OF CLIMATE
CHANGE ACROSS MARS

Mapping of Mars' surface has revealed associations between
phyllosilicate minerals and older terrains, and between sulfate
minerals and younger terrains. This arrangement is hypothesized to be
evidence for planetary-scale climate change, from conditions that
favored the formation of phyllosilicates (e.g., higher water/rock
ratio, moderate pH) to those that favored sulfates (e.g., lower
water/rock ratio, lower pH). In early 2021, Curiosity began traversing
through a region that orbital data suggest records such a mineralogical
transition in a single stratigraphic sequence. Curiosity has
investigated over 400 vertical meters of strata dominated by
phyllosilicate-bearing, lacustrine mudstone. However, spectra from the
CRISM and OMEGA instruments imply that the rover will soon reach strata
with variable abundances of mono- and polyhydrated sulfates. We invite
presentations on Curiosity results and those that provide context, such
as what has been learned from orbit, in situ exploration of
phyllosilicate- and sulfate-bearing strata, and laboratory or field
analog studies.

We welcome your submissions by August 4:

AGU SESSION P003: ATMOSPHERIC DYNAMICS AND ASTRO-/GEO-PHYSICAL MODELING
STUDIES OF HABITABLE OCEAN WORLDS, MOONS, AND ATMOSPHERES NEAR AND FAR

The realm of Geophysical and Astrophysical Fluid Dynamics (GAFD) has
significantly expanded in phase space to include a wide variety of
physical regimes. Models originally developed for phenomena on Earth
and the Solar System are now being applied to exoplanets. Atmospheric
circulation models are being tested against new observational
constraints, as from the Juno Mission. On the other Reynolds number
extreme, modeling convection in ice shells offer explanations for
geological features on the surfaces of ocean worlds across the Solar
System. In addition, astrophysical tools are now being applied to
planetary science problems. This session aims to bring together a wide
cross-section of these diverse communities that use a variety of
practices and methods. We expect an engaging session that focuses on
new results in exoplanetary and Solar System science, as well as
computational methodology.

This session honors Adam Showman (1968-2020) by representing the broad
research topics studied by during his career. 

The abstract submission deadline is August 4:

AGU SESSION A032: CHEMICAL PHYSICS INSIGHTS INTO ATMOSPHERIC AND 
PLANETARY CHEMISTRY

We would like to draw your attention to a chemical physics/physical
chemistry session at American Geophysical Union (AGU) Fall meeting
2021, entitled Chemical Physics Insights into Atmospheric and Planetary
Chemistry. Tackling the most demanding, unresolved problems in
atmospheric and planetary chemistry requires broad collaboration.
Fundamental science results obtained from detailed, state-of-the-art
experimental, theoretical, and computational studies complement and
facilitate our understanding of the holistic, more complex chemical
environments of simulation chamber studies and atmospheric observations
(both in situ and remote sensing). Through this session, we hope to
bring more theoretical and experimental scientists from physical
chemistry and chemical physics to AGU. The session aims to foster new
interdisciplinary discussions and collaborations, as well as to share
fundamental insights into timely topics in atmospheric and planetary
chemistry.

The abstract submission deadline is August 4:

AGU SESSION P008: ENCELADUS - BEACON OF OCEAN WORLDS

Saturn's moon Enceladus continues to captivate. Its diversity of ocean
world processes offers a bounty of phenomena for fundamental science,
including cryovolcanism and plume dynamics, surface geology and the
tectonics of ice, tidal heating, interior structure, ocean circulation
dynamics, water-rock geochemistry, hydrothermal systems, the origin and
evolution of icy bodies, and much more. Enceladus is a gateway to alien
oceans. Furthermore, Enceladus is one of the prime destinations for
astrobiology, because of the easy access to ocean-derived materials,
and because it appears to be tantalizingly habitable. Many of us are
now asking how Enceladus can support life, and how might we search for
evidence of life?

This hybrid session (in person and virtual options) brings our diverse
community together to discuss the current state of understanding of all
things Enceladus. We also welcome contributions that contextualize
Enceladus with other areas of Earth and Planetary Sciences, or provide
perspectives on the future of Enceladus exploration.

AGU SESSION P037: THE NEW MARS UNDERGROUND - ASTROBIOLOGY AND SPACE 
RESOURCES AT THE DAWN OF MARS SAMPLE RETURN

The next era of Mars exploration has begun, with current and future
missions highlighting the importance of subsurface science for sample
return, astrobiology, and human exploration. Signs of recent
groundwater and active gas emissions have been identified by the
Curiosity rover. Martian subsurface structure is probed with
unprecedented precision via seismic and ground-penetrating radar
measurements by the InSight lander and Perseverance rover. Caches for
Mars Sample Return will include past subsurface materials that are now
exposed at the surface. Future subsurface-oriented Mars missions will
revolutionize our understanding of martian habitability, climate, and
geologic history. These missions will apply technologies for
prospecting and accessing in situ resources on Mars, enabling human
exploration, and testing technologies for subsurface exploration
of other planetary bodies. We invite submissions describing
investigations of the martian subsurface, analog terrestrial deep
biosphere sites, and subsurface exploration of other planetary bodies.

Abstract deadline is August 4:

AGU SESSION P024: PALEOHYDROLOGY AND FLUVIAL DYNAMICS OF MARTIAN 
CHANNELS

Martian channels have been studied at increasing spatial resolution
over the past two decades enabling compelling interpretations of
extra-terrestrial fluvial processes. Paleodeltas that may follow
gravitational equipotential surfaces have been uncovered, along with
possible Noachian precipitation-driven fluvial activity. Exceptionally
preserved fluvial morphologies on Mars display complexities that offer
a window into the character and dynamics of the surface paleohydrology
from when they were active. Evidence is building for the possibilities
of periglacial fluvial systems and oceans. Additionally, comparative
morphological studies between Earth and Mars may yield insights into
flow characteristics. While paleochannels have been examined to
interpret paleohydrology and paleoclimate in numerous works,
quantitative analysis of channel dynamics, especially temporal
evolution of the hydrology underlying positive relief channels, remains
under-explored. Accordingly, we welcome abstracts on interpreting the
temporal evolution of martian channels, including those associated with
landforms (e.g., alluvial fans and deltas), as well as on underlying
climatic variations.

Abstract submission deadline is August 4:

EUROPEAN SOLAR SYSTEM PLASMA COMMUNITY (ESSPC)

Over the last few years the need for the organization of the European 
Solar System Plasma Community (ESSPC) has been discussed throughout 
the community.

To continue coordination across the related fields that include
ionospheric and magnetospheric physics, planetary magnetospheric
environments, solar wind plasma, cometary plasmas, and solar plasmas,
we would like to invite the members of the European community and those
who are interested in collaborating with the European Solar System
Plasma community, to join our mailing list.

We are currently planning a meeting to discuss how to move forward with
coordination across disciplines, countries, and agencies, as well as
how to set up European priorities and objectives. Additionally, we will
discuss the name of the group and how we can organize future meetings
and other community events and activities. The details of the meeting
will be announced through the mailing list.

JOB ANNOUNCEMENT: PH.D. STUDENT TO DEVELOP A CHON+PS CHEMICAL SCHEME
VALIDATED AT HIGH TEMPERATURES WITH APPLICATIONS IN PLANETOLOGY

The broad wavelength coverage and high-sensitivity of the instruments
on-board the JWST and Ariel telescopes will allow us to extract much
more information from their data than what has been possible so far,
leading to numerous breakthroughs. However, these breakthroughs will be
possible only if the models used to interpret the observations are
robust and reliable, in particular, photo-thermochemical models. While
models taking into account Carbon, Hydrogen, Oxygen, and Nitrogen
species (CHON) already exist, Sulfur- and Phosphorous-bearing molecules
can affect the observations of exoplanets' atmospheres and thus need to
be incorporated in models. The PhD candidate will develop a
comprehensive CHON+PS scheme and will apply this scheme to the study of
exoplanetary atmospheres, using a kinetic model.

We are looking for an extremely motivated student who will be fully
involved in a challenging interdisciplinary project linking the fields
of combustion and astrophysics. The PhD candidate will have a double
expertise, both in chemical schemes development and in atmospheric
modeling.
