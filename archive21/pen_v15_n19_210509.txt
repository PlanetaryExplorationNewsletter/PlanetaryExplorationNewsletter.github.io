[NASA] ROSES-21: C.27 VIPER MISSION CO-INVESTIGATOR PROGRAM

The Volatiles Investigating Polar Exploration Rover (VIPER) Mission is 
expected to arrive at the Moon in November 2023, with the overall 
science objectives of: 1) Characterizing the distribution and physical 
state of lunar polar water and other volatiles in lunar cold traps and 
regolith to understand their origin; and 2) Providing the data and 
resource maps necessary for NASA to evaluate the potential of In Situ 
Resource Utilization (ISRU) from the lunar polar regions.

The VIPER Mission Co-Investigator Program solicits proposals for adding 
Co-Is to the VIPER team. Co-Is are being brought on board early in the 
mission's development and expected to be fully engaged in all aspects 
of development and operations. The goals of the program are to: a) 
enhance the scientific return from the VIPER mission by broadening 
participation in the mission and b) augment the existing VIPER science 
team to include new members conducting investigations that broaden 
and/or complement the already funded Principal Investigator and 
Co-Investigator-led inquires, thus maximizing the contribution of VIPER 
to the future exploration and scientific understanding of the Moon.

DART BOARDERS PROGRAM

Reminder: The Double Asteroid Redirection Test (DART) Investigation 
Team is inviting a select number of senior graduate students and early 
career scientists (less than 7 years since terminal degree) to be "DART 
Boarders" to observe our next mission Investigation Team meeting from 
June 14-18, 2021. We anticipate a time commitment of roughly 16-20 
hours spread over the week of the team meeting, with a few introductory 
hours the prior week. 

This opportunity is open to advanced graduate students and early career 
scientists regardless of nationality. Respondents will be selected 
based upon the anticipated impact to their career path and the 
alignment of their research interests with the scientific objectives of 
the mission, while giving preference to candidates who do not have 
existing connections to the team via existing advisor-student 
relationships. DART recognizes and supports the benefits of having 
diverse and inclusive communities and expects that such values will be 
reflected in this opportunity. Questions can be sent to 
andy.rivkin@jhuapl.edu with the subject line "DART Boarders". 

Please indicate your interest by filling out the following form by

RESEARCH ANALOG MISSION RECRUITMENT

A DARPA-funded project team is now taking applications for 6-person 
crews for four analog missions scheduled for September and October 
2021, and Spring/Summer 2022. The 28-day missions follow a 
planetary/lunar surface operations model, with a high tempo and 
multiple field performance activities in the challenging physical, 
cognitive, and social environment of the HI-SEAS operational research 
site:

https://www.hi-seas.org

EPSC SESSION TP7: CRUISE AND PLANETARY FLYBY INVESTIGATIONS THROUGH 
SPACE MISSIONS

Virtual meeting, September 13-24, 2021

In the latest years, many spacecraft missions operating in the Solar 
System are collecting data from the many regions of the heliosphere, 
sensibly increasing the scientific return of each mission, and 
providing additional opportunities for synergistic data acquisitions 
from environments and conditions that are different from each mission's 
original baseline science operation plan.

A bright example is the Venus atmosphere and magnetosphere 
investigations recently performed by BepiColombo, Parker Solar Probe 
and Solar Orbiter during their flybys, as well as their coordination 
with Akatsuki and with space and Earth-based telescope observations. In 
this session, we welcome contributions to any kind of planetary and 
Solar System investigations made by space missions during their cruise 
and flybys operations.

EPSC SESSION TP10: IONOSPHERES OF UNMAGNETIZED OR WEAKLY MAGNETIZED 
BODIES

Virtual meeting, September 13-24, 2021

Ionospheres play an important role in controlling the dynamics of the 
system, as they are the link between the neutral atmosphere, exosphere 
and surrounding plasma environments (e.g. the solar wind for Mars, 
Venus, Pluto and comets, and the Kronian magnetosphere for Titan). 
Understanding how each unmagnetized body reacts to all these factors is 
a key in comparative aeronomy because although a priori all of them 
have a general similar behaviour, they also have scientifically 
important differences caused by their different natures. This session 
focuses on the ionospheres of Mars, Venus, Pluto, Titan, and comets, 
and solicits abstracts concerning remote and in situ data analysis, 
modelling studies, instrumentation and mission concepts. Abstracts on 
general plasma and escape processes are also welcome.

https://meetingorganizer.copernicus.org/EPSC2021/session/41633

Deadline: May 26, 2021

Conveners: Beatriz Sanchez-Cano, Niklas Edberg, Xiaohua Fang, 
Christopher Fowler, Francisco Gonzalez-Galindo, Yingjuan Ma

EPSC SESSION TP14: MERCURY SCIENCE AND OBSERVATIONS

Virtual meeting, September 13-24, 2021

Understanding the formation, evolution, composition, the interior 
structure and the environment of Mercury is a primary goal of the 
ESA/JAXA BepiColombo mission and of many theoretical, observational, 
and experimental studies. NASA's MESSENGER spacecraft provided many 
new insights and surprising results regarding these goals. However, 
the mission also raised many new questions that will be addressed by 
ESA/JAXA BepiColombo that has been successfully launched in October 
2018. This session welcomes contributions addressing the planet's 
geology, surface composition, geodesy, interior structure, laboratory 
measurements, ground-based observations, exosphere, magnetosphere, 
gravity and magnetic fields and all those work related to the 
investigation of this terrestrial planet.

A second focus lies on plans for new mission ideas to Mercury including 
Mercury landing modules.

[NASA] ROSES-21: SPACE WEATHER SCIENCE APPLICATION 
RESEARCH-TO-OPERATIONS-TO-RESEARCH TEXT LENGTH INCREASE AND DUE DATE 
EXTENSION

The primary goal of the Space Weather Science Application 
Research-to-Operations-to-Research (SWR2O2R) program is to support 
research to improve numerical models and/or data utilization techniques 
that could advance specification and/or forecasting capabilities and 
which could also lead to improved scientific understanding.

The two application-oriented areas of focus for this opportunity are:

Cis-Lunar Environment Forecast: Develop improved space weather 
application models and operational forecasts for the cis-lunar domain 
as it pertains to increasing government and commercial activity and 
Solar Flare Activity Forecast: Improve the skill of short-term, 
probabilistic flare forecasts based on currently observable inputs as 
they pertain to direct (ionosphere) and indirect (CMEs, SPEs) events 
that directly impact the geospace environment and impact deep space 
exploration.

ROSES-2021 Amendment 15 increases the length of the page-limited S/T/M 
Section for proposals to B.7 SWR2O2R from 10 to 12 pages and the due 
date has been delayed. Step-2 proposals are now due June 10, 2021.

[NASA] ROSES-21: A.17 ARCSIX CHANGE TO FIELD CAMPAIGN SCHEDULE AND 
BUDGET

The Radiation Sciences and Cryosphere Programs are jointly soliciting 
proposals for participation in an airborne campaign to be conducted in 
the Arctic. The Arctic Radiation-Cloud-Aerosol-Surface-Interaction 
Experiment (ARCSIX) is an airborne investigation from Northern 
Greenland and possibly Svalbard.

The ARCSIX field campaign will be deferred to May through mid-July, 
2024. Consequently:

1. Instrument proposals may request funding for up to six years and 
   flight planning proposals may request funding for up to four years.
2. First year funding should cover the cost of a virtual science team 
   meeting and, for flight planning proposals, support for a modest 
   amount of preparation and practice flight planning.
3. Second year funding should cover the cost of preparing for the 
   field campaign and an in-person science team meeting.
4. Third year funding should cover the costs associated with the 
   field campaign.
5. Funding in post-campaign project years should be as originally 
   specified in this ROSES element.

The due date for proposals remains unchanged: Notices of Intent to 
propose are not requested and proposals are due October 15, 2021.
