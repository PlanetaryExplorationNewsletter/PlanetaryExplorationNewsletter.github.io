DART BOARDERS PROGRAM

The Double Asteroid Redirection Test (DART) Investigation Team is 
organizing a pilot program intended to expose early career scientists 
to the experience of working on a mission team. We are inviting a 
select number of senior graduate students and early career scientists 
(less than 7 years since terminal degree) to be "DART Boarders" to 
observe our next mission Investigation Team meeting from June 14-18, 
2021. We anticipate a time commitment of roughly 16-20 hours spread 
over the week of the team meeting, with a few introductory hours the 
prior week. 

The team meeting will be virtual and held during typical North 
American working hours. Respondents will be selected based upon the 
anticipated impact to their career path and the alignment of their 
research interests with the scientific objectives of the mission, 
while giving preference to candidates who do not have existing 
connections to the team via existing advisor-student relationships. 
DART recognizes and supports the benefits of having diverse and 
inclusive communities and expects that such values will be reflected 
in this opportunity. Questions can be sent to andy.rivkin@jhuapl.edu 
with the subject line "DART Boarders".

Please fill out the following form by Tuesday, 11 May, 2021:

[NASA] ROSES 21: FINAL TEXT FOR F.2 TOPICAL WORKSHOPS, SYMPOSIA, AND
CONFERENCES

Through Topical Workshops, Symposia, and Conferences (TWSC), the 
Science Mission Directorate (SMD) solicits proposals for community 
events, including asynchronous and virtual workshops, etc., that 
contribute to SMD's science, technology and exploration goals. Because 
there is no central or dedicated TWSC funding, proposal submission 
requires designation of at least one reviewing division or office. 
Proposals that are relevant to more than one division also are welcome. 
Awards will be primarily grants.

This amendment releases the final text for F.2 TWSC, which had been 
listed as "TBD". Proposals may be submitted at any time until May 13, 
2022.

This program element does not accept Notices of Intent, but potential 
proposers must confirm relevancy and availability of funds before 
preparing or submitting a proposal with a SMD program officer listed 
at: 

https://science.nasa.gov/researchers/sara/program-officers-list

For the text of the amended announcement, go to:

http://solicitation.nasaprs.com/ROSES2021

General questions concerning F.2 TWSC may be directed to Mary Frances 
Sladek, TWSC's coordinating point of contact.

NEW PLANETARY SOCIETY SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY FUNDING OPPORTUNITY

The Planetary Society invites proposals to its new grants program: 
Science and Technology Empowered by the Public (STEP) Grants. These are 
planetary science and/or technology grants chosen from an open, 
international, competed proposal process. Proposals must fit within one 
or more of The Planetary Society's core enterprises (Explore Worlds, 
Find Life, Defend Earth). All funding will come from Planetary Society 
members and donors. Grant winners need to provide regular, short 
project updates and be willing to support The Planetary Society's 
efforts to share the content and excitement of the project with members 
and the public. Preliminary proposals (pre-proposals) are due May 26,
2021. Based on the pre-proposal submissions, a small number of 
proposers will be invited to submit full proposals from which grant 
selections will be made. For this first round of STEP Grants, the 
nominal expectation is two awards at approximately the US$50,000 level 
each. More information can be found at:

POSTDOCTORAL RESEARCH SCIENTIST POSITION AT THE PLANETARY SCIENCE 
INSTITUTE

Applications are invited for a Postdoctoral Research Scientist to work 
with Dr. R. Aileen Yingst in the sedimentologic and stratigraphic 
analysis of deposits in Jezero crater, and elsewhere on Mars. 
Dr. Yingst is a Co-Investigator on Mars 2020's SHERLOC instrument, an 
arm-mounted fluorescence and Raman spectrometer coupled with a 
hand-lens scale resolution pair of RGB cameras (ACI and WATSON). The 
successful candidate will be expected to focus on analysis and 
interpretation of the fine-scale texture of rocks, grains, outcrop and 
unconsolidated targets through examination of WATSON images (WATSON 
acquires images at better than 20 um/pixel in RGB color), in 
combination with other M2020 instruments. The successful candidate will 
work collaboratively with Dr. Yingst to draw connections from the 
fine-scale data derived from WATSON to the broader analysis of 
rover-and orbital-derived images to reconstruct the local and regional 
geologic history of Jezero crater.

ROCKY WORLDS II CONFERENCE

Janury 10-12, 2022 
Oxford, United Kingdom

Registration deadline: September 30, 2021 

https://www.rockyworlds.org

The detailed understanding gleaned from the terrestrial planets in the 
Solar System is crucial in the interpretation of extrasolar planets. As 
the characterisation of these new planetary systems proceeds, it in 
turn improves our understanding of the Solar System, and in particular 
of how potentially habitable worlds form, evolve, and are distributed 
throughout the galaxy. 

The newly established Rocky Worlds conference series brings together 
planetary scientists, astronomers, and earth scientists to foster 
discussion and build collaborations that will pave the way for the next 
decade of rocky exoplanet discovery and characterisation.

Confirmed invited speakers: 

Nathalie Carrasco, Linda Elkins-Tanton, Rebecca Fischer, Sascha Quanz, 
Elishevah van Kooten, Allona Vazan

Scientific organisers: 

Tim Lichtenberg, Amy Bonsor, Vivien Parmentier, James Bryson, Oliver
