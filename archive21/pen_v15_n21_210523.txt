[NASA] ROSES-21 AMENDMENT 22: PAYLOADS AND RESEARCH INVESTIGATIONS ON
THE SURFACE OF THE MOON (PRISM) DRAFT TEXT RELEASED FOR COMMUNITY
COMMENT

PRISM solicits the development and flight of science-driven
suites of instruments and technology demonstration payloads that
address science goals related to the Moon of any SMD division. They
may, in addition, also address: 1) Strategic Knowledge Gaps of HEOMD
and/or 2) any technology demonstration goals of STMD that advance
capabilities for science, exploration, or commercial development of the
Moon.

NASA expects to select suites for two CLPS deliveries expected to be a
south polar location in Q4 2024, and the Gruithuisen Domes in Q2 2025.
For more information read the draft text posted on the NSPIRES page for
ROSES-2021 F.10 PRISM.

Questions and comments should be addressed to Ryan Watkins and Brad
Bailey via HQ-PRISM@mail.nasa.gov by June 21, 2021.

EPSC2021 SESSION MITM2: SMALL SATELLITE AND DEDICATED INSTRUMENTS: A 
NEW OPPORTUNITY FOR PLANETARY EXPLORATION

The Europlanet Science Congress virtual meeting is September 13-24,
2021.

https://www.epsc2021.eu/

We invite you to submit an abstract to the session "Small Satellite and
Dedicated Instruments: A New Opportunity for Planetary Exploration"

This session will highlight planetary science and space mission
concepts based on small satellites. Recent advances in small platforms
make it possible for small satellites, including CubeSats, to be
considered as independent or complementary elements in planetary
exploration missions, for example the small probes as part of the
Hayabusa 2, DART and Hera mission. Presentations on Deep Space
Planetary CubeSats, e.g. the small satellites accompanying the F-class
ESA mission Comet Interceptor and those selected or proposed for the
NASA SIMPLEX program are welcomed. Concepts for future mission may
either be an augmentation to larger missions or as stand-alone missions
of their own. We encourage presentations on new planetary science
mission architectures and associated technologies, as well as dedicated
instrumentation that can be developed for these applications.

Abstract deadline: 26 May 2021, 13:00 CEST. Submit your abstract at:

EPSC2021 SESSION MITM8: MACHINE LEARNING IN PLANETARY SCIENCES

Please consider submitting an abstract to the EPSC session MITM8
"Machine Learning in Planetary Sciences" This will be a virtual
meeting held from September 13-24, 2021.

Due to an increasing amount of data from a continuously increasing
number of spacecraft in our Solar System, new frameworks for rapidly
and intelligently extracting information from these data sets are
needed. Machine learning provides such a framework for tackling a wide
range of research questions in planetary sciences. Machine learning
approaches could improve existing models, creating computationally
efficient algorithms for feature classification and regression
problems, e.g. solar wind time series data, planetary surface images
or hyperspectral data.

We encourage submissions dealing with machine learning approaches of
all levels in planetary sciences. In this session, we aim to provide
an overview of the current efforts to integrate machine learning
technologies into data driven space research and to highlight
state-of-the art developments. Share:

EPSC2021 SESSION ODAA6: THE ROLE OF CITIZEN SCIENCE IN SCIENTIFIC
RESEARCH: ACROSS DISCIPLINES AND BEYOND SCIENTISTS

Citizen science projects, while existing for a long time, have reached
new levels of impact on society and allow to engage the public and
connect citizen to professional researchers. In this session, we invite
papers from scientists, educators as well as those who design,
facilitate, evaluate or fund citizen science projects. Topics may
include methodology, applications of citizen science to enhancing
outreach, transformative approaches to science education.

The deadline for the abstract submission is 26 May 2021, 13:00 CEST.

EPSC2021 SESSION ODAA2: DIVERSITY AND INCLUSIVENESS IN PLANETARY
SCIENCES

The benefits of diversity and inclusiveness in the scientific community
are incontrovertible. Following the success of previous years, this
session aims to foster debate within the planetary sciences community
about the reasons behind under-representation of different groups
(gender, cultural, ethnic origin, and national) and best practices to
make the research environment more inclusive identifying and addressing
barriers to equality.

We invite abstracts focusing on: under-representation (gender,
cultural, ethnic origin, and nationality biases) supported by statistics
and data; outreach and education activities to reach broad and diverse
audiences, best practices to support inclusiveness; and case studies on
mentoring and bias-concerned activities. Data and initiatives related
to COVID are strongly encouraged.

The deadline for the abstract submission is May 26, 2021, 13:00 CEST.

POSTDOCTORAL FELLOW - AETHER PROGRAM

https://jobs.carnegiescience.edu/jobs/postdoctoral-fellow-aether-program/

The Earth and Planets Laboratory (EPL), Carnegie Institution for
Science in Washington D.C., seeks applications for a Postdoctoral
Fellow to investigate mantle solidification from a magma ocean state,
including chemical interactions with a primordial atmosphere. We are
committed to building a diverse and inclusive community at the Carnegie
Institution for Science.

This postdoctoral position is part of the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation
funded AEThER (Atmospheric Empirical, Theoretical, and Experimental
Research) team that is investigating how primary atmospheres form in
conjunction with the solidification of the mantle during planet
formation. The larger motivation is to aid in the search for life on
exoplanets by understanding how planetary atmospheres form and evolve. 

Minimum qualifications: The applicant must have completed a doctoral
degree in geophysics, physics, planetary science, or a related field at
the time of appointment. 

The position is available September 1, 2021 and will be based at the
Broad Branch Road campus of the Carnegie Institution for Science in
Washington, DC. Interested parties should send a cover letter,
curriculum vitae (including publications), statement of research
interests, and contact information for three references.

Contact Peter Driscoll (pdriscoll@carnegiescience.edu) for more
information.

PLANETARY ATLAS COLLECTION: A KICKSTARTER CAMPAIGN THAT PROMOTES SPACE
EXPLORATION FOR EVERYONE

Recent years have revealed an upward trend in volume, variety and
velocity of information coming from space, but where does that data end
up and how can we use it to inspire everyday people? A newly launched
Kickstarter Campaign seeks to drive an increase in space exploration
enthusiasm with their Planetary Atlas Collection of Earth's Moon,
Mercury and Mars. 

Brothers Eian and Tyler Ray, with their company RedMapper are the space
enthusiasts behind this campaign committed to bringing romance and
passion to planetary mapping with a pristine, modern aesthetic. The
newly launched campaign is focused on providing expert access of
planetary knowledge to everyday space enthusiasts. Each Atlas in the
Collection provides a comprehensive catalog of topographic features,
named places and human activities using modern mapping technology with
emerging data.

Each reward level consists of materials that promote space exploration
and make it possible for everyday space enthusiasts to explore the
inner Solar System on their own. Not everyone has to pledge to
participate, our online map portals can be accessed anonymously at no
cost, with no commitments at:
