EARLY CAREER PLANETARY LINKEDIN GROUP

A LinkedIn group has been created to promote opportunities for early 
career members of the planetary community, but members of the 
community from all career stages are encouraged to join. The LinkedIn 
group can be accessed here:

https://www.linkedin.com/groups/12570170/

For any early career members seeking jobs (MS/Ph.D. positions, 
postdocs, temporary/contractor, and permanent positions), you can add 
your information through this Google form:

https://bit.ly/3lsxLuG

The contents will then be added to this sheet where those seeking to 
hire early career community members can find potential candidates:

Anyone who wishes to be highlighted in the LinkedIn group after 
entering their information to the spreadsheet can opt-in through the 
Google form.

INTERNATIONAL ACADEMY OF ASTRONAUTICS STUDENT RESEARCH GRANTS

The Planetary Defense Conference Series of the International Academy 
of Astronautics (IAA) is establishing an international program to 
provide grants to mentor-led student teams or individuals on projects. 
Applications must be submitted in electronic form (PDF files) by 
November 30, 2021 to the email addresses specified in the Grant 
Overview document. Applicants will be notified of a decision by 
January 7, 2022. The Grant Overview document and other materials are 
available for download at:

OPPORTUNITIES FOR STUDENTS IN AGU PLANETARY SCIENCES SECTION

The AGU Planetary Sciences section is seeking applicants for our 
student and early career representative positions. These are 2 year 
positions that begin in January, though all incoming reps are invited 
to our Fall Meeting meeting prior to their start. Responsibilities 
include attending leadership meetings, organizing student activities 
at the AGU Fall Meeting, and leading new section initiatives that 
focus on support for student and early career members. Applications 
are due by October 15th and can be submitted here:

OPPORTUNITIES FOR AGU FALL MEETING CAREGIVER AWARDS

In an effort to make attendance at the 2021 Fall AGU meeting as widely 
accessible as possible, and to gauge the need of its members, the 
Planetary Sciences section wants to offer awards for caregivers (child 
or dependent) to support their Fall Meeting attendance. These monetary 
awards do not require in-person attendance. At this time, we cannot 
gauge the level of reimbursement we will be able to provide, or 
guarantee that all need will be met, but we will strive to support as 
many people as possible. Applications are kindly requested by October 
15th and are available here:

https://forms.gle/N3sb1VVmJ3EipsS46

We plan to notify recipients before the end of Early Bird registration.

JUPITER-GRAM AND REARCHITECTED VENUS-GRAM RELEASED IN GRAM V1.3

The Global Reference Atmospheric Model (GRAM) Suite is an engineering-
oriented atmospheric model that estimates mean values and statistical 
variations of atmospheric properties for planetary destinations. GRAM 
outputs include atmospheric density, temperature, pressure, winds, and 
chemical composition along a user-defined path. The GRAMs have been 
rearchitected from Fortran to a common object-oriented C++ framework. 
This new architecture creates a common GRAM library of data models and 
utilities. Version 1.3 of the GRAM Suite contains the new Jupiter-
GRAM and Uranus-GRAM and the rearchitected Neptune-GRAM, Titan-GRAM, 
and Venus-GRAM. Jupiter-GRAM atmospheric data is based on Galileo 
probe Atmospheric Structure Instrument (ASI) data. GRAM Suite Version 
1.3 contains improved methodology that computes the ratio of specific 
heats in run-time for the current constituent combination resulting in 
more accurate speed of sound calculations. GRAM Suite Version 1.3 also 
includes minor bug fixes to Version 1.2. GRAM Suite Version 1.3 is 
available upon request through the NASA Software Catalog at:

NASA SMALL BODIES ASSESSMENT GROUP EARLY CAREER OPPORTUNITIES

The upcoming NASA Small Bodies Assessment Group (SBAG) meeting will be 
held virtually on January 24-25, 2022. There will be multiple 
opportunities at this meeting specifically for the early career small 
body community including invited early-career speakers and lightning 
talks. Applications for invited talks are due via email by COB (5 pm 
Eastern Time) by November 19, 2021. Lightning talk submissions are due 
by COB (5 pm Eastern time) by December 17, 2021. Please refer to the

PARTICIPATE IN INTERNATIONAL OBSERVE THE MOON NIGHT ON OCTOBER 16TH

Saturday, October 16 is International Observe the Moon Night! You are 
invited to join observers around the world in sharing your excitement 
about lunar science and exploration, making celestial observations, 
and honoring cultural and personal connections to the Moon. This 
annual, worldwide public engagement event takes place when the Moon is 
close to first quarter - a great phase for evening observing.

You can participate in International Observe the Moon Night from 
wherever you are. Attend or host a virtual or in-person event, or join 
in as an individual observer. Tune in to the official broadcast on 
NASA TV and NASA social media, and share how you are participating 
using #ObserveTheMoon. However you choose to observe, please follow 
local guidelines on health and safety. 

Join the global conversation through our Facebook page: 

https://www.facebook.com/observethemoon/
 
Use #ObserveTheMoon on your preferred social media platform and visit 
the International Observe the Moon Night Flickr group:
