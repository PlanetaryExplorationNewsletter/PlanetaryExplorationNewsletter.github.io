NSF: GEOSCIENCE LESSONS FOR AND FROM OTHER WORLDS (GLOW)

NSF's Divisions of Earth Sciences (EAR), Atmospheric and Geospace Sciences (AGS), and Astronomical Sciences (AST) encourage the submission of proposals that bring together researchers and experts to develop projects which: 1) use the study of other worlds as a way to broaden and deepen our understanding of the Earth and its evolution, including all processes and systems from the core to the magnetosphere, and/or 2) use our geoscience knowledge to understand the environments of other worlds. Science drivers include but are not limited to:

- What can the study of other worlds reveal about the first billion 
  years of Earth history?
- What can the study of other worlds reveal about Earth's past and its 
  future climate?
- What can the study of other worlds reveal about interactions between 
  the Earth and space environment?
- What can the study of Earth's systems reveal about environments and 
  processes that shape other worlds?
- How can our basic science understanding of Earth processes and 
  systems guide the identification of other habitable worlds?

POSTDOCTORAL RESEARCHER AT CU BOULDER/LASP

The Exploration of Planetary Ices and Climates (EPIC) group at the 
University of Colorado's Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics 
(LASP) seeks a postdoctoral researcher (RS-I, i.e., within ~3 years of 
Ph.D.) in planetary science. Research in the EPIC group encompasses 
theoretical and observational studies of the surfaces and atmospheres 
of planets, natural satellites, and small bodies. The successful 
candidate will collaborate with EPIC group members on currently funded 
projects and seek to develop an independent research program. A focus 
of this position will include investigations using data from NASA's 
Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter and the Dawn at Ceres mission to address 
fundamental questions about ice on airless bodies.

For further information and to apply, see the link below or contact 
Dr. Paul Hayne (paul.hayne@colorado.edu) or Dr. Margaret Landis 
(margaret.landis@colorado.edu).

ABSCICON 2022 SESSION: SALTY GOODNESS II - RETURN OF THE BRINES (IN 
MEMORIAM OF RONALD OREMLAND)

Abstract Submission deadline January 19th, 2022.

https://agu.confex.com/agu/abscicon21/prelim.cgi/Session/112203

Hypersaline systems prove to be some of the most challenging 
environments for microorganisms to reside in, where biology must
 overcome extreme osmotic stresses, low water activities, and 
chaotropicity, among others. Despite these stressors, hypersaline 
environments on Earth host an astounding diversity of micro- and 
macro-organisms. Beyond Earth, these environments remain some of the 
most compelling for extant life detection (i.e. Europa and Enceladus), 
or represent the last vestiges of a potentially habitable environment 
on early Mars, characterized now by extensive evaporitic deposits. In 
Salty Goodness I, we hosted discussions centered on habitability - this 
year we concentrate on the biology, encouraging abstracts focused on: 

1) expanding upon the biological effects of chaotropic fluids, 
2) the microbial ecology of, and adaptations to, extreme hypersaline 
   systems, 
3) methodologies for biological investigations of brines, 
4) ecological modeling utilizing quantified habitability metrics, and 
5) laboratory-based biological experiments conducted under relevant 
   Solar System body conditions.

ABSCICON 2022 SESSION: CROSSING THE THRESHOLD - IN SITU INSTRUMENTATION 
TO SEEK LIFE, ITS PRECURSORS, AND GEOPHYSICAL CONTEXT ON EUROPA AND 
OTHER OCEAN WORLDS

Please submit your abstracts here:

https://agu.confex.com/agu/abscicon21/prelim.cgi/Session/112403

Submission deadline: January 19

Recent missions have revealed a host of potentially habitable 
environments on Ocean Worlds. The next step in the search for signs of 
life, complex abiotic organic chemistry, and habitability will be to 
perform landed investigations with access to the near-subsurface. 
Astrobiologically-relevant materials including organics may be present 
on these worlds at very low concentrations, driving the need for 
specialized sample handling, enrichment and preparation techniques, 
and/or extreme instrument measurement sensitivity. Missions will also 
perform critical geophysical and geochemical investigations of the 
moons' internal structures and composition, and conduct ground truth 
observations to verify remote sensing observations. Additional 
challenges are strict planetary protection constraints, limited 
communication intervals, and operation in harsh environments with 
stringent mass, power, and volume limits.

This session seeks to highlight measurement requirements, laboratory 
techniques, and instruments and technologies under development to 
address these challenges and enable detection/characterization of 
biosignatures, geophysical context, and habitability on Ocean Worlds.

ABSCICON 2022 SESSION: CHEMOMETRIC, CHEMOINFORMATIC, AND MACHINE 
LEARNING STRATEGIES TO CHARACTERIZE COMPLEX ORGANIC AND INORGANIC 
MIXTURES

We are inviting abstracts that apply machine learning and/or building 
databases to facilitate the characterization of complex 
organic/inorganic mixtures.

https://agu.confex.com/agu/abscicon21/prelim.cgi/Session/112057

Astrobiological studies of complex samples often target specific 
analytes such as compounds used in contemporary biochemistry. As a 
result, the majority of other analytes (which often constitute the 
majority of the sample) remain unstudied. Thus, deep understanding of 
the extent to which abiotic processes and geochemical conditions drive 
(geo)chemical complexity is not fully realized. Such understanding may 
be critical for work aimed at deciphering geologic history, 
elucidating conditions conducive for abiogenesis, and detecting 
biosignatures. This session will highlight chemometric techniques 
used to characterize complex organic and/or inorganic mixtures such as 
those generated from laboratory simulations (e.g., Miller-Urey 
reactions, tholins/astrophysical ice analogs) or within 
(astro-)geological materials, including meteorites, Archean rocks, and 
planetary samples. Examples of relevant topics include investigations 
incorporating multivariate techniques and machine learning tools 
(including supervised, unsupervised, and deep learning-based 
approaches). Work aimed towards generating databases useful to the 
chemometrics/astrobiology community are also welcomed.

Abstract Deadline: January 19, 2022, at 23:59 EDT/03:59 +1 GMT.

ABSCICON 2022 SESSION: PREBIOTIC/ABIOTIC CHEMISTRY IN ALTERNATIVE 
SOLVENTS

Please consider applying to our session on prebiotic/abiotic chemistry 
in alternative solvents or solvents with very low water activity.

https://agu.confex.com/agu/abscicon21/prelim.cgi/Session/111829

While much of prebiotic chemistry is focused on reactions systems in 
water, as that is the primary solvent on Earth, other solvent systems 
may be possible and some have been argued to be potentially more 
conducive to origin of life (e.g. formamide). Examples where other 
solvents are available on a sufficient scale include Titan, exoplanets, 
and locations with low water activity. This session invites abstracts 
to showcase the current state of knowledge in this area, including 
laboratory and modelling studies on the potential for abiotic chemistry 
under these conditions that may represent the first steps towards 
biological processes.

AUBURN GRADUATE PROGRAMS IN PLANETARY SCIENCE AND AEROSPACE ENGINEERING

The Departments of Aerospace Engineering and Geosciences at Auburn 
University in Auburn, Alabama, invite graduate student applications 
pursuing Ph.D. degrees to research programs that interdisciplinarily 
explore Astrodynamics and Planetary Science. Outstanding applicants who 
have strong and broad interests in exploring space systems/planetary 
body mechanics and geology using multi-physics modeling and data 
processing are encouraged to apply. The programs offer graduate 
students unique opportunities to bridge planetary science research and 
aerospace engineering technology development. There are two ways to 
join the above programs. The Aerospace Engineering Department offers a 
Ph.D. program for graduate students to pursue astrodynamics education,
