CALL FOR PAPERS FOR SPECIAL COLLECTION ON PLANETARY CAVES

Call for Papers: "Exploring Planetary Caves as Windows into Subsurface 
Geology, Habitability, and Astrobiology"

Submission Deadline: November 30, 2021

This special collection, which focuses on the current state of 
planetary cave science, including: 1) how we identify and characterize 
planetary caves, 2) which processes are behind their genesis and what 
we can learn from terrestrial analogs, 3) the potential for planetary 
caves as habitats for life, and 4) how we may explore these windows 
into the subsurface.
 
This special collection welcomes recent advances in geology, 
geophysics, astrobiology, and environmental science regarding 
planetary caves. This knowledge will be the baseline for future space 
missions and will help the community to set scientific goals and 
technological solutions for the exploration of planetary caves.
 
Manuscripts should be submitted through the GEMS website for Earth and 
Space Science or JGR-Planets by selecting the collection title from 
the Special Section drop-down menu on the submission portal.

POST-DOCTORAL POSITION IN ISOTOPE GEOCHEMISTRY

Bavarian Geoinstitute for Experimental Geochemistry and Geophysics 
(BGI), University of Bayreuth, Germany

The BGI, University of Bayreuth, Germany, is seeking a candidate for a 
post-doctoral position to investigate potassium isotope fractionation 
during Solar System formation. The candidate will develop potassium 
isotope analysis by double-spiked thermal ionisation mass spectrometry 
(TIMS) in tandem with development of measurement by collision cell 
MC-ICPMS and apply these methods to the analysis of various meteorites,
terrestrial rocks and experimental samples. 

The position is part of a project that seeks to quantify the role of 
vapour loss during planet formation and is funded by European Research 
Council Starting Grant Vaploss. As such, the candidate will become 
part of a team of two post-doctoral researchers who will work jointly
with the PI (Dr. Remco Hin) on the project in a research institute 
with a long-standing interest in Earth and planetary sciences.

The position is funded for 3 years. The salary will be based on grade 
E13 TV-L of the pay scale for the German public sector.

Applications are being received until the position is filled. For more 
details, please visit the homepage of the BGI:

POST-DOCTORAL POSITION IN GEOPHYSICS/PLANETARY PHYSICS

Bavarian Geoinstitute for Experimental Geochemistry and Geophysics
(BGI), University of Bayreuth, Germany

The BGI, University of Bayreuth, Germany, is seeking a candidate for a 
post-doctoral position to numerically model volatile loss processes 
occurring during planetary growth. The work will focus on describing 
the formation of vapour above magma and escape of this vapour from the 
gravitational influence of growing planetary objects, and integrating
chemical fractionation during these processes.

The position is part of a project that seeks to quantify the role of 
volatile loss during planetary growth and is funded by European 
Research Council Starting Grant Vaploss. As such, the candidate will 
become part of a team of two post-doctoral researchers who will work 
jointly with the PI (Dr. Remco Hin) on the project in a research 
institute with a long-standing interest in Earth and planetary 
sciences.

The position is funded for 2 years. The salary will be based on grade 
E13 TV-L of the pay scale for the German public sector.

TWO GEOLOGIST POSITIONS, SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION 

The Smithsonian Institution, National Air and Space Museum (NASM), 
Center for Earth and Planetary Studies (CEPS) welcomes applications for 
two federal, full-time, permanent geologist positions. CEPS carries out 
cutting-edge research on the geology and geophysics of planets and 
moons across the Solar System, develops novel methods for remote 
sensing, mentors the next generation of scientists, and shares the 
excitement of planetary exploration with museum visitors. CEPS 
participates in planetary missions to rocky and icy planetary bodies, 
analyzes data returned by these missions, and studies planetary analog 
features in the field. 

The incumbent conducts scientific research in planetary and terrestrial 
geology, geophysics, and remote sensing with emphasis on data analysis 
and synthesis. Major duties include proposing to external sources for 
funding, scientific research and analysis leading to peer-reviewed 
publications that significantly advance the incumbent's field of study, 
presentation of results in professional conferences, and active public 
outreach in the fields of Earth and planetary science. The positions 
close on Monday, June 28, 2021.

LUNAR AND PLANETARY LAB CONFERENCE (LPLC)

The organizing committee is happy to announce that the Lunar and 
Planetary Lab Conference (LPLC) will be happening again this year. Last 
year, we had a great turnout with the virtual conference and 
pre-recorded talks. This year, we hope to kick off the new semester 
with LPLC in person on Friday, August 20, 2021.

We will do our best to follow whatever guidelines the university puts 
forth for the Fall semester and we plan to have methods in place for 
social distancing during the conference. Due to the unique 
circumstances for this year, we would like to get a headcount of the 
number of participants we can expect through a registration process. 
All participants, whether presenting or not, will need to fill out the 
registration form. Another form will be sent out later in the summer to 
those who have registered in order to get abstracts for presentations. 
We will provide more information about the conference format and plans 
once we have an idea of the number of participants. 
 
The registration form will be open until July 18 and can be found at:

https://www.lpl.arizona.edu/LPLC
