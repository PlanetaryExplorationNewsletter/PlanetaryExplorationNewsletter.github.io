OPPORTUNITIES FOR AGU FALL MEETING CONFERENCE REGISTRATION 
REIMBURSEMENT

To make the 2021 AGU Fall Meeting as widely accessible as possible, and 
to gauge community need, the Planetary Sciences Section of AGU wants to 
offer partial or full reimbursement of registration costs to those for 
whom registration expenses present a barrier to attendance. At this 
time, we cannot gauge the level of reimbursement we will be able to 
provide, or guarantee that all need will be met, and we are, 
unfortunately, unable to waive registration fees in advance. 
Applications can be completed through this Google form at:

https://bit.ly/3fgRE4J

Please submit by August 31.

[NASA] PDS: INSIGHT FIRST RELEASE OF HP3 DATA

The NASA Planetary Data System announces the first release of data from 
the InSight Heat Flow and Physical Properties Package (HP3) instrument. 
This release contains covers two thermal conductivity measurements 
conducted using the TEM-A sensor suite. Measurements were performed at 
a mole tip depth of 0.37 m after the mole was fully buried in the soil 
and cover the depth range between 0.03 and 0.37 m. Released ancillary 
data obtained during mole hammering provide the mole tilt with respect 
to local gravity during these measurements.

The data may be accessed from:

https://pds-geosciences.wustl.edu/missions/insight/

InSight releases occur every three months. The next release is 
scheduled for October 1, 2021.

TENURE TRACK FACULTY POSITION IN PLANETARY SCIENCE AT BROWN UNIVERSITY

The Department of Earth, Environmental and Planetary Sciences at Brown 
University invites applications for a tenure-track faculty position in 
Planetary Science. Ideal candidates are those working on fundamental 
processes applicable across multiple Solar System bodies and who would 
broaden and enhance existing departmental strengths in climate and 
environmental science, geochemistry, geophysics, planetary materials, 
or remote sensing. We encourage candidates from all fields of planetary 
science to apply.

The successful candidate will be expected to maintain an active, 
externally-funded research program, enjoy a commitment to teaching at 
both undergraduate and graduate levels, and contribute to the academic 
community of the department and university including efforts to 
promote diversity, equity, and inclusion. Women, members of 
historically underrepresented groups, and individuals with 
disabilities are particularly encouraged to apply. Appointment is 
expected at the Assistant Professor level, although exceptional 
circumstances could warrant appointment at a higher level. The position 
will remain open until filled, but review of applications will begin 
October 1, 2021, with an anticipated start date of July 1, 2022. For 
further information about how to apply, please visit: 

http://apply.interfolio.com/90367

You may also contact the search committee chair Professor Ralph 
Milliken (Ralph_Milliken@brown.edu).

CALL FOR APPLICATIONS TO THE MEASUREMENTS DEFINITION TEAM FOR 
INTERNATIONAL MARS ICE MAPPER

On July 26, NASA and the Canadian, Italian, and Japanese space agencies 
released a Call for Applications for Membership on the Joint 
ASI/CSA/JAXA/NASA Measurement Definition Team for the International 
Mars Ice Mapper Mission (I-MIM). I-MIM would map and characterize 
accessible (within the uppermost 10 m) subsurface water ice and its 
overburden in mid-to-low latitudes to support planning for potential i
human surface missions to Mars. This (unfunded) opportunity is open to 
scientists, engineers, and other qualified and interested individuals 
from institutions worldwide. For reasons of cost, time, and safety, 
most of the MDT's work will be carried out using email and tele/video 
conferences. The full text of this call and all associated 
documentation and application materials can be found at:   

https://go.nasa.gov/imim_mdt    

Applications are due August 23, 2021.

PHYSICAL SCIENCES LUNAR SURFACE SCIENCE WORKSHOP AGENDA NOW AVAILABLE

The NASA Biological and Physical Sciences Division is hosting a 
workshop on fundamental and applied research on the Moon in physical 
sciences on August 18-19, 2021.

This workshop will bring together the science community, commercial 
companies, and NASA Divisions and Programs with the goals of discussing 
investigations on reduced gravity and lunar environmental effects in 
physical sciences research for sustained lunar human habitation and in 
preparation for human exploration to Mars and to inform and inspire the 
science community to contribute white papers for the Biological and 
Physical Sciences Decadal Survey.

The workshop agenda has been posted at: 

https://www.hou.usra.edu/meetings/lunarsurface2020/ 

Registration is free, but required by August 13.

Workshop presentations and posters will concern reduced gravity and 
environmental effects of the Moon on physical systems, including:

- Lunar dust and its properties, behavior, and mitigation
- Life support and thermal management
- Materials flammability and habitat fire safety
- Extraction of water-ice from regolith research, including separation, 
- purification, electrolysis, and liquefaction
- Lunar environment and its effects on materials
- Lunar research in extraction, processing, and handling
- Lunar research for advanced manufacturing
- Fundamental physics research on the lunar surface

In this newsletter, we continue to update the upcoming conference 
schedule with postponements, cancellations, and conversions to virtual 
meetings.

We hope everyone remains safe and healthy within these stressful, 
rapidly evolving, social-isolating times.

MERCURY'S SURFACE RESPONSE TO THE INTERPLANETARY ENVIRONMENT:
IDENTIFYING NEEDED STUDIES IN LABORATORY ASTROPHYSICS

Date: January 24-27, 2022
Location: Virtual

Mercury is a complex system of interconnected parts: magnetosphere,
exosphere, and surface. How Mercury responds to its interplanetary
environment is equally complex. Models help us understand how solar 
wind and micrometeorites modify Mercury’s surface spectral, mineral, 
and chemical properties and produce the planet’s exosphere. The 
reliability of these models hinges on accurately understanding the 
underlying physical processes responsible for the observed properties.

This workshop will focus on identifying those processes whose
uncertainties hinder our ability to reliably model Mercury’s response 
to the interplanetary environment. We will discuss the laboratory
astrophysics studies, theoretical and experimental, most needed to
advance our understanding of Mercury’s system.

The workshop will produce several reports to guide scientific efforts
for supporting analysis of BepiColombo data and future missions. It 
will examine the limitations of current planetary models that build on 
the underlying laboratory astrophysics data. It will outline the status 
of laboratory astrophysics studies and what experimental and 
theoretical work is needed to fully address these limitations.

A modest registration fee to be determined will be requested.
