[NASA] INPUT TO NASA'S RFI IN SUPPORT OF ADVANCING EQUITY AND SUPPORT 
FOR UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES

As you may be aware, NASA issued a Request for Information on June 15,
2021 and held a public meeting on July 13, 2021 to obtain input and
suggestions from the public on how we might consider changing (e.g.
expanding, streamlining, updating, etc.) our programs, procurements,
grants, regulations and policies to remove systemic inequitable
barriers and challenges facing underserved communities. 

https://tinyurl.com/ysevwaas

The public comment period closes on August 31, 2021. We solicit input 
and suggestions on actionable steps we can take, specifically on the
following questions: 

1) What challenges, issues, or obstacles have been encountered with the
scientific competition and award implementation processes, especially
the challenges, issues, or obstacles that impact underserved
communities?

2) What opportunities are there for NASA to leverage its data,
expertise, and missions to better serve and help underserved
communities?

You are encouraged to submit your formal RFI reply via the link
provided above. You can also send your response to the questions via
email to Karen Flynn, SMD's Deputy Associate Administrator for
Management (karen.e.flynn@nasa.gov) by August 31, 2021. We look forward
to hearing from you.

FREE SEMINAR ON ADDRESSING CONTROVERSIAL TOPICS

Planetary Scientists are invited to join this discussion on ways to
address controversial topics during public engagement programs.

Sharing Planetary Science: Addressing Controversial Topics
Tuesday, August 17 3:00 PM CDT

All planetary scientists and engineers, including early career
scientists and graduate students, are invited to join us for this free 
seminar, to discuss ways to address controversial topics during public 
engagement programs.

OPPORTUNITIES FOR AGU FALL MEETING CONFERENCE REGISTRATION 
REIMBURSEMENT

To make the 2021 AGU Fall Meeting as widely accessible as possible, and
to gauge community need, the Planetary Sciences Section of AGU wants to
offer partial or full reimbursement of registration costs to those for
whom registration expenses present a barrier to attendance. At this
time, we cannot gauge the level of reimbursement we will be able to
provide, or guarantee that all need will be met, and we are,
unfortunately, unable to waive registration fees in advance.
Applications can be completed by August 31 through this Google form:

TENURE TRACK FACULTY POSITION IN EARTH, ENVIRONMENTAL AND PLANETARY 
SCIENCES AT RICE UNIVERSITY

The Department of Earth, Environmental, and Planetary Sciences at Rice
University seeks candidates across the broad spectrum of planetary and
environmental sciences, areas where the department anticipates growth,
and who complement our department. Some of the research areas of
interest include, but are not limited to: surface processes, climate
and all related sciences; astrobiology, planetary habitability of the
solar system and beyond using observational approaches such as
cosmochemistry and remote sensing and modeling.

We particularly welcome applications from individuals with a
demonstrated commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion.

Successful candidates are expected to establish a vigorous, externally
funded research program, teach core courses and develop undergraduate
and graduate courses within their area of expertise, and be involved in
service to the department, university, and the broader scientific
community.

All candidates must have earned a Ph.D. degree in Earth, Environmental,
or Planetary Sciences or a related field by the time of the
appointment.

NASA POSTDOCTORAL FELLOWSHIP - APPLICATION DEADLINE NOVEMBER 1, 2021

The NASA Postdoctoral Program (NPP) offers US and international scientists
the opportunity to advance their research while contributing to NASA's
scientific goals. The NPP supports fundamental science; explores the
undiscovered; promotes intellectual growth; and encourages scientific
connections.

Selected by a competitive peer-review process, NPP Fellows complete
one- to three-year Fellowship appointments that advance NASA's missions
in earth science, heliophysics, planetary science, astrophysics, space
bioscience, aeronautics and engineering, human exploration and space
operations, and astrobiology.

Current NPP research opportunities in planetary science can be viewed
here: NPP Planetary Science Research Opportunities

Applicants must have a Ph.D. or equivalent degree in hand before
beginning the fellowship, but may apply while completing the degree
requirements. Please see current eligibility requirements.

Stipends start at $60,000 per year, with supplements for high
cost-of-living areas and for certain academic specialties. Financial
assistance is available for relocation and health insurance, and
$10,000 per year is provided for professional travel.

Applications are accepted three times each year: March 1, July 1, and
November 1.
