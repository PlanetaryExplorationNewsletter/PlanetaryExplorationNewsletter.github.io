COMMITTEE ON SPACE RESEARCH (COSPAR): NEW PANEL ON SOCIAL SCIENCES AND
HUMANITIES

COSPAR, the Committee on Space Research, has created in June 2021 a
Panel on Social Sciences and Humanities (PSSH), aimed at giving itself
a role commensurate with the current challenges of space activities, in
terms of their interaction with society at large, and gaining increased
visibility outside the regular space science community.

A second, equally important objective, is to offer space activities as
one subject of interest and research to social science and humanities
scholars and practitioners, with the aim of better understanding the
perception of space activities by society, and of highlighting the
corresponding stakes relating to these activities.

One goal of the panel PSSH will be to use the unchallenged scientific
competence of COSPAR to build awareness of the current and future
challenges of space activities, for instance through the analysis of
the impacts of space exploration and use of space assets in the
development and running of society, in a context where there is growing
interdependence of human societies on Earth.

VENERA-D: VENUS CLOUD HABITABILITY SYSTEM WORKSHOP

We are happy to announce the Venera-D: Venus Cloud Habitability System
Workshop scheduled for November 30 - December 3, 2021. This workshop 
will be delivered as a hybrid meeting, with in-person attendance at the
Space Research Institute (IKI) in Moscow, Russia, and virtually for a
remote audience.

The purpose of this workshop is to discuss the formation and stability
of Venus clouds over time and their role in potential habitability.
This workshop will discuss what is understood about past and present
habitability, the best measurements and methods needed to address these
questions, and how future missions will contribute to understanding the
cloud habitability system.

We welcome all abstracts with a focus on any one of these four topics:
1) cloud layer habitability, 2) inputs (interior, surface, exogenous)
to and outputs from the cloud layer over time, 3) measurements and
instruments necessary to investigate the Venus cloud region, and 4)
open questions or any additional investigations pertaining to the
habitability of Venus clouds.

For more information: 

https://www.hou.usra.edu/meetings/venera_d2021/

Notice of interest is due by August 11, 2021.

GAC-MAC 2021 HYBRID MEETING - CALL FOR ABSTRACTS

Are you tired of attending virtual-only meetings? Come to the
Geological Association of Canada and Mineralogical Association of
Canada Joint Annual Meeting GAC-MAC 2021 this fall in London, Ontario,
Canada (November 1-5, 2021) where we will hold a hybrid in-person and
virtual meeting on the beautiful campus at Western University! 

We welcome abstract submissions (deadline July 12, 2021) for the full
proposed Scientific Program, including sessions of Planetary Science
and Exploration interest, which can be found at:

https://gacmac2021.ca/registration-abstracts/ 

GAC-MAC 2021 will be a hybrid blend, with a live virtual scientific
program (Nov 1 and 3-5, 2021) along with a return to the traditional
3-day Joint Annual meeting format (Nov 3-5, 2021). Submit an abstract,
choose your in-person or virtual method of presentation, and join us
this fall in London at Western University or online!  

Looking forward, after this long break, to seeing you there!

AGU SESSION SM019: MAGNETOSPHERES IN THE INNER SOLAR SYSTEM

The structure and dynamics of each planetary magnetosphere in the inner
Solar System are driven by a unique set of factors including the nature
of its magnetization, atmosphere-ionosphere coupling, and local solar
wind parameters. This session welcomes submissions on the intrinsic
magnetospheres of Mercury and Earth as well as the induced
magnetospheres of Venus and Mars to provide a forum for discussion of
recent data analysis and modeling efforts, including those related to
BepiColombo, Solar Orbiter, and Parker Solar Probe flybys. The session
will focus on general magnetospheric processes including, but not
limited to: solar wind-magnetosphere interactions,
magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling, plasma acceleration and transport,
magnetic reconnection, wave instabilities, magnetotail dynamics, and
bow shock physics. We strongly encourage comparative studies of these
inner Solar System magnetospheres with each other or with other
planetary magnetospheres throughout the Solar System.

The deadline for all submissions is Wednesday, 4 August 2021 at 23:59
EDT. Abstracts will not be accepted for review after this date.

AGU SESSION SM023: MOON-PLASMA INTERACTIONS THROUGHOUT THE SOLAR SYSTEM

This session focuses on observational and theoretical studies of the
interaction between the moons of our Solar System and the magnetized
plasmas incident upon them. This includes plasma interactions with the
solid surfaces, atmospheres, dust environments, and intrinsic/induced
magnetic fields of the moons, both inside and outside of their parent
planets' magnetospheres. Of special interest are results related to
in-situ field and particle measurements near Earth's Moon and from
Cassini's flybys of Saturn's icy satellites Enceladus, Rhea and Dione.
Studies deepening our understanding of the interconnection between
Titan's ionosphere and its highly dynamic magnetospheric environment
are also very welcome. The interaction of Jupiter's moons with the
ambient magnetospheric plasma will be addressed with a view to provide
support to the ongoing Juno Mission and the planning of synergistic
measurements for the upcoming JUICE and Europa Clipper missions.
Comparative studies of the various moon-plasma interaction scenarios
are particularly welcome.

This session is Co-Organized with Planetary Sciences.

GSA SESSION: PLANETARY SCIENCE EDUCATION

Interested in planetary science and education? Have a cool teaching
example you'd like to highlight? Please consider submitting an abstract
to T118. "Planetary Science Education: Strategies, Examples, and Best
Practices for Teaching Astrogeology-Related Topics" at the fall GSA
meeting in Portland, OR. This session will explore approaches used to
teach planetary science to students at the K-12, college, and graduate
levels. Approaches to successfully integrating all student levels into
research will also be addressed, as will topics related to engaging the
public. To submit an abstract to this session or to check out all of
