IN MEMORIAM: JOHN HOFFMAN

It is with great sadness that we announce the passing of Dr. John 
Hoffman at the age of 91. John was a wonderful colleague, mentor, and 
scientist who contributed tremendously to the field of space research 
and education. He was always willing to give of his time and expertise 
and quick to adopt technical problems and contribute in national and 
international collaborations. He will be sorely missed. 

John developed instruments for the Apollos 15, 16, and 17 lunar 
missions, the latter being part of the ALSEP surface package. He also 
flew mass spectrometers on the earth orbiting satellites, Explorer 31, 
ISIS-II, AE-C, D, and E, and Wake Shield, plus numerous sounding 
rockets and stratospheric balloon flights. The first observations of 
the polar wind, ions flowing out from the atmosphere, were made by his 
ion mass spectrometer flown on the ISIS spacecraft in 1971. In 1978, 
his instrument flew on the Pioneer Venus mission to Venus where data 
was received throughout the descent of the probe to the surface.

[NASA] PDS: MARS RECONNAISSANCE ORBITER DATA RELEASE 56

The NASA Planetary Data System announces Release 56 of data from the 
Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO). This release contains raw, 
calibrated, and derived data products nominally covering the time 
period May 9, 2020, through August 8, 2020. Some instrument teams are 
delivering more recent data. The data are archived at various PDS 
nodes.

CRISM, SHARAD, and Radio Science data are archived at the Geosciences 
Node. HiRISE, CTX, and MARCI data are archived at the Cartography and 
Imaging Sciences Node. MCS data are archived at the Atmospheres Node.
SPICE data are archived at the NAIF Node

No new Radio Science data will be produced.

The data may be accessed at

https://pds-geosciences.wustl.edu/missions/mro/

[NASA] PDS: MRO CRISM MTRDR AND TER RELEASE 16

PDS announces Release 16 of Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter CRISM Targeted 
Empirical Data Record (TER) and Map-projected Targeted Reduced Data 
Record (MTRDR) products, at:

https://pds-geosciences.wustl.edu/missions/mro/crism.htm

This release fills in data from August 9 through December 25, 2008.

TER products are image cubes derived from CRISM hyperspectral targeted 
observations, post-processed to standardize the illumination and 
observation geometry and remove atmospheric gas absorptions and 
instrument artifacts. MTRDRs are the same products map-projected using 
terrain models of the Martian surface.

[NASA] PDS: IMPORTANT NOTICE FOR DATA USERS

PDS is making a change to its standards, which may impact users of PDS 
data, especially if you have written custom scripts/software to read 
data. This change to allowed line feed markers was previously posted 
here with a request for input, and PDS is moving forward after 
receiving positive feedback.

This change is scheduled to go into effect June 2021 with IM version 
1.16.0.0.

The current PDS standard requires that each line in ASCII table data 
and most text files ends with Carriage Return (CR) and Line Feed (LF) 
characters, the standard format for Windows. The change being 
implemented would additionally allow a second format used by Linux and 
MacOS systems in which every line ends with a Line Feed character (LF) 
alone.

Most software applications can accommodate either format, regardless of 
the operating system. However, this change could affect some end users, 
especially those who have written software based on the current PDS 
standard. The line delimiter will continue to be specified in the PDS4 
label accompanying such data files. PDS3 products and labels are 
unchanged.

More details, and guidance for updating your tools, can be found at: 

https://sbn.psi.edu/line-feed-notice

[NASA] PDS: R&A PROPOSAL SUPPORT WEBPAGES

NASA's Planetary Data System (PDS) announces new web pages designed to 
provide a comprehensive set of resources for R&A proposers who are 
considering archiving their data in the PDS: 

https://pds.nasa.gov/home/proposers/ 

These pages cover the how and why of archiving in the PDS, from 
requesting letters of support for proposals to the entire archiving 
process. Proposers are encouraged to consult these pages as a first 
stop for seeking information about data archiving, followed by making 
contact with the relevant PDS node(s). We welcome your input on the 
usability of this new resource for the planetary community; please send 
all feedback to Nancy Chanover (nchanove@nmsu.edu).

UREY FELLOW POSITION AT THE LUNAR AND PLANETARY INSTITUTE

The Lunar and Planetary Institute, managed for NASA by the Universities 
Space Research Association, is seeking a senior postdoctoral scholar 
for its prestigious Urey Fellowship. This fellowship recognizes and 
promotes excellence in planetary science research for scientists who 
are at least two years past their doctorate and have a strong 
publication record.

2021 INTERNATIONAL SUMMER SCHOOL IN ASTROBIOLOGY: SEARCHING FOR LIFE ON 
MARS

The 2021 International Summer School in Astrobiology will review and 
assess the types of techniques that are necessary for detection of 
biosignatures on Mars, including Raman spectroscopy, the isotopic and 
chirality analyses that Rosalind Franklin rover will perform, and the 
advanced techniques needed to analyze samples both in-situ and in 
Earth-based laboratories.

The central question will be "how can we unequivocally detect 
biosignatures on Mars?" and the discussions will involve in-situ 
rovers, sample collecting and return, laboratory analyses on Earth, and 
the experiments that future human explorers may be able to perform. The 
lectures will be focused on instrumentation and techniques.

In addition to lectures, during the week the students will participate 
in discussions about the theme, prepare and present group projects, and 
take part in an excursion to a relevant astrobiological site near 
Santander.

Summer School Dates: Monday, September 6, through Friday, September 10, 
2021, contingent on travel approval.
