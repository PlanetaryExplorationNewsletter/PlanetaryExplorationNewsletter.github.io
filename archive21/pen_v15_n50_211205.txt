MERCURY SCIENCE AND EXPLORATION NOVEMBER 2021 NEWSLETTER RELEASED

The Mercury Exploration Assessment Group (MExAG) is circulating Issue 5 
of "The Mercury Newsletter". The quarterly community newsletter can be 
accessed online at:

https://www.lpi.usra.edu/mexag/newsletter/

In this newsletter, we share Mercury science and exploration news, 
highlight recent publications, and note upcoming meetings.

RE-ARCHITECTED MARS-GRAM AND EARTH-GRAM RELEASED IN GRAM SUITE 
VERSION 1.4

The Global Reference Atmospheric Model (GRAM) Suite is an 
engineering-oriented atmospheric model that estimates mean values and 
statistical variations of atmospheric properties for planetary 
destinations. GRAM outputs include atmospheric density, temperature, 
pressure, winds, and chemical composition along a user-defined path. 
The GRAMs have been re-architected from Fortran to a common 
object-oriented C++ framework. This new architecture creates a common 
GRAM library of data models and utilities. Version 1.4 of the GRAM 
Suite contains the re-architected Mars-GRAM, Earth-GRAM, Neptune-GRAM, 
Titan-GRAM, and Venus-GRAM and the new Uranus-GRAM and Jupiter-GRAM.  
GRAM Suite Version 1.4 also now includes the 2019 Range Reference 
Atmosphere database in Earth-GRAM. GRAM Suite Version 1.4 is available 
upon request through the NASA Software Catalog at: 

https://software.nasa.gov/software/MFS-33888-1

SHARING PLANETARY SCIENCE SEMINAR COMMON PLANETARY MISCONCEPTIONS

Tuesday, December 7, 3:00 p.m. CST

All planetary scientists and engineers, including early-career 
scientists and graduate students, are invited to join us on December 7, 
2021 for this free seminar. Audiences may have mistaken ideas about the 
size, scale, and characteristics of objects in the Solar System, and 
limited understanding of astronomical and geological time and concepts. 
Join Dr. Sanlyn Buxner (Planetary Science Institute), Dr. Molly Simon 
(Arizona State University) and Christine Shupla (LPI) to learn about 
how people learn and some of the common planetary misconceptions that 
may affect education and public engagement programs, and to discuss 
ways to modify your presentations and activities.

ABSCICON 2022 SESSION: DEEP DIVE INTO THE GEOPHYSICS OF OCEAN WORLDS

Submit your oral and poster presentations to the Ocean World focused 
AbSciCon 2022 session Deep Dive into the Geophysics of Ocean Worlds. 
Details: 

https://agu.confex.com/agu/abscicon21/prelim.cgi/Session/111831 

Submission deadline: January 19

A variety of planetary oceans are predicted in our Solar System and 
beyond, whose conditions depend on planetary size, water mass, 
composition, stellar distance, etc. Although regarded as major 
astrobiological targets, physical constraints are necessary to 
understand the limiting factors for habitability. P-T conditions in 
these oceans can exceed those found on Earth, therefore approaches 
using geophysical tools to constrain planetary environments becomes 
binding.

We welcome contributions from numerical and experimental studies 
using geophysical tools (e.g. geodynamics, mineral physics, 
thermodynamics, seismology) aimed at understanding the environments 
of ocean-bearing worlds from their surfaces to their deep interiors, 
with topics including: 

(1) numerical studies of structure/geodynamics, 
(2) experimental studies of aqueous solutions and solids (ices, rocks, 
    metals), 
(3) exploration with upcoming mission concepts (e.g. gravity, 
    seismology, magnetism), including fieldwork, and 
(4) investigating the astrobiology of ocean worlds with geophysics.

Looking forward to your submissions!

The conveners,

Baptiste Journaux, Angela Marusiak, Cayman Unterborn, Morgan Cable, 
Mohit Melwani Daswani, Shannon MacKenzie, Nadejda Marounina, 
Steve Vance
