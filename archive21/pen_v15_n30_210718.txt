POSTDOCTORAL POSITION WITHIN DATA PROCESSING AND VISUALIZATION OF 
EISCAT3D DATA, UMEA UNIVERSITY, SWEDEN

The employment is full-time for two years starting September 15, 2021 
or by agreement.

In the research project data from EISCAT3D will be used. EISCAT3D 
collects atmospheric and ionospheric data using Incoherent Scatter 
Radar (ISR) techniques and provides information about the complex 
systems in the atmosphere and the interaction between the Sun and the 
Earth, e.g., northern lights, space weather, meteors incidents and 
climate issues. In this project, this information will be made 
accessible through interactive visualization, giving possibilities for 
both researchers and a general public to explore the phenomena and 
processes that characterize the atmosphere.

PH.D. POSITION IN MACHINE LEARNING FOR PLANETARY IN-SITU SPECTROSCOPIC 
DATA AT GERMAN AEROSPACE CENTER IN BERLIN

A newly founded junior research group at the German Aerospace Center 
(DLR) in Berlin will investigate methods from the field of machine 
learning for the analysis of spectroscopic in-situ planetary data. 
Techniques like laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) or Raman 
spectroscopy have many advantages for the robotic exploration of 
extraterrestrial bodies and Mars missions such as the recently landed 
rover Perseverance and its predecessor Curiosity are equipped with 
such instruments. However, the physics behind these methods is complex 
and not all problems can be solved analytically. Therefore, we want to 
investigate machine learning methods to address the challenging 
complexity in the data.

The Ph.D. project will include laboratory measurements with highly 
performant but also compact instrumentation, simulating, for example, 
Martian atmospheric conditions. The focus will be on the classification 
and identification of geological samples, thus different types of 
minerals and rocks. We are looking for a motivated and enthusiastic 
student with an expertise in data science and a high interest in the 
Solar System exploration.

MARS PATHFINDER AND MARS PHOENIX LANDER TARGETS NOW AVAILABLE IN MARS 
TARGET ENCYCLOPEDIA

The Mars Target Encyclopedia (MTE) aims to collect in one place 
information about observational targets (e.g., rocks, soils) 
identified and named during Mars surface exploration. The MTE links 
targets to publications that provide information (e.g., composition, 
provenance, interpretation) about each target. Version 1.2 of the MTE 
was recently released and includes targets from the Mars Pathfinder 
and Mars Phoenix Lander missions identified in the proceedings from 
the Lunar and Planetary Science Conference from 1998 through 2020. 
This release also includes compositional relations (elements or 
minerals in a target) and properties (e.g., "icy soil", "pitted"). The 
MTE database is available at

https://pds-geosciences.wustl.edu/missions/mte/mte.htm

More information about the latest release is available at

https://www.hou.usra.edu/meetings/lpsc2021/pdf/1278.pdf

Current work on the MTE is funded by a NASA PDART grant and is a 
collaboration between the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory and the 
University of Utah.

COSPAR UPDATES ITS PLANETARY PROTECTION POLICY FOR MISSIONS TO THE 
MOON'S SURFACE

COSPAR, the Committee on Space Research, and its Panel on Planetary 
Protection (PPP) have recommended on May 18, 2021 that missions to the 
Moon would remain under the general terms of COSPAR Planetary 
Protection Policy Category II, but have added two sub-categories for 
lunar surface missions.

Category IIa concerns all missions to the surface of the Moon whose 
nominal mission profile does not access the areas defined in Category 
IIb below. For those missions, the material inventory recommended by 
COSPAR will now be limited to those organic products that may be 
released into the lunar environment by the propulsion system.

Category IIb concerns all missions to the surface of the Moon whose 
nominal mission profile accesses the socalled Permanently Shadowed 
Regions (PSRs) and the lunar poles, in particular latitudes south of 
79S and north of 86N. For these missions, a full organic inventory, 
i.e. for solid and volatiles, will still be recommended.

AGU SESSION DI004: DIVING DEEP - INVESTIGATIONS OF PLANETARY INTERIORS 
THROUGH OBSERVATIONS, MODELING, AND EXPERIMENTS

Synergetic measurements such as gravity, seismic and magnetic field 
measurements, paired with surface mineralogy, geological observations, 
meteorite composition, and atmospheric data provide valuable 
constraints for numerical models and experiments. The combination of 
such constraints help to improve our understanding of the physical and 
chemical processes that have shaped the interior of rocky bodies in 
the Solar System through time. The increase of computational power 
and improvements in experimental techniques have made it possible to 
tackle complex scenarios relevant for pressure and temperature 
conditions that govern the interior of planets and moons, in order to 
understand their current and past dynamics. This session invites 
contributions from numerical modeling and experimental work that 
incorporate current planetary mission data and address future 
measurements that are necessary to place constraints on the evolution 
and present day state of planetary interiors for the Moon, Mars, 
Mercury, Venus and beyond.

AGU SESSION EP036: SURFACE PROCESSES ON EXTRATERRESTRIAL ROCKY BODIES

Quantitative models derived for surficial processes on Earth are often 
applied to other planetary bodies, providing critical insights into 
the geologic history of the Solar System. Extraterrestrial surfaces 
present opportunities to test these models under conditions that are 
often unachievable on Earth or in the laboratory. This session's goal 
is to explore the interplays between quantitative models of planetary 
surface processes and the challenges imposed on these models by new 
planetary data. We invite contributions in the field of planetary 
surface processes that use planetary analogues, laboratory 
experiments, theoretical and numerical modeling, and planetary 
exploration data from robotic spacecraft. We intend for this session 
to foster more collaboration between members of the PS and EPSP 
sections.

AGU SESSION P014: HYDROTHERMAL PROCESSES IN THE EVOLUTION OF SOLAR 
SYSTEM BODIES

Hydrothermal settings host heated fluids reacting physically and 
chemically with surrounding rocks. On Earth, those occur deep in the 
critical zone marked by coupled biological, chemical, geological, 
thermophysical and atmospheric processes. Decoupled from 
photosynthesis, microbes can use leachate-rich water via organic-rich 
sediments, redox gradients, and thermal energy for metabolism, making 
habitable zones plausible throughout the Solar System. Thermal sources 
tied to planetary evolution, such as magma bodies, meteoritic impacts, 
radiogenic heating, tide-flexing and metamorphism underpin 
hydrothermalism. Hydrothermal cooling can also modulate geophysical 
evolution, by curtailing the viscoelastic relaxation of subsurface 
topography. However, the extent of thermal sources, signatures of 
paleo-hydrothermalism, and associated timescales are poorly known. 
Accordingly, we welcome works on the role of hydrothermal processes in 
geologic and biologic evolution across the Solar System, including 
ocean worlds like Europa. Laboratory and field findings, such as of 
amagmatic hydrothermal sites, and connections between Earth and 
planetary systems are especially welcome.

AGU SESSION P016: ILLUMINATING THE MARTIAN ROCK CYCLE WITH REGIONAL 
GEOCHEMISTRY

Summary: Chemical maps of Mars, derived from the Mars Odyssey 2001 
mission's gamma and neutron spectrometers, regionally characterize the 
distribution of key elements at depth scales unmatched by other 
missions. Resulting works address unknowns of the martian rock cycle, 
such as changes across Noachian-Amazonian eons in pathways from 
igneous rocks to sediment to lithification. Those span soil alteration 
processes across Mars, thermal evolution of the mantle, provenance of 
globally distributed dust, etc. However, unresolved questions remain, 
such as the provenance of chemical provinces, evolution of individual 
volcanic provinces, and processes enriching K and Th in the lowlands. 
Accordingly, we solicit presentations on the synthesis of in situ and 
regional observations; on geological interpretations from regional 
geochemistry; and on refining the chemical maps. Regional geochemical 
context for in situ regolith evolution as at Jezero Crater, 
geochemical constraints on geophysical properties, and analog studies 
to interpret geochemical signatures are similarly welcome.

AGU SESSION P017: IN SITU GEOPHYSICAL EXPLORATION OF PLANETARY BODIES

Recent planetary landers and rovers have introduced new geophysical 
approaches to characterizing planetary bodies. The acquisition of 
geophysical data (e.g. magnetic, radar, seismic, thermal, permitivity, 
etc.) makes it possible to characterize in unprecedented detail the 
interior of the study target, helping detect cores, characterizing 
regoliths, and exploring near-surface resources that could one day 
sustain long-lived exploration. We invite abstracts that present 
results from recent missions that involve geophysical instruments, 
such as InSight, Hayabyusa2/MASCOT, and the Chang'E 3, 4, and 5 
landers and rovers. Discussion of novel exploration strategies, 
methods, and instruments that could be deployed in upcoming missions 
to the Moon, Mars, Europa, and elsewhere, are also welcome.

AGU SESSION P021: MARS SAMPLE RETURN - CHALLENGES AND ADVANCES IN 
PLANNING FOR THE FIRST SAMPLES FROM ANOTHER PLANET

Mars Sample Return (MSR) has long been a high priority for the 
international planetary science community. The Perseverance rover is 
currently at work exploring the Jezero Crater region of Mars with the 
goal of assembling a set of scientifically compelling samples from 
geologically diverse areas. Beginning in 2018, NASA and ESA have been 
working jointly on planning to achieve Mars Sample Return with the 
current goal of delivering the samples to Earth as early as 2031. This 
session will include posters that address topics such as the science 
that could be achieved with the samples collected by Perseverance 
importance of MSR, how the science benefits will be shared across the 
science community, engineering and planetary protection planning 
status updates, recommendations for the Sample Receiving Facility 
(SRF), planning for sample analyses, and public engagement and 
outreach strategies.

Participation is possibly either virtually or in-person. The conveners 
invite abstracts to be submitted through August 4:

We look forward to an exciting session.

AGU SESSION P022: MERCURY AT THE DAWN OF THE BEPICOLOMBO ERA - 
INTERDISCIPLINARY EXPLORATION INSIDE AND OUT

Please consider submitting an abstract. The deadline is August 4 2021 
at 23:59 EDT.

NASA's MESSENGER mission revolutionized our understanding of Mercury's 
surface, interior, exosphere, magnetosphere, and heliospheric 
environment. That understanding will soon take a major step forward 
with data from the first flyby of Mercury by the ESA-JAXA BepiColombo 
mission, subsequent flybys, and eventual orbit. In this session, we 
welcome all contributions on data analysis, laboratory measurements, 
ground-based observations, analog studies and theoretical developments 
that build on the current state of knowledge of Mercury, as well as 
papers that focus on how BepiColombo measurements collected during the 
recent Earth and Venus flybys can be used to support investigations at 
Mercury. The topics of interest for this session include Mercury's 
geology, geochemistry, and geophysics, and plasma dynamics occurring 
in Mercury's exosphere and magnetosphere. We also strongly encourage 
papers discussing how outstanding questions about Mercury can be 
addressed by future observations expected from BepiColombo.

AGU SESSION P032: SPACE ENVIRONMENTS AND WEATHER OF UNMAGNETIZED OR 
WEAKLY MAGNETIZED SOLAR SYSTEM BODIES

Hybrid Meeting, New Orleans, December 13-17 2021

The ionospheres and magnetospheres of weakly magnetized bodies with 
substantial atmospheres (e.g. Mars, Venus, Titan, Pluto and comets) 
are subject to disturbances due to solar activities, interplanetary 
conditions, or parent magnetospheric environments (e.g. solar flares, 
coronal mass ejections and solar energetic particles), sharing 
similarities with their magnetized counterparts but with 
scientifically important differences. This session invites abstracts 
concerning remote and in-situ data analysis, modeling studies, 
comparative studies, instrumentation and mission concepts for weakly 
magnetized Solar System bodies. Topics such as dayside and nightside 
ionospheric characteristics and variability, ion-neutral coupling, and 
responses of the ionized and neutral regimes to transient space 
weather events are especially encouraged.

AGU SESSION P033: SURFACE PROCESSES ON ACTIVE ICY WORLDS

The extreme conditions and exotic ices on the surfaces of outer solar 
system bodies result in unique landscapes not commonly observed on 
rocky bodies. Sublimation of volatile ices controls the evolution of 
many icy world landscapes and has given rise to planetary climates, 
while tectonic and eruptive processes evolve ice shells, interacting 
with potentially habitable subsurface oceans. The many interrelations 
between these processes are only beginning to reveal themselves; as 
exploration of the outer Solar System proceeds at a progressively 
rapid rate, the complexities of these worlds will continue to grow. To 
piece together these exotic planetary landscapes, will require 
investigations that incorporate increasingly diverse scientific 
techniques and collaboration between the many sub-communities studying 
icy worlds - from those who study comets, to Arrokoth, and everything 
in between. We invite contributions ranging in focus from comparative 
planetology and remote sensing, to laboratory and analog studies, to 
theoretical and numerical modeling.

AGU SESSION P040: TITAN - ATMOSPHERE, SURFACE AND INTERIOR

Titan is the only moon in the Solar System with a dense atmosphere and 
active hydrologic system. It is also an Ocean World, with a deep 
interior water ocean that may provide a harbor for life. 
Photochemistry in the stratosphere consumes methane and generates a 
wealth of complex organic molecules, similar to the atmospheric 
chemistry of prebiotic Earth. Molecules grow in size through a variety 
of processes, ultimately forming haze particles that settle on the 
surface and are reworked into large equatorial dune fields. In the 
lower atmosphere methane and ethane form lakes, seas, clouds and rain 
in a weather cycle analogous to the Earth's water-based meteorology. 
The surface exhibits infrequent craters, but offers other mysterious 
landforms interpreted as mountains, putative cryovolcanoes, tectonic 
features, and fluvial/lacustrine morphologies.

In this session we welcome all recent research relevant to Titan, 
including new observations, spacecraft data analysis, modeling and 
laboratory experiment work. Submit abstracts through the AGU portal.
