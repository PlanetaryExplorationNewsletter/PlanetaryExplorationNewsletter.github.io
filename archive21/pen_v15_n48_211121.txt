UPDATE LETTER FROM DECADAL CO-CHAIRS

Dear colleagues,

We are pleased to report that this past week the full text of the
Planetary Science and Astrobiology Decadal Survey report was assembled
and it will be distributed to reviewers in the near future.  We are
committed to ensuring on-time delivery of our report in March 2022 so
that its recommendations can be incorporated into FY24 budgetary 
planning.

If you are asked to serve as a report reviewer, we ask that you please
give your full consideration to this request.  While of course we would
prefer that every reviewer comment on the entire report, reviews of
portions of the document that address topics with which you are most
familiar would be extremely valuable too.

At this time of year especially, we want to express the tremendous
gratitude we feel for the efforts and commitment of our colleagues that
have contributed and will contribute to this important effort to 
sustain and further the success of our field. We wish you and yours a 
wonderful Thanksgiving holiday.

Best regards,

Robin Canup and Phil Christensen, co-chairs

2022 PIERAZZO INTERNATIONAL STUDENT TRAVEL AWARD

After monitoring the COVID pandemic and seeing upcoming conferences
increasingly scheduled in-person, the Planetary Science Institute is
pleased to announce the 2022 Pierazzo International Student Travel
Award.

Application deadline: 9 PM PST, November 26, 2021

Awards will be announced on or before December 6, 2021.

This award is established by the Planetary Science Institute in memory
of Senior Scientist Betty Pierazzo to support and encourage graduate
students to build international collaborations and relationships in
planetary science. Two awards will be made each year, contingent upon
there being meritorious applications. One will be awarded to a
graduate student working on his or her Ph.D. at an institution within
the U.S. to support travel to a planetary science related meeting
(conferences and workshops) outside of the U.S. The second award will
be to a graduate student working on his or her Ph.D. at an institution
outside of the U.S. to support travel to a planetary science related
meeting within the U.S. These include general meetings that have
planetary-focused sessions such as the AGU, GSA, EGU and IAG.

The award consists of a certificate and up to $2000.

[NASA] ROSES-21: DISCOVERY DATA ANALYSIS DUE DATE DELAYED

ROSES Program element C.11 Discovery Data Analysis Program (DDAP) 
solicits research based on select missions of NASA's Discovery 
Program, and ESA's Rosetta and BepiColombo missions. DDAP's objectives 
are to enhance the scientific return of these missions by supporting 
new analyses, approaches and interpretations of data and samples.

ROSES-2021 Amendment 44 delays the proposal due date for DDAP. 
Proposals are now due December 9, 2021.

This year, neither NSPIRES cover page budgets nor detailed budgets are 
requested at the time of proposal submission for DDAP; proposers must 
merely identify the project duration and cost category: small 
(<$75K/year), medium (<$175K/year), or large (<$300K per year). The 
budget cost caps of submitted proposals need not match those chosen at 
the time NOIs were submitted. However, for those with proposals deemed 
selectable, who are invited to submit detailed budgets, those budgets 
may not exceed the budget cost cap category that was chosen when the 
proposal was submitted.

DDAP proposals will be evaluated using Dual-Anonymous Peer Review and 
must be prepared following the guidelines provided.

Questions concerning C.11 DDAP may be directed to Doris Daou at 
Doris.Daou@nasa.gov.

PERMANENT SUPERVISORY BRANCH CHIEF HIRE IN PLANETARY STUDIES RESEARCH, 
NASA AMES RESEARCH CENTER

NASA Ames Research Center is seeking a permanent supervisory Branch 
Chief hire in Planetary Studies Research. Any interested applicants can 
apply on USA Jobs following the job posting in late November: 

https://www.usajobs.gov

The position is engaged in professional scientific and engineering 
work involving systematic, critical investigations directed toward 
discovering, disseminating, and applying new or expanded knowledge in 
a professional discipline. The position provides technical, 
administrative, and managerial supervision to a highly technical, 
scientific workforce engaged in both basic and applied research, 
technology and instrument concept development leading to flight 
mission concepts.

[NASA] ROSES-21: MARTIAN MOONS EXPLORATION PSP DEFERRED TO 2022

The Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) is developing the 
Martian Moons eXploration (MMX) mission for launch in 2024. MMX will 
orbit Mars, visit the Martian moons Phobos and Deimos, make close-up 
remote-sensing and in situ observations, and return a sample from 
Phobos. The Martian Moons eXploration Participating Scientist Program 
(MMX PSP) will support NASA-funded scientists on the MMX mission team 
in a variety of capacities, including but not necessarily limited to 
remote-sensing science and sample science.

C.24 MMX PSP, which had previously been listed as TBD, will not be 
solicited in ROSES this year. Instead, the Planetary Science Division 
intends to solicit it as part of ROSES-2022.

On or about November 17, 2021, this Amendment to the NASA Research 
Announcement "Research Opportunities in Space and Earth Sciences 
(ROSES) 2021" (NNH21ZDA001N) will be posted on the NASA research 
opportunity homepage at:

https://solicitation.nasaprs.com/ROSES2021

and will appear on SARA's ROSES blog at:

https://science.nasa.gov/researchers/sara/grant-solicitations/roses-2021/

Questions regarding the C.24 MMX PSP may be directed to Thomas S. 
Statler at thomas.s.statler@nasa.gov.

NEW PLANETARY GRADUATE DEGREE PROGRAM AT UCLA

The UCLA Department of Earth, Planetary, and Space Sciences is happy 
to announce the initiation of a new graduate degree program in 
Planetary Science to add to its three existing graduate degree 
programs in Geology, Geochemistry, and Geophysics and Space Physics. 
UCLA has had a world-class research program in the field of Planetary 
Science for many years, and the department currently has eighteen 
faculty members who are actively engaged in planetary research on a 
full-time or part-time basis. The new degree program will focus on 
training the next generation of planetary scientists by providing a 
curriculum of graduate-level courses as well as opportunities to 
conduct research at the forefront of knowledge in the field. 
Applications are now being accepted for new M.S. and Ph.D. students 
for the 2022-2023 academic year. Financial support is available 
through merit-based and competitive fellowship awards, research 
assistantships, and teaching assistantships that provide stipends in 
varying amounts and may include tuition, fees and nonresident 
supplemental tuition.
