[NASA] DUE DATE EXTENSION AND FAQ UPDATE FOR PROPOSALS TO SUPPORT 
PLANETARY ANALYSIS GROUPS

Based on stakeholder feedback and recognizing the challenges inherent
to coordinating proposals with all of the Planetary Analysis Groups,
the planetary science division has extended the deadline for proposals
to support planetary analysis groups by two weeks to March 29, 2021. 

The FAQ on the NSPIRES page for Program element E.2 Topical Workshops,
Symposia, and Conferences has also been updated:

MOON TREK USER EXPERIENCE FEEDBACK

NASA Solar System Treks

https://trek.nasa.gov 

is working with a group of students at the CLAWS (Collaborative Lab for
Advancing Work in Space) at University of Michigan to kick off a study
to better understand user needs from Moon Trek and to improve user 
experience.

https://trek.nasa.gov/moon

The study will include informal individual 1 hour interviews and
discussions to collect feedback during the first 2 weeks of March.

We are looking for individuals at all experience levels who have used
Moon Trek or plan to use Moon Trek, such as scientists, citizen
scientists, data providers, tool developers, educators and students.

If you are interested in participating or would like more information,
please contact claws.uxui@umich.edu.

Thank you in advance for your interest and help

ESA ARCHIVAL RESEARCH VISITOR PROGRAMME

To increase the scientific return from its space science missions, the
European Space Agency (ESA) welcomes applications from scientists
interested in pursuing research projects based on data publicly
available in the ESA Space Science Archives.

The ESA Archival Research Visitor Programme is open to scientists, at
all career levels, affiliated with institutes in ESA Member States and
Collaborating States. Early-career scientists are particularly
encouraged to apply. PhD students are also welcome to apply through
their supervisors.

During their stay, visiting scientists will have access to archives and
mission specialists for help with the retrieval, calibration, and
analysis of archival data. In principle, all areas of space research
covered by ESA science missions can be supported.

Residence lasts typically 1-3 months, also distributed over multiple
visits. Research projects can be carried out at ESAC (Madrid, Spain)
and at ESTEC (Noordwijk, Netherlands). To offset expenses incurred by
visitors, ESA covers travel costs and provides support for lodging
expenses and meals.

Applications received before April 30, 2021 will be considered for
visits in autumn 2021.

PH.D. STUDENT IN SPACE PHYSICS IN KIRUNA, SWEDEN

The Swedish Institute of Space Physics (IRF) is a government agency
that conducts research and postgraduate education in space physics,
atmospheric physics and space technology. Many of IRF's projects are
run as large international projects in collaboration with other
research institutes and space agencies.

https://www.irf.se

Applications are invited for a Ph.D. student position to study the
plasma environment of Saturn's moon, Titan. The work will mainly
consist of data analysis from our instrument on the Cassini satellite,
but also modelling, with focus on dynamic processes in Titan's plasma
environment. The goal of this project is to understand these processes
in greater detail.

The position is available at the IRF Uppsala office, located at the
Angstrom Laboratory, Sweden.

POSTDOC OPENING AT CU BOULDER IN PLANETARY ATMOSPHERIC EVOLUTION

LASP / CU Boulder encourages all candidates to apply for a NASA-funded
postdoctoral position in planetary atmospheric evolution, with a focus
on upper atmospheric modeling and observations. Work would begin
June-July 2021, with an application received by May 1, 2021 receiving
full consideration.

The position focuses on understanding the water loss history of Mars
and Venus, using modeling and observations to constrain the escape of
hydrogen and deuterium from the upper atmosphere to space. The selected
candidate would focus on nonthermal loss mechanisms, taking ownership
of and extending an existing Monte Carlo modeling code. The candidate
would bridge the gap between Mars and Venus observations and models,
using data from the Pioneer Venus Orbiter (PVO), Mars Atmosphere and
Volatile EvolutioN (MAVEN) spacecraft and the Emirates Mars Mission
(EMM) as inputs to the model and validation of its predictions.

The University of Colorado Boulder is committed to building a
culturally diverse community of faculty, staff, and students dedicated
to contributing to an inclusive campus environment.
