ROGER J. PHILLIPS - A CELEBRATION OF LIFE (JANUARY 11, 2021)

An on-line celebration of the life of Roger J. Phillips (June 9, 1940 -
November 19, 2020) will be held on January 11, 2021, from 3:00-4:30 pm
CST, hosted by Washington University. Roger received his Ph.D. in 1968
from the University of California at Berkeley. He then worked at the
Jet Propulsion Laboratory and at the Lunar and Planetary Institute,
where he served as director. He served on the faculty of Southern
Methodist University from 1982-1992, and then at Washington University
in St. Louis where he served as the director of the McDonnell Center
for the Space Sciences until 2007. After retiring from Washington
University, he continued as an emeritus faculty and joined the
Southwest Research Institute in Boulder, Colorado. Roger made lasting
contributions in the field of planetary geodynamics, and was recognized
as a fellow of the American Geophysical Union, a recipient of the G. K.
Gilbert Award from the Geological Society of America, and the Whipple
Award from the American Geophysical Union.

VECU21 SESSION PS7: PLANETARY GEOMORPHOLOGY

Dear colleagues,

A reminder that the abstract deadline for vEGU21: Gather Online is
approaching (13 January 2021, 13:00 CET). vEGU21 is a fully virtual
replacement for the EGU General Assembly, and will take place 19-30
April 2021.

Please consider submitting an abstract to the session on Planetary
Geomorphology (GM11.1/PS7):

The Planetary Geomorphology session aims to bring together
geomorphologists who study the Earth with those who work on other
bodies such as Mars, Venus, Mercury, the Moon, icy satellites of the
outer Solar System, comets, and/or asteroids. Studies applicable to
landscapes on any scale on any solid body are welcome. We particularly
encourage those who use Earth analogues or laboratory/numerical
simulation to submit their work. Considered processes could include
aeolian, volcanic, tectonic, fluvial, glacial, periglacial, or
"undetermined" ones. We especially welcome contributions from
early-career scientists and geomorphologists who are new to planetary
science.

VEGU21 SESSION PS4.3: PLANETARY SPACE WEATHER

Deadline for abstract submission is Jan 13, 2021, 13:00 CET.

In the present session, we welcome abstracts from all planets' upstream
solar wind activities and their relation to planetary space weather,
including especially magnetized bodies (like Mercury, the Earth, Saturn
and Jupiter) as well as comparisons with unmagnetized bodies (Mars and
Venus). Since in these years many operative missions have among their
science goals the planetary space weather, such as BepiColombo that
will have soon two Venus Flybys and then six Mercury flybys, or Solar
Orbiter that will have diverse Venus flybys as well, special focus of
this session will be on Venus and Mercury and on the possible studies
related to multi spacecraft observations. In this frame, we welcome
studies on:

* magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling dynamics (and auroras where
  present);
* the solar wind interaction with planets and moons;
* inter-comparisons of planetary environments;
* observations of space weather effects from space probes and
  Earth-based instrumentation; 
* theoretical modeling and simulations, especially in view of
  measurement analysis and interpretation;
* potential impacts of space weathering on technological space systems.

VEGU21 SESSION PS2.1: ATMOSPHERES AND EXOSPHERES OF TERRESTRIAL
PLANETS, SATELLITES, AND EXOPLANETS

Dear colleagues,

I'm pleased to announce that the abstract submission is open for vEGU
2021, held online on 19-30 April 2021.

The deadline for the abstract submission is 13 January 2021, 13:00 CET.

I would like to draw your attention to our session: Atmospheres and
exospheres of terrestrial planets, satellites, and exoplanets

This session primarily focuses on the neutral atmospheres of
terrestrial bodies other than the Earth. This includes not only Venus
and Mars, but also exoplanets with comparable envelopes and satellites
carrying dense atmospheres such as Titan or exospheres such as
Ganymede. We welcome contributions dealing with processes affecting the
atmospheres of these bodies, from the surface to the exosphere. We
invite abstracts concerning observations, both from Earth or from
space, modeling and theoretical studies, or laboratory work.
Comparative planetology abstracts will be particularly appreciated.

If you consider submitting an abstract in this session, you can use the
following link:

Hope to see you online!

Best regards,

The conveners

[NASA] PDS: DATA RELEASE CALENDAR 2021 

The Planetary Data System (PDS) has posted its Data Release Calendar
for 2021:

https://pds.nasa.gov/datasearch/subscription-service/data-release-calendar.shtml
 
The PDS Data Release Calendar is a searchable and sortable table of
important dates associated with all PDS data releases in the current
calendar year. The calendar includes anticipated release dates for
mission data, actual release dates updated as they occur, and links to
pages for more information and to download the data. This information
can be used to determine which data are acceptable for use in NASA
ROSES proposals. However, the final authority on data acceptability for
any ROSES opportunity rests with the designated Program Officer for
that opportunity as identified in the ROSES call.

Please check the calendar regularly throughout the year for updates,
and direct questions or feedback to pds_operator@jpl.nasa.gov.

UPCOMING PLUTO SYSTEM AND ARROKOTH WORKSHOPS

The New Horizons Geology, Geophysics, and Imaging Theme Team invites
you to take part in upcoming open workshops to discuss specific topics
that are pertinent to deciphering the geological and geophysical
histories of Pluto, its moons, and the cold classical Kuiper belt
object Arrokoth. The workshops will take place at the Applied Physics
Laboratory, Maryland from July 12 to July 16 2021, and will include a
virtual component permitting full access for those participants not
attending in person. These workshops will occur concurrently with
workshops led by the New Horizons composition and atmospheres teams.

The topics include:

- Cryovolcanism in the Pluto system and implications for elsewhere in
  the Solar System.
- The enigmatic geology of Arrokoth.
- The formation and dynamical evolution of Pluto's small moons.

The anticipated outcome of these workshops is the advancement of
knowledge in their respective subject areas through the involvement of
a broad range of disciplines in the planetary community, including
analysis of New Horizons data as well as laboratory and theoretical
work.
