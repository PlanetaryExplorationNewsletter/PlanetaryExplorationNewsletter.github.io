[NASA] PDS: CATALINA SKY SURVEY DATA REVIEW

The PDS Small Bodies Node invites communuty review of a sample of the
Catalina Sky Survey (CSS) archive, as part of the PDS peer review of
this data set. The PDS peer review process is intended to ensure the
quality, correctness, and useability of the archived data. The sample
represents one night of survey data from four telescopes, plus
documentation. Once the CSS archive pipeline has been accredited by
review, it will begin nightly deliveries into the PDS archive of the
CSS survey data.

Anyone with an interest in contributing inputs to the archiving of the
CSS data is invited to participate in the review at the link below. 
Review comments must be received by Mar. 28, 2021 to make it into the
final archive.

2021 NASA PLANETARY SCIENCE SUMMER SCHOOL APPLICATIONS DUE APRIL 1

Offered by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, CA, PSSS is a
3-month long career development experience to learn the development of
a hypothesis-driven robotic space mission in a concurrent engineering
environment while getting an in-depth, first-hand look at mission
design, life cycle, costs, schedule & the trade-offs inherent in each.

Science & engineering doctoral candidates, recent Ph.D.s, postdocs,
certain engineering MS students, & junior faculty who are U.S. Citizens
or legal permanent residents (and a very limited number of Foreign
Nationals from non-designated counties) are eligible. Applicants from
diverse backgrounds are particularly encouraged to apply.

Session 1: May 24-Aug 6
Session 2: May 24-Aug 20

With workload of a rigorous 3-hour graduate-level course, participants
spend the first 10 weeks in preparatory webinars acting as a science
mission team, & spend the final culminating week mentored by JPL's
Advance Project Design Team to refine their planetary science mission
concept design & present it to a mock expert review board. The
culminating week is typically at JPL, however in 2021 it is likely to
be virtual due to Covid-19 pandemic conditions.

INFLUENCE OF A GLOBAL MAGNETIC FIELD ON ION AND ATMOSPHERIC LOSS AND
PLANETARY HABITABILITY

This 3-day workshop will be held virtually on June 15-17. Sessions
will be hosted from 9am to 1:30pm ET.

Topics of discussion will focus on atmospheric escape (including ion
outflow) from planets and moons, and the influence of planetary
magnetic fields and stellar inputs on atmospheric retention. There will
be interactions between scientists representing diverse scientific
disciplines (Heliophysics, Astrophysics, Astrobiology, and Planetary
Science) and approaches (e.g. observations, modeling, theory).
Abstracts related to the following concepts are encouraged:

   * Atmospheric escape from planets
   * Ion outflow from planets
   * Influence of magnetic fields on atmospheric escape
   * Atmospheric / ionospheric chemistry related to atmospheric escape
   * Influence of stellar outputs and their variability on atmospheric
     escape
   * Influence of atmospheric escape on planetary evolution
   * Influence of Ionosphere-Thermosphere coupling on atmospheric 
     escape
   * Exoplanet atmospheric loss and star-planet interactions
   * Future challenges and connections to other scientific fields

   Note: the term atmospheric escape includes neutral and ion escape
   processes and rates

Abstracts will be accepted starting March 15th at:

https://mach-center.org/workshop/

Abstracts are due April 21.

This workshop is hosted by the MACH Center, sponsored by NASA's
Heliophysics DRIVE program.
