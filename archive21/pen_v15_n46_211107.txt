of atmospheric model outputs. The PDS-ATM Data Scientist roles and 
responsibilities include the development of data archive pipelines and 
archiving standards for atmospheric models; providing expertise in 
model formats/outputs, storage and management of model output in cloud 
storage; and interacting with various atmospheric modeling communities.

WHITE PAPER ON BIOSIGNATURE STANDARDS OF EVIDENCE

Dear Astrobiology Community, 

In July, 2021 the Nexus for Exoplanet System Science (NExSS) and the 
Network for Life Detection (NfoLD) Research Coordination Networks 
hosted a community workshop on Biosignature Standards of Evidence. 
During this workshop, participants developed a generalized framework 
for biosignature detection and assessment, and discussed and 
identified best practices needed to develop a reporting protocol for 
potential biosignature detection. 

The participants have now completed a draft white paper report 
summarizing the workshop discussions and major findings. The white 
paper sections describe the motivation for community development of 
biosignature assessment and reporting protocols, a description of the 
generalized assessment framework, worked examples of how the framework 
could be applied for specific biosignatures and measurement 
techniques, a discussion of how the framework can be applied 
throughout a spaceflight mission life cycle, discussions on the 
reporting protocol development, and a summary of key takeaways and 
future work. 

The workshop participants are now soliciting community comments and 
offering members of the scientific community the opportunity to 
co-sign the white paper on this website:

https://www.nfold.org/soe-endorsements.

The comment period closes November 10th.

of Evidence Workshop Participants

[NASA] ROSES-21: PLANETARY MAJOR EQUIPMENT AND FACILITIES CHANGING TO 
PLANETARY SCIENCE ENABLING FACILITIES PROGRAM

Program element C.17 of ROSES 2021 is being changed from "Planetary
Major Equipment and Facilities" to the "Planetary Science Enabling
Facilities (PSEF) Program". The Planetary Science Enabling Facilities
Program Element is expected to solicit proposals as part of ROSES 2021
for facilities and associated equipment to enable planetary science
research. This is only for facility instruments. Non-facility
instruments or equipment are not eligible for this new call. However,
guidance on how to request non-facility instruments or equipment
costing greater than or equal to $50,000, either as part of a new
proposal or in support of existing awards will be added to C.1 The
Planetary Science Research Program Overview at the time that the text
of PSEF is released.

For now the due dates will appear as "TBD" in Table 2 and Table 3 of
ROSES-2021. Go to:

https://solicitation.nasaprs.com/ROSES2021

It will also appear on SARA's ROSES blog at:

https://science.nasa.gov/researchers/sara/grant-solicitations/roses-2021/

Questions concerning C.17 PSEF may be directed to Aaron Burton at
aaron.burton@nasa.gov.

DART BOARDER PROGRAM INDICATION OF INTEREST DUE NOVEMBER 16

https://forms.gle/485qLEcgPyoaPag56

The Double Asteroid Redirection Test (DART) Investigation Team is 
reopening the "DART Boarders" program, intended to introduce advanced 
graduate students and early career scientists (less than 7 years since 
a terminal degree) regardless of nationality to the experience of 
working on a mission team via an invitation to observe the DART 
Investigation Team meeting January 18-21, 2022. 

Unfortunately, we cannot offer support for time spent in the program, 
but we anticipate a commitment of roughly 20-24 hours spread over the 
week prior to and week of the team meeting.

Respondents will be selected based upon anticipated impact to their 
career path and alignment of their research interests with the mission 
objectives, giving preference to candidates without existing 
connections to the team via current advisor-student relationships. 
DART recognizes and supports the benefits of having diverse and 
inclusive communities and expects such values to be reflected in this 
opportunity.

Questions can be sent to andy.rivkin@jhuapl.edu with subject line 
"DART Boarders". The indication of interest must be filled out by 
Tuesday, November 16, 2021. Applicants will be notified of the outcome 
by mid-December.

2022 PIERAZZO INTERNATIONAL STUDENT TRAVEL AWARD

After monitoring the COVID pandemic and seeing upcoming conferences 
increasingly scheduled in-person, the Planetary Science Institute is 
pleased to announce the 2022 Pierazzo International Student Travel 
Award.

Application deadline: 9 PM PST, November 26, 2021

Awards will be announced on or before December 6, 2021.

This award is established by the Planetary Science Institute in memory 
of Senior Scientist Betty Pierazzo to support and encourage graduate 
students to build international collaborations and relationships in 
planetary science. Two awards will be made each year, contingent upon 
there being meritorious applications. One will be awarded to a 
graduate student working on his or her Ph.D. at an institution within 
the U.S. to support travel to a planetary science related meeting 
(conferences and workshops) outside of the U.S. The second award will 
be to a graduate student working on his or her Ph.D. at an institution 
outside of the U.S. to support travel to a planetary science related 
meeting within the U.S. These include general meetings that have 
planetary-focused sessions such as the AGU, GSA, EGU and IAG.

The award consists of a certificate and up to $2000.
