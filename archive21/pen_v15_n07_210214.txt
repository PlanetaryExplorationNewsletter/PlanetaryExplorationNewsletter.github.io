IN MEMORIAM: RAFAEL NAVARRO-GONZALEZ (1959-2021)

It is with great sadness we announce the death of chemist and 
astrobiologist Dr. Rafael Navarro Gonzalez on January 27, 2021 from 
complications with COVID-19. A tribute to Rafael will be scheduled at a 
TBD time when COVID-19 is a lower risk. Rafael was an internationally 
recognized and talented scientist, the recipient of the 2009 Alexander 
von Humboldt Medal, the World Academy of Sciences Award in Earth 
Sciences, and the first recipient of the Molina fellowship are only a 
few of his awards. His research blends laboratory simulations, field 
work, and theoretical modeling in chemistry, physics and biology. He 
identified the role of volcanic lightning in the origin of life on 
Earth. Rafael Navarro-Gonzalez was born in Mexico City on April 25, 
1959. He earned a Bachelors in Biology from UNAM, Doctorate in 
Chemistry from University of Maryland at College Park. Dr. Navarro 
Gonzalez established the Chemistry Laboratory Plasmas and Planetary 
Studies at the Institute of Nuclear Sciences at (UNAM). Among the most 
significant contributions are the detection of organics in Mars-like 
environments on Earth. He was a Co-I on the SAM instrument onboard 
NASA's MSL and on the HABIT instrument onboard ESA's Exomars mission.

EARTH AND SPACE EXPLORATION PROGRAM 2021
  
Applications are sought from Astrobiology, Earth and Planetary Science 
Researchers for the Earth and Space Exploration Program in Ladakh, 
India starting June 2021. The opportunity allows the resident scientist 
to conduct their own research in Ladakh (Tso Kar and Puga region) and 
serve as mentors and role-models for incoming student teams.

The program will cover return airfare, meals and stay expenses in New 
Delhi and Ladakh for the duration of residence for the scientist. (Visa 
application and COVID-related travel assistance will be provided for 
international scientists.)

Resident Scientists will get an opportunity to join an international 
team of researchers helping build the program being driven by Amity 
University Mumbai.

MARS EXPLORATION SCIENCE MONTHLY NEWSLETTER FOR FEBRUARY 2021

On behalf of R. Aileen Yingst (MEPAG Chair), Rich Zurek, Brandi 
Carrier, and Dave Beaty of the Mars Program Science Office, the 
February 2021 edition of the Mars Exploration Science Monthly 
Newsletter can be found on the web at: 

http://mepag.jpl.nasa.gov 

In this newsletter, we continue to update the upcoming conference 
schedule with postponements, cancellations, and conversions to virtual 
meetings.

We hope everyone remains safe and healthy within these stressful, 
rapidly evolving, social-isolating times.

Please send your Mars community announcements and calendar items for 
inclusion in the newsletter to Barbara at: 
Barbara.A.Saltzberg@jpl.nasa.gov

INSIGHTSEERS PROGRAM

The InSight team is organizing a pilot program intended to expose early 
career scientists to the experience of working on a mission science 
team. We are inviting a select number of senior graduate students and 
early career scientists to be "InSightSeers" to observe our next 
mission science team meeting in March. We hope that this will provide 
valuable insight into the work and team dynamics that take place on 
missions and help early career scientists make informed decisions about 
their career paths.

This opportunity is open to advanced graduate students and early career 
scientists that are U.S. citizens and green card holders. Respondents 
will be selected based upon the anticipated impact to their career path 
and the alignment of their research interests with the scientific 
objectives of the mission. InSight recognizes and supports the benefits 
of having diverse and inclusive communities and expects that such values 
will be reflected in this opportunity. Questions can be sent to 
ingrid_daubar@brown.edu with the subject line "InSightSeers". This form 
indicating your interest must be filled out by Wednesday, February 24, 
2021:

POSTDOCTORAL OPPORTUNITY IN M-CLASS LAB AT UMD

The M-CLASS Laboratory at the University of Maryland seeks a 
postdoctoral researcher to contribute to the integration and test of a 
laser-enabled Orbitrap mass analyzer, a NASA-funded protoflight 
instrument designed to characterize surface materials on the Moon and 
other planetary bodies. The primary responsibilities of the position 
include: 1) verification of component functionality and integration of 
the system-level instrument; 2) development of innovative laser 
desorption mass spectrometry (LDMS) analytical techniques, including 
2D chemical imaging; 3) demonstration of performance capabilities, 
particularly quantitative analysis of isotopic, elemental, and 
molecular signals; and, 4) coordinated measurements of lunar and/or 
other planetary analog samples. Commercial instrumentation (i.e., LTQ 
Orbitrap XL and Q Exactive, each with a custom laser source) is 
available to support comparative analyses. Interested applicants can 
request further information from the Principal Investigator, Ricardo 
Arevalo Jr. (rarevalo@umd.edu). More information on the M-CLASS 
Laboratory can be found at:
