EPSC SESSION OPS1: "PLANET" TITAN

Please consider submitting an abstract to the EPSC session OPS1:
"Planet" Titan. This will be a virtual meeting held from September
13-24, 2021.

Saturn's moon, Titan, despite its satellite status, has nothing to envy
to planets: it has planetary dimensions, a substantial and dynamic
atmosphere, a carbon cycle, a variety of geological features (dunes,
lakes, rivers, mountains and more), seasons, and a hidden ocean. It
even now has its own mission: Dragonfly, selected by NASA in the frame
of the New Frontiers program. 

In this session, scientific presentations are solicited to cover all
aspects of current research on Titan: from its interior to its upper
atmosphere, using data collected from the Cassini-Huygens mission
(2004-2017) and/or from ground-based telescopes (e.g., ALMA) and/or
based on modelling and experimental efforts to support the
interpretation of past and future observations of this unique world.

Abstract submission deadline: May 26, 2021, 13:00 CEST

EPSC SESSION OPS2: ICY WORLDS - PAST AND FUTURE EXPLORATIONS

https://meetingorganizer.copernicus.org/EPSC2021/session/41677

The exploration of the outer Solar System by Galileo at Jupiter,
Cassini-Huygens at Saturn, New Horizons at Pluto-Charon and Dawn at
Ceres, has revealed that several icy worlds harbor subsurface salty
liquid reservoirs underneath their cold surface. By flying through the
icy-vapor plume erupting from Enceladus' south pole, Cassini proceeded
for the first time to the analysis of fresh materials coming from an
extraterrestrial ocean, revealing its astrobiological potentials. Even
if there is no direct evidence yet, similar oceanic habitats might also
be present within Europa, Ganymede, Titan and Triton, which will be
characterized by future missions currently under development (JUICE,
Europa Clipper, Dragonfly), or under study (Europa Lander, Trident,
Enceladus orbiter/lander mission).

Understanding these icy ocean worlds and their connections with smaller
icy moons and rings requires input from a variety of scientific
disciplines: planetary geology and geophysics, atmospheric physics,
life sciences, space weathering, as well as supporting laboratory
studies, numerical simulations, preparatory studies for future missions
and technology developments in instrumentation and engineering.

Abstract deadline: May 26, 2021, 13:00 CEST.

Abstract submission deadline: May 26, 13:00 CEST
 
This session focuses on the environments of outer planet moons: their
atmospheres, ionospheres, plumes, aurora, magnetic fields,
magnetospheric environments and moon-magnetosphere interactions.
Abstracts on all outer planet moons are welcome, including the moons of
Saturn and Jupiter and the less explored moons of Uranus and Neptune.

Suggested topics include but are not limited to:
atmospheric/ionospheric structures and compositions, plume detections
and simulations, surface charging, auroral radio emissions,
moon-magnetosphere interaction, variability in the field and particle
environments of the moons, opportunities of future JUICE and Europa
Clipper measurements.

We welcome abstracts addressing the environments of outer planet moons
from all disciplines, including in-situ and remote sensing data
analysis, modeling and simulation results, ground-based observations
and Earth-orbit-based observations. Studies based on results from past
and current missions, such as Voyager, Galileo, Cassini-Huygens,
Hisaki, and Juno, as well as preparatory studies for future missions
such as JUICE and Europa Clipper are relevant.

EPSC SESSION TP18: FLUID CIRCULATION, FLUID-ROCK INTERACTIONS, AND
CRYOSPHERE ON MARS
 
Virtual meeting, September 13-24, 2021

This session welcomes presentations about aqueous/ice migrations and
fluid flows on the surface and subsurface of Mars. Fluid flows are
central in fields such as volcano-tectonic, diagenesis, deep-biosphere
and water/ice cycles. Accordingly, participants are encouraged to apply
for this session with contributions concerning: 1) fluid migration
mechanisms, products and effects (e.g. fluvial lacustrine environments,
mud volcanism, hydrothermalism) and 2) volatile evolution from erosion
to deposition and diagenesis. Experimental and numerical modeling of
fluid circulation processes and water-rock interaction are also welcome.

[NASA] NEW FRONTIERS 5 (NF5) ANNOUNCEMENT OF OPPORTUNITY RELEASE DATE
DELAYS
 
Beta.SAM.gov ID Number: NNH20ZDA016L
 
Estimated Release of draft AO: October 2023 (target)
Estimated Release of final AO: October 2024 (target)
Estimated Proposal due date: 90 days after AO release
 
This is a delay of approximately two years compared to the November 5,
2020 announced target date of October 2022.

The launch date for Dragonfly, the fourth mission in the New Frontiers
Program, has been delayed to June 2027. This delay of the Dragonfly
launch date is not a reflection on the progress and performance of the
Dragonfly project. Rather, the delays are driven by other missions
being in peak development and COVID-related challenges in the broader
Planetary Science Division portfolio. The updated AO schedule estimate
allows selection of the fifth New Frontiers mission at around the time
of Dragonfly's launch, thereby avoiding the budget strain of having two
New Frontiers missions in development at the same time.

NASA SMD intends to use the results of the ongoing planetary science
decadal survey, expected in early 2022, to guide the New Frontiers 5 
AO.
