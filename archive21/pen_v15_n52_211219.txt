[NASA] ROSES-21: PLANETARY SCIENCE ENABLING FACILITIES PROGRAM DEFERRED 
TO 2022

Program element C.17 the Planetary Science Enabling Facilities (PSEF)
Program allows proposals for experimental and analytical facilities to
be made available to the community that does research under the
programs supported by the Planetary Science Division in the Science
Mission Directorate of NASA. Proposals must clearly articulate the
scientific value of the research facilities that would be made
available, as well as demonstrate that there is a significant need and
user base for the facility within the community.

ROSES-2021 Amendment 57 announces that C.17 Planetary Science Enabling
Facilities (PSEF), which was TBD, will not be solicited in ROSES-2021.
However, it will be solicited in ROSES-2022.

More information at:

https://solicitation.nasaprs.com/ROSES2021

Questions concerning C.17 PSEF may be directed to Aaron Burton at 
aaron.burton@nasa.gov.

[NASA] NEW OPPORTUNITY IN ROSES: OSIRIS-REX SAMPLE ANALYSIS 
PARTICIPATING SCIENTIST PROGRAM

The objective of C.30 the OSIRIS-REx Sample Analysis Participating
Scientist Program (ORSA-PSP) is to enhance the scientific return during
the sample analysis operational phase of the OSIRIS-REx mission by
expanding participation in the mission through new investigations that
broaden and/or complement existing investigations. Work solicited by
this program element would enhance, augment, or complement planned
mission activities during the sample-analysis phase of the mission.

ROSES-2021 Amendment 60 presents a new Opportunity in ROSES-2021 with
the release of Program Element, C.30 ORSA-PSP. The due dates are TBD
until all of the critical supporting documents are available for
download on the NSPIRES page for this program element. Once that
occurs, the due dates for proposals will be released via Amendment to
ROSES. The Step-2 proposal due date will be no fewer than 90 days from
the announcement of the posting of the final critical supporting
document(s).

More information at:

https://solicitation.nasaprs.com/ROSES2021

Questions concerning C.30 ORSA-PSP may be directed to Jeffrey N.
Grossman at HQ-OREXPSP@mail.nasa.gov.

[NASA] PLANETARY DATA ECOSYSTEM CHIEF SCIENTIST

NASA's Planetary Science Division is pleased to report the recently
competed selection of Dr. Moses Milazzo as its first Planetary Data
Ecosystem Chief Scientist. Dr. Milazzo is tasked with refining and
communicating with NASA the concerns of the greater planetary
community. These concerns were recently reported in the Planetary Data
Ecosystem Independent Review Board report (PDE IRB):

https://tinyurl.com/29r9djz4

The objectives of the PDE IRB report are to enable the strategic 
development of the Planetary Data Ecosystem and to improve the 
preservation, access, and usability of planetary data.

[NASA] KSC BPS SENIOR SCIENTIST POSITION IS OPEN

The Utilization and Life Sciences Office (UBA00) at the Kennedy Space
Center is seeking a mid-to-high level Senior Scientist who will serve
as an expert consultant with responsibility for NASA Biological and
Physical Sciences Division strategic and tactical vision and planning
for fundamental and applied plant-related research for ground,
microgravity, lunar and Mars platforms. Includes providing expert
scientific leadership for the formulation and execution of all aspects
of this program.

Please feel free to pass this along to others as we have been trying to
cast a wide net with this announcement. Thank you.

This position is open to all U.S. citizens

ABSCICON 2022 SESSION: ATMOSPHERIC ESCAPE AND EVOLUTION AT TERRESTRIAL
PLANETS

Abstract submission: January 19

https://agu.confex.com/agu/abscicon21/prelim.cgi/Session/141161

Atmospheric composition is a key aspect of a planet's habitability.
However, the present-day composition tells only a fraction of the story
of a planet's atmosphere and, given the large timescales involved in
the evolution of planetary conditions and a possible biosphere, it is
necessary to understand the evolution of an atmosphere through time in
order to understand the past history of ambient conditions necessary to
harbor life. Furthermore, understanding the atmospheric escape
processes in present-day atmospheres provides an important insight not
only into the future of these planets, but also serve as proxies to
understand the evolution of exoplanetary atmospheres by informing
atmospheric models. This session invites contributions that use models
and data to understand the evolution of past, present and future
atmospheres, as well as the description of measurement ideas and
mission concepts to address these important questions.

CALL FOR A MEDIUM-SIZE AND A FAST MISSION OPPORTUNITY IN ESA'S SCIENCE 
PROGRAMME

The ESA Director of Science solicits the scientific community in ESA's
Member States for proposals for both a "Fast" mission opportunity (to
be launched in the 2030-2031 timeframe) and for a Medium mission
opportunity (to be launched around 2037). The new long-term scientific 
plan - Voyage 2050 - for the Science Programme of the European Space
Agency (ESA), has been issued in June 2021, following a broad
consultation of the scientific community and a peer review process,
with final recommendations issued by an independent scientific Senior
Committee. The plan includes three Large (L) missions in selected
science themes (Moons of the Giant Planets, From Temperate Exoplanets
to the Milky Way, and New Physical Probes of the Early Universe) and a
set of Medium (M) and Fast (F) missions. The definition of the F and M
space missions is based on a competitive, peer-reviewed selection
process. Even though the Voyage 2050 plan identifies a set of possible
themes for the Medium missions, proposals in all fields of space
science will be considered, with no prejudice.
