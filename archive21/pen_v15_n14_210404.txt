SPECIAL SSR ISSUE ANNOUNCEMENT: IN SITU EXPLORATION OF ICE GIANTS

On February 25-27, 2019, an international workshop on "In Situ
Exploration of the Ice Giants: Science and Technology" was convened at
the Laboratoire d'Astrophysique de Marseille, France. Co-sponsored by
CNRS, CNES, and JPL, the workshop was dedicated to scientific and
technology topics relevant to future in situ exploration of ice giant
planet atmospheres, including the overall need for and requirements of
ice giant system exploration in the context of future ice giant, gas
giant, Solar System, and exoplanetary studies. The Workshop comprised
65 presentations dedicated to ice giant exploration, ice giant
atmospheres and interiors, instruments and instrument technologies
needed for in situ exploration, and mission concepts. 

A special issue of Space Science Reviews was recently published
comprising papers based on presentations and discussions from the
Marseille 2019 meeting. The special issue includes timely and
comprehensive reviews of the science, instrumentation, mission concept,
and technology topics relevant to the exploration of ice giant planet
atmospheres with entry probes. The special issue of Space Science
Reviews on In Situ Exploration of the Ice Giants: Science and
Technology can be found at:

The NASA Planetary Data System announces Release 8 of data from the
InSight Lander mission to Mars. This release contains raw and
calibrated data products covering the time period from October 1, 2020,
through December 31, 2020. Some instrument teams have already released
data from October 1-12, 2020, in Release 7. The data are archived at
various PDS nodes.

SEIS (Seismometer) at the Geosciences Node
RAD (Radiometer) at the Geosciences Node
RISE (Radio Science) at the Geosciences Node
IDA (Instrument Deployment Arm) at the Geosciences Node
APSS (Temperature, Wind, and Pressure) at the Atmospheres Node

the GRS/HEND/NS suite, and May 31 through August 30, 2020, for THEMIS. 
This release includes complete reprocessings with improved calibration
of the NS Derived (DND) and Averaged (AND) Neutron Data data sets.

GRS/HEND/NS data are archived at the PDS Geosciences Node, THEMIS data
at the THEMIS Data Node, and SPICE data at the PDS NAIF Node. All data:

PDS is releasing a new version of the Derived Neutron Data (DND)
dataset, calibrated measurements from the entire mission of the Neutron
Spectrometer, of the GRS suite.

New processing algorithms include many previously rejected observations
and significantly improve data fitting methods and reduce noise. The
updated data products more accurately detect and measure water ice,
carbon dioxide ice, and hydrated minerals in the first half meter below
the surface.

The new products are at the PDS Geosciences Node:

MARCH 2021 EARLY CAREER SCIENTIST SPOTLIGHTS - NASA GODDARD SPACE
FLIGHT CENTER
 
Would you like to learn about the early career researchers currently
working at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC)? Check out this
month's Early Career Scientist Spotlight (ECSS) articles, published
here: 

https://science.gsfc.nasa.gov/600/ECSS/index.html

ECSS articles are posted monthly and showcase the research interests,
science motivations, and achievements of early career scientists at
NASA GSFC. The ECSS project was initiated to facilitate networking
during the pandemic. With almost all current communication limited to
virtual interactions, it may be a challenge to keep in touch with
colleagues and make new research connections - two very important
aspects of having a successful career in research!

The primary goal of the ECSS project is to increase the visibility of
the Goddard early career scientists both locally and to the broader
scientific community. Please feel free to share the featured articles
with your colleagues!

DUAL-ANONYMOUS PEER REVIEW TOWN HALL FOR PLANETARY AND EXOPLANETS
RESEARCH PROGRAMS

On April 28, 2021 at 3 PM Eastern, NASA's Planetary Science Division
(PSD) will host a webinar to discuss the implementation of
Dual-Anonymous Peer Review (DAPR) for the following programs under
ROSES-2021: Cassini Data Analysis Program, Discovery Data Analysis
Program, Exoplanet Research Program, New Frontiers Data Analysis
Program, Lunar Data Analysis Program, and the Mars Data Analysis
Program.

In Dual-Anonymous Peer Review, not only are proposers unaware of the
identity of reviewers, but the reviewers do not have explicit knowledge
of the proposing teams and institutions during the scientific
evaluation of the proposal. The webinar will: (1) discuss the
motivation for switching to dual-anonymous peer review, (2) describe
important changes to proposal writing to be compliant with
dual-anonymous peer review, and (3) explain how dual-anonymous peer
reviews will work.

In advance of the webinar, questions may be submitted and upvoted on
at:

DAIS (DISABLED FOR ACCESSIBILITY IN SPACE)
 
DAIS is a support, networking, and advocacy group welcoming all
disabled and chronically ill people working in or associated with
space-related fields. Some people may be unsure whether they identify
as disabled. If you have a disease or physical/cognitive condition that
creates personal obstacles and permeates your life at work and at home,
then you belong here regardless of how you describe it. We're using a
platform called Mighty Networks, which works similar to a Facebook
group but with no ads or selling data. It's simple to use in a browser
or on mobile. We hope you'll join us and spread the word!
