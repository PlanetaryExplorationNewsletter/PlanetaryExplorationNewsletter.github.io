FALL 2021 SOFFEN STUDENT TRAVEL GRANT

The Gerald A. Soffen Memorial Fund is pleased to announce the Fall 
2021 Travel Grant application opportunity for undergraduate and 
graduate students pursuing studies in fields of space science and 
engineering.

The Travel Grants enable student recipients to attend professional 
conferences to present their research. Recipients may use the Grant

POSTDOCTORAL RESEARCH FELLOW IN THE STUDY OF SOLAR SYSTEM SMALL BODIES

Applications are invited for a 2-year Postdoctoral Research Fellow in 
the Astrophysics Research Centre (ARC) at Queen's University Belfast. 
The successful applicant will work with Dr. Meg Schwamb to develop and 
exploit next-generation tools for analysing and interpreting future 
Solar System moving object detections from the Vera C. Rubin 
Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST). Rubin Observatory 
science operations are planned to begin around mid-2024, with the 
survey expected to discover millions of asteroids and tens of 
thousands of distant Solar System planetesimals. This post will focus 
on developing software pipelines and utilities for LSST Solar System 
science and applying these techniques to present-day LSST-precursor 
datasets, including the development of a pipeline to discover distant 
Solar System bodies beyond ~100 au that are not expected to be 
discoverable by the main Rubin Observatory Solar System Processing 
pipeline.

PLANET FORMATION: FROM DUST COAGULATION TO FINAL ORBIT ASSEMBLY

Dear Colleagues,

It gives us great pleasure to announce the 2022 Planet Formation
program at the Munich Institute for Astro- and Particle Physics 
(MIAPP). This program aims to bring together experts in observation 
and theory in planetary astronomy to assess the current status of 
planet formation theories, highlight problems, and explore the 
possibility of developing comprehensive models. Please see the program 
website for more details:

https://www.munich-iapp.de/final-orbit-assembly22

The structure of the program is informal. The main goal is to create 
an environment that will facilitate collaborations and new 
initiatives. There will be daily gathering for discussing specific 
topics, new results, and brainstorming.

The meeting will be held:
June 7 - July 1, 2022
MIAPP, Garching, Germany
 
To attend, please apply using the following link:

https://www.munich-iapp.de/2022-registration-planet-formation

Please also note that MIAPP requires attendance for at least two weeks.
 
Financial support is available at the rate of EUR 80 per day for
accommodation and local expenses. Additional financial support for
attendees with family and children and for graduate students are also 
available. Please see the details at:

ASLO OCEAN SCIENCES MEETING SESSION: OCEAN SCIENCE FOR OCEAN WORLDS
 
Over the last two decades, discoveries have revealed that ice-covered 
oceans exist as extreme environments in not only Earth's polar 
regions, but also in icy worlds in the outer Solar System. At 
Jupiter's moon Europa and Saturn's moon Enceladus, those oceans are 
composed of salty water tens to ~100 kilometers deep, underlain by 
rocky seafloors with potential hydrothermal activity. These conditions 
may give rise to habitable environments and, perhaps, life. This 
session will bring together ocean scientists, planetary scientists, 
and engineers who study extreme environments, ranging from ice-covered 
polar oceans to the deep sea, with the overall goal of communicating 
what we should expect and prepare for in the future exploration of 
oceans beyond Earth, including any life they might host. We welcome 
abstract contributions including observational, experimental, model-
based and technology-based approaches that study the oceans and the 
ice-ocean or seafloor-ocean interfaces in Earth and ocean worlds to 
explore structure, circulation, biogeochemical processes, requirements 
for habitability, and life.

https://www.aslo.org/osm2022/

Abstract deadline: September 29, 2021

Early career scientists (within 10 yrs of Ph.D.), are encouraged to 
present in this session - those interested in attending in person, 
contact Kathryn Pietro at kpietro@whoi.edu ASAP!

ABSTRACT DEADLINE FOR VENERA-D: VENUS CLOUD HABITABILITY SYSTEM 
WORKSHOP

Abstracts for the Venera-D: Venus Cloud Habitability System Workshop 
are due September 30 at 5 PM CDT! 

The workshop's purpose is to discuss the formation and stability of 
Venus clouds over time and their role in potential habitability. This 
workshop will discuss what is understood about past and present 
habitability, the best measurements and methods needed to address 
these questions, and how future missions will contribute to 
understanding the cloud habitability system.

We welcome all abstracts with a focus on any one of these four topics:

1. cloud layer habitability
2. inputs (interior, surface, exogenous) to and outputs from the cloud 
   layer over time
3. measurements and instruments necessary to investigate the Venus 
   cloud region
4. open questions or any additional investigations pertaining to the 
   habitability of Venus clouds.

More details, including submission instructions, can be found at:

https://www.hou.usra.edu/meetings/venera_d2021/abstracts/

In addition, following the workshop and the normal review process, the 
journal Astrobiology will consider papers with potentially high impact 
for publication in a special collection (like the one being released 
in the October 2021 issue). Jim Garvin, Oleg Kotsyurbenko, and Sanjay 
Limaye will be guest co-editors for the collection.
