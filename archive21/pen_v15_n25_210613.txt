UPCOMING OPEN DECADAL SURVEY VENUS PANEL SESSION ON VENUS LABORATORY 
RESOURCES

The Venus panel of the Decadal Survey on Planetary Science and
Astrobiology will hold a themed session on Venus laboratory
resources - including lab facilities and technologies presently
available, and those under development - on Wednesday June 16. This
session is open to the public, and will run from 11:00 am to 1:00 pm
EDT.

Confirmed speakers for this session include Murthy Gudipati (JPL), Jorn
Helbert (DLR), Leah Nakley (NASA Glenn), and Allan Treiman (LPI).

You can find connection details, as well as information on future
session themes and speakers, on the Venus panel webpage on the National
Academies website:

A Google Doc will be available on the day for members of the public to
post questions for the speakers

VENUS EXPLORATION ANALYSIS GROUP (VEXAG) WEB SITE UPDATE

The web site for the Venus Exploration Analysis Group (VEXAG) has been
updated to have the same format as other NASA Analysis Groups. You're
invited to take a look at:

USGS ASTROGEOLOGY COMMUNITY SURVEY

The purpose of this survey is to better understand the ways that our
community discovers, interacts with, and generates new planetary
science information. This includes intermediary and derived data as
well as historical material, photos, technical documents, and other
resources that cannot be archived in a long-term repository such as the
PDS. Your responses will help identify areas of future development.
Results will be summarized and respondents will remain anonymous.
Results from the survey will be presented at LPSC 2022; findings and
recommendations will be published as a USGS Open File Report. This
survey will remain open through July 2.

SPECIAL ISSUE ON "DUNE MIRGATION ON MARS" DEADLINE EXTENDED

The deadline for submissions to the special issue on "Dune Migration on
Mars" to be published in Geosciences has been postponed to October 31,
2021.

There is still time to submit to this open access journal and make sure
you get the best visibility among the aeolian scientific community for
your work on:
 - Remote sensing methods in the study of dunes (and ripples) dynamics,
 - Terrestrial dune (and ripples) analogue studies,
 - Physic of sand movement, or
 - CFD (computational fluid dynamics) simulations of the flow above
   dunes

Detailed information can be found at the Special Issue homepage:

We would highly appreciate if you could forward this to your team
members and colleagues who may also be interested in the topic.

Please contact the guest editors Daniela Tirsch (Daniela.tirsch@dlr.de)
or Simone Silvestro (simone.silvestro@inaf.it) if you have further
questions.

12TH VIRTUAL MEPAG MEETING (VM12) - 2ND INFORMATION CIRCULAR

You are invited to participate in the next virtual meeting (VM12) of
the Mars Exploration Program Analysis Group (MEPAG), scheduled for
Monday, June 21, 2021, at 1:00-5:00 pm EDT. The meeting will be
recorded and the chat box comments captured for those of you who are
unable to attend. Those items will be posted at:

https://mepag.jpl.nasa.gov/meetings.cfm?expand=vm12

The agenda includes updates about recent MEPAG, Mars Exploration
Program (MEP), and Mars Sample Return (MSR) activities. There will also
be extended discussion of the Mars Ice Mapper activity and reports from
recent Mars mission on their status and plans, including from
Perseverance, Ingenuity, InSight and Curiosity. We know it is a busy
time, but this is a chance to catch up on the many changes in Mars
exploration planning.

WebEx connectivity information is below. This meeting is open to all
members of the Mars science community including our international
colleagues. I look forward to your participation.

ASTROBIOLOGIST OPENING AT JHU APL'S SPACE EXPLORATION SECTOR

Are you motivated to understand the origin of life and habitability of
other planets? If so, consider applying to join our growing program in 
astrobiology research at JHU APL!

https://civspace.jhuapl.edu

As a world leader in space science and development and operation of
NASA-funded missions and instruments that will explore potentially
habitable worlds, APL is poised to make major contributions to this
growing field. APL is expanding its astrobiology research program,
particularly for Ocean Worlds and so are seeking a scientist who will
pursue groundbreaking advancements in developing and establishing
future astrobiological initiatives, lead proposals for astrobiology
research and technology development, and demonstrate scientific
leadership through scholarly publications and conference presentations.
The opportunity also exists for collaboration with APL's Applied
Biological Sciences Group, which maintains laboratory and informatics
resources focused on microbiological and aerosol sciences, autonomous
bio-sensing, and environmental metagenomics sequencing.

At APL we offer a vibrant, inclusive atmosphere where you can bring
your authentic self to work, continue to grow, and build strong
connections with inspiring teammates.
