[NASA] ROSES-21 AMENDMENT 34: PAYLOADS AND RESEARCH INVESTIGATIONS ON
THE SURFACE OF THE MOON (PRISM) FINAL TEXT AND DUE DATES

Program element F.10 PRISM solicits the development and flight of
science-driven suites of instruments and technology demonstration
payloads that address science goals related to the Moon. They may
address: 1) Strategic Knowledge Gaps of HEOMD and/or 2) any technology
demonstration goals of STMD that advance capabilities for science,
exploration, or commercial development of the Moon.

NASA expects to select suites for two Commercial Lunar Payload Services
deliveries: 1) Gruithuisen Domes, a nearside silicic volcanic
construct, in Q1-Q2 2025, and 2) a south polar location in Q4 2025/Q1
2026. For more information:

A Pre-proposal conference is scheduled for September 28, 2021, at 2 PM
EDT; the connection information is:

[NASA] SPACE TECHNOLOGY GRADUATE RESEARCH OPPORTUNITIES (NSTGRO22) 
RELEASED

NASA Headquarters has released the solicitation, NASA Space
Technology Graduate Research Opportunities - Fall 2022 (NSTGRO22):

https://tinyurl.com/NSTGRO22 

This call for graduate student space technology research solicits
proposals on behalf of individuals pursuing or planning to pursue
master's or doctoral (Ph.D.) degrees in relevant space technology
disciplines at accredited U.S. universities (see solicitation for
complete eligibility requirements).

Proposals in response to NSTGRO22 must be submitted electronically
through NSPIRES by November 2, 2021, 6 PM ET/3 PM PT. NSTGRO22 requires
university submission of proposals; students must coordinate with both
a faculty advisor, who will serve as Principal Investigator (PI) on the
grant, and an Authorized Organizational Representative of the
submitting university. Please see Section 3.0 Eligibility Information
special instructions for undergraduate students and those not currently
in graduate school.

Comments and questions may be addressed by email to the Space
Technology Research Grants Program at HQ-NSTGRO-Call@mail.nasa.gov.
Responses to inquiries will be answered by email and may also be
included in the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) document located on
the NSPIRES page associated with the solicitation; anonymity of

[NASA] PDS: APERIODIC PDS DATA RELEASES IN 2021.08

In August 2021, PDS ingested and made available the following data,
none of which were regularly released with an ongoing mission:

- 2021.08.13 Mars Express: MaRS raw data from extended missions 5,6
- 2021.08.12 Cassini: RADAR Data Migrated to PDS4
- 2021.08.10 Arecibo/Green Bank Radar Multi-Look Map Products of Venus

[NASA] PDS: MESSENGER DERIVED GRAVITY DATA

This release consists of two derived products. Each product is a single
file containing four binary tables following the standard format for
SHBDR gravity data in PDS (header table, names table, coefficients
table, and covariance table). One product, jgmess_160a_toposig_shb,
contains the complete 160-degree and order covariance matrix. The
other, jgmess_160a_toposig_shb_l50, contains the covariance matrix
truncated to degree 50. (Note that's an L in the name, L50 not 150.)
These products have been added to the existing MESSENGER derived radio
science data set, PDS3 data set ID MESS-H-RSS/MLA-5-SDP-V1.0, which has
been migrated to the PDS4 collection with the LID,
urn:nasa:pds:mess_rs_derived:data

The new products have both PDS3 and PDS4 labels.

The data are available from:

https://pds.nasa.gov/datasearch/subscription-service/SS-20210901b.shtml

of Mars geoscience. It will bring together specialists working on Mars
missions, remote sensing, modelling and meteorites, as well as experts
studying analogous systems, techniques, and processes here on Earth.
Contributions related to all aspects of martian geoscience are
welcomed, as are Mars-relevant studies of Earth or other planetary
bodies.

Confirmed keynote speakers include:

Prof. Nicolas Thomas, University of Bern, CaSSIS
Dr. Anna Horleston, University of Bristol, InSight
Dr Nicolas Mangold, University of Nantes, Curiosity and Perseverance

Abstracts will be accepted for both oral and poster format.
Abstract deadline: September 30, 2021

Please note that the conference will run on UK time (approximately 10
AM to 4 PM).

JOB ANNOUNCEMENT - TENURE TRACK FACULTY POSITION IN PLANETARY SCIENCE
AT BROWN UNIVERSITY

The Department of Earth, Environmental and Planetary Sciences at Brown
University invites applications for a tenure-track faculty position in
Planetary Science. Ideal candidates are those working on fundamental
processes applicable across multiple solar system bodies and who would
broaden and enhance existing departmental strengths in climate and
environmental science, geochemistry, geophysics, planetary materials,
or remote sensing. We encourage candidates from all fields of planetary
science to apply.

The successful candidate will be expected to maintain an active,
externally-funded research program, enjoy a commitment to teaching at
both undergraduate and graduate levels, and contribute to the academic
community of the department and university including efforts to promote
diversity, equity, and inclusion. Women, members of historically
underrepresented groups, and individuals with disabilities are
particularly encouraged to apply. Appointment is expected at the
Assistant Professor level, although exceptional circumstances could
warrant appointment at a higher level. The position will remain open
until filled, but review of applications will begin Oct. 1, 2021 with
an anticipated start date of July 1, 2022. For further information,
please visit: 

https://apply.interfolio.com/90367
