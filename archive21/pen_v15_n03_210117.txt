MEPAG 2ND INFORMATION CIRCULAR

I cordially invite you to participate in the next virtual meeting
(VM11) of the Mars Exploration Program Analysis Group (MEPAG),
scheduled on Wednesday, January 27, 2021, at 1:00 pm-5:00 pm EST. 
The meeting will be recorded and the chat box comments captured for
those of you who are unable to attend. Those items will be posted at:

https://mepag.jpl.nasa.gov/meetings.cfm?expand=vm11

The agenda includes updates about recent MEPAG, Mars Exploration
Program, and Mars Sample Return (MSR) status and activities, including
NASA responses to the recent MSR Independent Review Board (IRB) report.
There will also be reports on the Decadal Survey Mars Panel activities,
a Human Exploration & Operations (HEO) update, and a debrief on a
recent Humans to Mars Conference. We know it is a busy time, but this
is a chance to catch up on the many changes in Mars exploration
planning.

This meeting is open to all members of the Mars science community 
including our international colleagues, and I look forward to your

OPEN MEETING ABOUT THE INDEPENDENT REVIEW BOARD FOR THE PLANETARY DATA
ECOSYSTEM

The NASA Planetary Science Division has established an Independent
Review Board (IRB) for the Planetary Data Ecosystem (PDE), defined as
the ad hoc connected framework of activities and products that are
built upon and support the data collected by planetary space missions
and research programs which are primarily NASA funded. Many familiar
tools and archives are part of the PDE, including (but not limited to):
ADS, AstroMat, DAPs, data policies & standards, JMars, JPL Horizons,
MAPSIT, NASA Github, PDS, Planetary Geologic Mapping, Planetary
Photojournal, Quickmap, RPIFs, and USGS Astrogeology ISIS3. The IRB
will conduct a review of the PDE with the goal of defining the full
environment, identifying missing or overly redundant elements, and
providing findings and prioritized, actionable recommendations for
PSD's long-term planning in support of the PDE. 

The PDE IRB will hold an open meeting on January 21, 2021 from 11am-2pm
EST. The community is invited to attend as observers (but not as
participants). The meeting may be joined by using this link or dial-in

POSTDOCTORAL RESEARCH ASSOCIATE, UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON, SEATTLE

Applications are invited for a postdoctoral position in the Dept. of
Earth and Space Sciences, University of Washington, to work on
planetary geochemistry using a combination of lab work and numerical
modeling. The position will be supervised by Prof. David Catling. The
postdoctoral researcher will be expected to contribute to NASA-funded
research about the nature of brines on Mars and the chemistry and
habitability of Enceladus' ocean. We are also interested in a person
who can contribute to research about the geochemical environment for
the origin of life on early Earth and early Mars.

Applicants must hold a PhD in a relevant field, e.g., Planetary
Science, Chemistry, Geology/ Earth Sciences, Physics. Experience in
practical work involving geochemistry is strongly desirable, as well as
experience in - or the confidence to learn - numerical modeling of
aqueous geochemistry. The successful candidate will also be encouraged
to cooperate with researchers and students in the university's
cross-campus Astrobiology Program. Applications received by Feb 15,
2021, will receive higher priority.

POSTDOCTORAL POSITION IN YOUNG STARS AND PLANET FORMATION AT THE
UNIVERSITY OF HAWAI'I

Applications are invited for a postdoctoral position at the University
of Hawai'i on circumstellar disks, planet formation, and variability
of young stars. The successful applicant will work with Dr. Eric
Gaidos and other investigators in the UH node of a NASA
Interdisciplinary Consortium for Astrobiology Research, and become a
leading member of a Key Project of the Las Cumbres Observatory. The
project uses occultation by circumstellar dust to study the inner
planet-forming regions around young stars, including disks,
planetesimals, and "exocomets".

A PhD in physics, astrophysics, astronomy or related field is required.
Applicants with experience with transient astronomy, photometry
surveys, and/or machine learning are especially welcome. The
appointment will be for two years, with additional years dependent upon
funding, satisfactory performance, and compliance with federal/state
laws. 

Start date: Between August 1 and the end of 2021.

POSTDOC POSITION: COUPLED INTERIOR ATMOSPHERE EVOLUTION OF VENUS AND
VENUS-LIKE EXOPLANETS

The Institute of Planetary Research at the German Aerospace Center
(DLR) in Berlin invites applications for a postdoc position within the
framework of a DLR junior research group. The group investigates the
thermochemical evolution of Mars and Venus and employs an
interdisciplinary approach that combines large-scale geodynamical
models of thermal evolution with petrological and geological datasets.
The successful candidate will use the geodynamical code GAIA and study
the coupled evolution of the interior and atmosphere of Venus and
Venus-like exoplanets. The goal of this postdoc project is to
investigate the effects of partial melting and outgassing processes on
the interior dynamics, lithosphere and crust of Venus and Venus-like
exoplanets over their thermochemical history.

Candidates should hold a PhD in Planetary Science, Geophysics or
closely related fields.
