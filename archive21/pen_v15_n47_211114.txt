2022 PIERAZZO INTERNATIONAL STUDENT TRAVEL AWARD

After monitoring the COVID pandemic and seeing upcoming conferences 
increasingly scheduled in-person, the Planetary Science Institute is 
pleased to announce the 2022 Pierazzo International Student Travel 
Award.

Application deadline: 9 PM PST, November 26, 2021

Awards will be announced on or before December 6, 2021.

This award is established by the Planetary Science Institute in memory 
of Senior Scientist Betty Pierazzo to support and encourage graduate 
students to build international collaborations and relationships in 
planetary science. Two awards will be made each year, contingent upon 
there being meritorious applications. One will be awarded to a 
graduate student working on his or her Ph.D. at an institution within 
the U.S. to support travel to a planetary science related meeting 
(conferences and workshops) outside of the U.S. The second award will 
be to a graduate student working on his or her Ph.D. at an institution 
outside of the U.S. to support travel to a planetary science related 
meeting within the U.S. These include general meetings that have 
planetary-focused sessions such as the AGU, GSA, EGU and IAG.

The award consists of a certificate and up to $2000.

MERCURY'S SURFACE RESPONSE TO THE INTERPLANETARY ENVIRONMENT:
IDENTIFYING NEEDED STUDIES IN LABORATORY ASTROPHYSICS

Date: January 24-27, 2022
Location: Virtual

Registration is open at: 

https://meeting.psi.edu/mercurylab2022/registration/

Mercury is a complex system of interconnected parts: magnetosphere,
exosphere, and surface. How Mercury responds to its interplanetary
environment is equally complex. Models help us understand how solar 
wind and micrometeorites modify Mercury's surface spectral, mineral, 
and chemical properties and produce the planet's exosphere. This 
workshop will focus on identifying those processes whose uncertainties
hinder our ability to reliably model Mercury's response to the 
interplanetary environment. We will discuss the laboratory 
astrophysics studies, theoretical and experimental, most needed to 
advance our understanding of Mercury's system.

Registration fee: $115 USD (through December 6, 2021) and $175 USD 
(after December 6, 2021)

Some financial support is available for young and/or early career
scientists, as well as scientists not yet involved in Mercury related
science topics. To apply for support, please send a short email to
Johannes.Benkhoff@esa.int describing your background, providing a few
lines about why you would like to attend the workshop, and if possible,
indicating the connection of your current or planned work to the
BepiColombo mission.

EGU2022 SESSION GM11.1/PS11: PLANETARY GEOMORPHOLOGY

Please consider submitting an abstract to the session on Planetary 
Geomorphology (GM11.1/PS11) at the EGU General Assembly 2022. EGU 2022 
will be a hybrid event facilitating in-person and online participation.

The Planetary Geomorphology session aims to bring together 
geomorphologists who study the Earth with those who work on other 
bodies such as Mars, Venus, Mercury, the Moon, icy satellites of the 
outer Solar System, comets, and/or asteroids. Studies applicable to 
landscapes on any scale on any solid body are welcome. We particularly 
encourage those who use Earth analogues or laboratory/numerical 
simulation to submit their work. Considered processes could include 
aeolian, volcanic, tectonic, fluvial, glacial, periglacial, or 
"undetermined" ones. We especially welcome contributions from 
early-career scientists and geomorphologists who are new to planetary 
science.

EGU 2022 will have a truly interdisciplinary session aiming to bring 
Earth scientists and planetary scientists from a variety of backgrounds 
together to discuss important issues facing our greater world. 
Addressing the advancements and the problems of the 21st century and 
the future of Earth and surroundings put heavy emphasis on Earth and 
planetary sciences which have had some but not enough interdisciplinary 
interactions at large scopes. We hope to gather those that have already 
been involved in Earth/planetary interdisciplinary work and those that 
have been dedicated to one field but are curious to learn new 
perspectives. Please join us to give latest updates, highlight critical 
concepts, share knowledge, and foster new ideas in this rare 
multi-program session.

SBAG EARLY CAREER OPPORTUNITIES

The upcoming NASA Small Bodies Assessment Group meeting will be held 
virtually on January 24-25, 2022. There will be multiple presentation 
opportunities at this meeting specifically for the early career small 
body community including invited early-career speakers and lightning
talks. Applications for invited talks are due via email by COB (5 pm 
Eastern Time) by November 19, 2021. Lightning talk submissions are due 
by COB (5 pm Eastern time) by December 17, 2021. 

The steering committee will also implement two new opportunities for 
SBAG 26: an early-career meeting mentor program and a dedicated Slack 
space. The SBAG steering committee will pair interested early-career 
members of the small bodies community with an SBAG meeting mentor to 
help broaden the networks of early-career researchers and engineers. 
The Slack will serve as an opportunity to engage in asynchronous 
discussion related to the meeting. The link to the Slack will be 
circulated the week prior to the meeting and will be closed the day 
after the meeting. More details about these opportunities can be found 
at the SBAG meeting website:

POSTDOC POSITION AT SWRI WITH SSERVI NOTE ESPRESSO

Institution: Southwest Research Institute, Boulder, CO

We have a new post-doc position available at the Boulder office of the 
Southwest Research Institute to work on the SSERVI-supported Project 
ESPRESSO team: 

https://www.espresso.institute

The Project ESPRESSO team is studying the composition and physics of 
regolith on small-bodies (asteroids, etc.) and airless worlds (the 
Moon, etc.) with a focus on how our scientific work will enable 
future in situ robotic and human exploration. We are doing both 
laboratory and numerical research. Our laboratory work includes impact 
experiments, both in the lab and on reduced-gravity (i.e., zero-g) 
plane flights, and spectroscopy of planetary materials (e.g., Raman, 
LIBS, etc.). Our numerical work supports the laboratory work by 
simulating impact processes or improving spectral analyses, among 
other projects.

Job application can be found at the SwRI careers page:

[NASA] ANNOUNCEMENT OF SELECTIONS FOR THE MDT ON I-MIM

As a part of their collaboration on the International Mars Ice Mapper 
(I-MIM) mission concept, American, Canadian, Italian, and Japanese 
space agencies (NASA, CSA, ASI, and JAXA respectively) invited 
qualified and interested individuals to apply for membership on the 
mission's Reconnaissance/Science Measurement Definition Team (MDT).  
This team will help define measurements made by the mission's radar 
instrument and trace them to mission requirements, as well as consider 
opportunities to maximize the mission's return on investment through 
additional scientific investigations and opportunities. The MDT 
selection committee worked diligently to assemble a diverse, 
multidisciplinary team to accomplish this work. The I-MIM Team is very 
appreciative of the tremendous turnout, thanks to the interest of so 
many highly qualified applicants. The collaborating agencies are 
happy to announce the members of the MDT and look forward to using its 
findings to advance their joint concept study:
