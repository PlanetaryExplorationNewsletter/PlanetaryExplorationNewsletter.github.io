RESEARCH ASSOCIATE: ANALYSIS OF SOLAR IMAGES USING MACHINE LEARNING AND
COMPUTER VISION

Deadline: February 7, 2021 (possibly extended)

The department of Geophysics of GFZ German Research Centre for
Geosciences invites applications for a Research Associate position for
the Analysis of Solar Images Using Machine Learning and Computer Vision
in the group "Space Physics and Space Weather".

The work will be performed in the context of Helmholtz Imaging
Platform-funded Solar Image-based Modelling project and uses highly
detailed multi-spectral images of the sun to improve predictions of the
solar wind close to earth and develop new methods utilizing data driven
approaches. Specifically, we plan to exploit the capabilities of
classical computer vision tools and modern deep learning algorithms to
identify relevant structures on the sun, such as coronal holes and
corona active regions.

Candidates should have minimum:
* MSc in physics (solar physics), computer sciences, maths or related
  natural sciences.
* Experience in working with solar images, several years of working
  experience with IT programming or scientific programming.

consortium PAGER led by GFZ Potsdam The primary aim of PAGER is to
provide space weather predictions initiated from observations on the
Sun and to predict radiation in space and its effects on satellite
infrastructure.

Candidates should have minimum Master's degree in computer sciences,
physics, maths or related natural sciences. Several years of working
experience with IT programming or scientific programming, knowledge of

ANNOUNCEMENT OF OPPORTUNITY FOR INTERDISCIPLINARY SCIENTISTS AND GUEST
INVESTIGATORS

Dear Colleague,
 
ESA released an Announcement of Opportunity for Interdisciplinary
Scientists and Guest Investigators in the ExoMars 2022 mission. 
Mandatory Letters of Intent were due January 12, 2021.

Although the call is "open to scientists in institutions based in ESA
Member States, Canada and Russia", there may be US investigators
planning to participate and be involved in submitting a proposal. 
NASA anticipates allocating potentially a total of $300K per annum to
support competitive US scientists' participation in the ExoMars
mission, starting in fiscal year 2022.

The ESA due date is Feb. 15, 2021. This Dear Colleague letter can be
used as the indicator of agency endorsement for your potential
contribution to the ExoMars 2022 mission.
 
Sincerely,
Eric Ianson
Director, Mars Exploration Program
 
Michael Meyer
Lead Scientist, Mars Exploration Program

[NASA] PROPOSALS TO SUPPORT RECURRING PLANETARY SCIENCE ANALYSIS GROUP
MEETINGS

NASA's Planetary Science Division is interested in proposals through
the Topical Workshops, Symposia, and Conferences (E.2) to support the
Planetary Science communities Program Analysis Groups (PAGs). Ideally,
this would be a single proposal to provide support for all eight of the
PAGs. More information can be found at:

POSTDOCTORAL SCHOLAR

The Hayabusa2 spacecraft successfully collected samples on two
different sites at the surface of a C-type asteroid (Ruygu). These
samples were returned to Earth at the end of 2020. The IMPMC-MNHN and
IAS are at the forefront of the preliminary analysis of these Ryugu
grains, carrying out Synchrotron Mossbauer Spectroscopy and
micron-tomography FTIR. The postdoc fellow will be in charge of the
study of the composition of Ryugu's grains with a special emphasis on
the organics/hydrous silicate associations. The coupled SMS/IR-CT
analysis will allow the postdoc to unravel the role played by secondary
alteration processes (aqueous, thermal, irradiation-driven) and to
bridge the gap between spectroscopic features collected at the
microscopic to macroscopic scales to physical-chemical modifications of
primitive matter.

This fellowship is funded by the DIM ACAV+ (PI Mathieu Roskosz, CoI
Rosario Brunetto). It is entirely dedicated to the study of this unique
extraterrestrial matter. Though side projects are not strictly
forbidden, only investigations related to the characterization of this
matter will be supported.

JPGU SESSION: OUTER SOLAR SYSTEM EXPLORATION TODAY, AND TOMORROW

Please consider submitting an abstract to the "Outer Solar System 
Exploration Today, and Tomorrow" online session at the Japan Geoscience 
Union (JpGU) Meeting 2021 held on 4 June, 2021:

http://www.jpgu.org/meeting_e2021/sessionlist_en/detail/P-PS01.html

Our session will discuss a wide range of topics encompassing the giant
planets and their moons, including their origins, interiors,
atmospheres, compositions, surface features, and electromagnetic
fields. To advocate for current and future outer planets exploration
(Juno, New Horizons, JUICE, Europa Clipper, Dragonfly and beyond), we
also call for discussions on future missions to explore giant planet
systems, including how to develop better international cooperation.
Discussion in this latter category will include progress in developing
a solar sail mission concept for observing the Jupiter system and its
Trojan asteroids.

Abstracts can be submitted at the following link:
