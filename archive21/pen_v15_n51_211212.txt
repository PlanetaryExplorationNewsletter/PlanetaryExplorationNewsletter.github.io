EARLY REGISTRATION EXTENDED - MERCURY'S SURFACE RESPONSE TO THE 
INTERPLANETARY ENVIRONMENT: IDENTIFYING NEEDED STUDIES IN LABORATORY 
ASTROPHYSICS

Date: 24-27 January 2022
Location: Virtual

Registration is open at

https://meeting.psi.edu/mercurylab2022/registration/

Mercury is a complex system of interconnected parts: magnetosphere, 
exosphere, and surface. How Mercury responds to its interplanetary 
environment is equally complex. Models help us understand how solar 
wind and micrometeorites modify Mercury's surface spectral, mineral, 
and chemical properties and produce the planet's exosphere. This 
workshop will focus on identifying those processes whose uncertainties 
hinder our ability to reliably model Mercury's response to the 
interplanetary environment. We will discuss the laboratory 
astrophysics studies, theoretical and experimental, most needed to 
advance our understanding of Mercury's system.

Registration fee: $115 USD (until December 13) and $175 USD (after 
December 13)

Some financial support is available for young and/or early career 
scientists, as well as scientists not yet involved in Mercury related 
science. To apply, please send a short email to 
Johannes.Benkhoff@esa.int describing your background, providing a few 
lines about why you would like to attend the workshop, and if possible, 
indicating the connection of your current or planned work to the 
BepiColombo mission.

44TH COSPAR SCIENTIFIC ASSEMBLY: ASTROCHEMISTRY AND COMPOSITION AS 
ARIADNE'S THREADS FOR PLANET FORMATION

Abstract submission is open for the 44th COSPAR Scientific Assembly 
(16-24 July 2022, Athens, Greece in hybrid mode) and we invite you to 
participate in the scientific event "Astrochemistry and Composition as 
Ariadne's Threads for Planet Formation"

Understanding how planetary systems form is becoming an increasingly 
interdisciplinary field of study that is approaching the limits of 
insight being gained from individual disciplines. The composition of 
planetary bodies and the astrochemical processes that shape it 
represent the common thread helping us to navigate the multifaceted 
problem of planetary formation. Future studies will become even more 
interdependent and will require combining the information supplied by 
meteorites and polluted white dwarfs, the interstellar medium and 
protoplanetary disks, comets and asteroids, planetary surfaces and 
exoplanetary atmospheres, and more. This event aims to offer an 
interdisciplinary venue to bring together researchers studying the 
Solar System, exoplanets, star formation, protoplanetary disks, main 
sequence and evolved stars to combine the insights provided by their 
theoretical and experimental perspectives, as well as by observations 
from ground-based and space-borne facilities.

Abstract submission deadline: 11 February 2022

ABSCICON 2022 SESSION: EARTH GEYSERS AND OCEAN WORLD PLUMES - THE 
CHALLENGES OF CHARACTERIZING A UNIQUE ENVIRONMENT

We invite you to submit an abstract to our session that will explore 
the connection between Earth-based plume and geysers systems, to those 
found on planetary bodies and ocean worlds.

https://agu.confex.com/agu/abscicon21/prelim.cgi/Session/141148

Plume environments are present in both terrestrial systems and ocean 
worlds, and provide a means to understand the composition and 
(potential) biological communities within the reservoir from which it 
is derived. Whether a cold CO2- or geothermal-driven geyser on Earth 
or the plume of Enceladus or other ocean worlds, researchers face 
similar challenges in sampling this material and tracing its 
(bio)geochemical properties back to the source. This session invites 
submissions ranging from field work and mission studies, to 
experimental work and theoretical simulations, addressing the 
challenges of sample collection, preparation, and analyses to 
characterize geysering/plume environments. Papers that cover 
spaceborne or aerial plume fly-through sampling systems, plume/geyser 
material concentrators, purifiers, and analyses devices for field 
studies, and other instrument or technical developments are also 
encouraged. The goal of this session is to connect groups that may not 
regularly overlap to stimulate new ideas and foster collaboration.

Conveners,

Morgan Cable, Kate Craft, Alex Patthoff

ABSCICON 2022 SESSION: TITAN AS A PREBIOTIC LABORATORY

Please consider submitting to our Titan focused AbSciCon 2022 session, 
"Titan as a Prebiotic Laboratory."

https://agu.confex.com/agu/abscicon21/prelim.cgi/Session/112042

Submission deadline: January 19

From the ionosphere to its rocky core, Titan offers a unique 
opportunity to explore pathways for prebiotic chemistry. In its 
N2-CH4-based atmosphere, photolytic and radiolytic chemistry creates a 
plethora of organic compounds, including large, complex haze 
particles. These compounds eventually make their way to the surface 
where geological processes rework and redistribute Titan's prebiotic 
manna. Primordial organic material in the interior may be dissolved in 
the subsurface ocean and serve as the ultimate source of Titan's 
atmospheric methane. Whether either of these realms -atmosphere, 
surface, interior- interacts with the other through the icy crust 
remains unknown. As the most organic-rich ocean world in the Solar 
System beyond Earth, Titan represents a compelling world to 
investigate prebiotic chemistry. This session explores how 
investigating Titan's different realms provides new insight into our 
understanding of the limits of prebiotic evolution. Results from 
remote sensing data, laboratory experiments, modeling, ground-based 
observations are all welcome.

ABSCICON 2022 SESSION: CROSSING THE THRESHOLD - IN SITU INSTRUMENTATION 
TO SEEK LIFE, ITS PRECURSORS, AND GEOPHYSICAL CONTEXT ON EUROPA AND 
OTHER OCEAN WORLDS

Please submit your abstracts here!

https://agu.confex.com/agu/abscicon21/prelim.cgi/Session/112403

Submission deadline: January 19

Recent missions have revealed a host of potentially habitable 
environments on Ocean Worlds. The next step in the search for signs of 
life, complex abiotic organic chemistry, and habitability will be to 
perform landed investigations with access to the near-subsurface. 
Astrobiologically-relevant materials including organics may be present 
on these worlds at very low concentrations, driving the need for 
specialized sample handling, enrichment and preparation techniques, 
and/or extreme instrument measurement sensitivity. Missions will also 
perform critical geophysical and geochemical investigations of the 
moons' internal structures and composition, and conduct ground truth 
observations to verify remote sensing observations. Additional 
challenges are strict planetary protection constraints, limited 
communication intervals, and operation in harsh environments with 
stringent mass, power, and volume limits.

This session seeks to highlight measurement requirements, laboratory 
techniques, and instruments and technologies under development to 
address these challenges and enable detection/characterization of 
biosignatures, geophysical context, and habitability on Ocean Worlds.
