FAREWELL ELISABETH ADAMS, HELLO ALEX MORGAN

PSI Associate Research Scientist Elisabeth Adams has been a Planetary 
Exploration Newsletter editor since January 15, 2017. Over her more 
than four and a half years with PEN, she has volunteered her weekend
hours to edit and co-edit 239 issues in service to our planetary 
community. This is her last issue, after which she is retiring from her
editorship. It has been a pleasure working with her.

We would also like to welcome PSI Research Scientist Alex Morgan as a 
new PEN editor!

NASA'S NEW EUROPA TREK PORTAL

NASA's Solar System Treks Project has just released a new addition to 
its family of online data visualization and analysis portals, Europa 
Trek: 

https://trek.nasa.gov/europa 

Europa Trek combines Voyager and Galileo data to allow users to examine 
the surface of Europa and conduct interactive flights over its terrain.
Europa Trek can serve as a preview for upcoming missions including 
NASA's Europa Clipper mission and the European Space Agency's Jupiter 
Icy Moon Explorer (JUICE) mission. NASA's Solar System Treks provides 
a collection of online, browser-based data visualization and analysis 
portals for a growing number of bodies in our Solar System. The portals 
allow mission planners, planetary scientists, students, and the general 
public to study these worlds as seen through the eyes of many 
instruments aboard a growing number of spacecraft. Development and 
operations of the Solar System Treks is done at NASA's Jet Propulsion 
Laboratory, and the project is managed through NASA's Solar System 
Exploration Research Virtual Institute.
