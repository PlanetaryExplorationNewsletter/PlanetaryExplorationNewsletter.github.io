of Greece, and brings together scientists with research interests in
Astrophysics, Planetary Science, and Space Physics.

Conference sessions
Session 1: "Heliophysics and the Solar System"

Session 3: "Cosmology and Relativistic Astrophysics"
Session 4: "Stars, Planets and the Interstellar Medium"

Important dates:
Registration & Abstract Submission opens: February 1, 2021
Abstract Submission closes: April 30, 2021 
Notification of Abstract Acceptance: May 17, 2021 
Registration Deadline: May 31, 2021 
Conference Program: June 18, 2021

We look forward to seeing you in Patras!

On behalf of the Scientific & Local Organizing committee,
Prof. Vassilis Charmandaris, President of Hel.A.S.

Even though we remain optimistic that world pandemic situation will
improve and we will be able to meet in person in July, all measures are
taken for the Conference to go virtual. A decision to that extent will
be taken by April 30, 2021 and it will be announced in the conference
website.

SUMMER UNDERGRADUATE PROGRAM IN PLANETARY RESEARCH (SUPPR): MENTORS
NEEDED

SUPPR will match you with a qualified undergraduate intern for 8 weeks
during the summer. 

https://www.lpi.usra.edu/suppr/

SUPPR covers the costs of travel to and from your home institution,
housing, and provides the intern with a stipend. If COVID-19 allows,
the intern will be hosted at your home institution; if not, please note
that we successfully completed remotely mentored internships in 2020,
and mentors will be asked to consider that option for 2021.

You are eligible to apply to be a SUPPR mentor if you hold funding from
NASA's Solar System Workings (SSW). Mentor applications are due
February 17 at midnight (Eastern Standard Time).

Online mentor applications can be found at:

https://www.lpi.usra.edu/suppr/mentors/

Please email Dr. Tracy Gregg (tgregg@buffalo.edu) with any questions.

REQUESTS FOR ENDORSEMENTS FOR NEXT GENERATION ARECIBO TELESCOPE WHITE 
PAPER

The Arecibo Observatory (AO) staff, together with members of the
scientific community, prepared the white paper "The Future of the
Arecibo Observatory: The Next Generation Arecibo Telescope"", which
presents a proposal to replace the legacy 305-m Arecibo telescope with
a new, unparalleled instrument that will push forward the boundaries of
Planetary Science, Space and Atmospheric Sciences, and Astronomy for
decades to come.

This white paper will be presented to the National Science Foundation
(NSF) and will be shared with representatives from the U.S. Congress
in February to request support for the construction of the Next
Generation Arecibo Telescope (NGAT).

The community support of this white paper is a crucial factor in the
future of AO. Thus, we kindly ask you to sign this form of endorsement
for the white paper and to share it with your colleagues (and students)
in the science community. Our goal is to collect the majority of
endorsements by February 10.

MASS SPECTROMETER CALIBRATION ENGINEER

Applications are now being accepted for a mass spectrometer calibration
engineer to support the development of flight and ground
instrumentation at NASA's Planetary Environment Laboratory at
NASA/Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, MD. The position is
funded through UMBC and CRESST II.

The ideal candidate will have strong programming skills and experience
operating experimental setups. Duties will include developing software
for instrument control and data acquisition/display on the ground and
during flight. We have a considerable "code base" from development for
previous missions: MSL/SAM (Mars), LADEE/NMS (Moon), MAVEN/NGIMS
(Mars), ExoMars/MOMA (Mars), and SEAL/NMS (Moon) and several new
missions.

Desired skills include:
- BS or MA in computer science, engineering, or astronomy
- C++ for GUI applications
- Experience with Qt development
- Comfortable on multiple computer platforms (Linux, Mac, Windows)
- Experience with communication / data acquisition software development
- Some python experience a plus
- Basic laboratory / instrumentation experience. Experience on UH
  vacuum systems is a plus
- Good troubleshooting skills
- Basic electronics knowledge (DVM, oscilloscopes, ESD, safety)
- Basic physics and chemistry knowledge

Applications received by February 14, 2021 will receive best
consideration.

RESEARCH ASSOCIATE IN PLANETARY ATMOSPHERES, UNIVERSITY OF LEICESTER

Salary: Grade 7 34,804 to 40,322 pounds per annum.
Funding is available until 31 March 2022 with a possibility of
extension.
Closing date: 28 February 2021

The School of Physics and Astronomy at the University of Leicester
invites applications for one or more Research Associates in Planetary
Atmospheric Science. The Research Associates will join the atmospheres
team led by Dr. Leigh Fletcher, tasked with addressing the scientific
aims of a European Research Council (ERC) grant to explore the
atmospheres of the giant planets. The "GIANTCLIMES" programme
investigates natural cycles of meteorology, circulation, and chemical
processes shaping the four giant planets over long spans of time. The
successful applicant will be expected to develop and expand on a
pipeline for interpreting planetary observations from the James Webb
Space Telescope and ground-based facilities. We are therefore
particularly interested in candidates with expertise in planetary data
analysis, planetary atmospheres, and spectral inversion techniques, but
all applicants with a strong background in planetary science are
encouraged to apply. Enquiries to Dr. Leigh Fletcher on
leigh.fletcher@le.ac.uk.

POSTDOC OPPORTUNITY ON HAYABUSA RETURN SAMPLES

The postdoc will be in charge of the coupled analysis of mineral
analogues subjected to annealing in reducing and oxidizing conditions
and to low-energy irradiation. These conditions will be useful to
interpret spectra collected on true samples during the second half of
year 2021 and 2022. The postdoc will also present their work at the
monthly 'Min-Pet' group meetings. During the second half of 2021,
non-destructive analysis of the real grains will be performed by our
two teams. The postdoc, primarily located at the Institut de
Mineralogie, de Physique des Materiaux et de Cosmochimie (IMPMC), will
participate in all the analytical sessions of the coupled methods in
APS in Chicago and SOLEIL (Saclay). These sessions will be carried out
at least from July to November 2021 and later in 2022. The postdoc will
be a pivotal member of the team, ideally specialized on the fate of
hydrous silicates during secondary processes.

The research will take place at IMPMC in Paris, France, a 
pluridisciplinary departement where research relies on the combination 
of approaches from material science, Earth science and biology.
