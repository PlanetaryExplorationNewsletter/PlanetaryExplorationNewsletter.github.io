LUNGRADCON 2021 - CALL FOR ABSTRACTS

The 12th Annual Lunar and Small Bodies Graduate Conference (LunGradCon
2021) is to be held virtually on Thursday and Friday, July 15-16
2021, preceding the combined NASA Exploration Science Forum (NESF) and
European Lunar Symposium (ELS), July 20-23. LunGradCon provides an
opportunity for grad students and early-career postdocs studying all
aspects of the Moon or other small bodies to present their research in
a low-stress, friendly environment, being critiqued only by their
peers. In addition to pre-recorded virtual presentations, the
conference will feature Q&A panels with SSERVI leadership and other
groups to help grad students navigate the paths to careers in space
science. Students who are interested in small body space science are
encouraged to register and attend. Even if you choose not to give a
talk, LunGradCon is a great opportunity to meet and network with other
upcoming space scientists. Registration and abstract submission info
can be found on the conference website at:

http://impact.colorado.edu/lungradcon/

The deadline for LunGradCon abstract submission is May 14, 2021, 
11:59 PM PDT.

[NASA] GSFC CIVIL SERVANT JOB ANNOUNCEMENT - POSITION CLOSES MIDNIGHT 
MONDAY, APRIL 12

The Science & Exploration Directorate, Solar System Exploration
Division, Astrochemistry Laboratory (Code 691) at NASA's Goddard Space
Flight Center (GSFC) is seeking a cross-disciplinary scientist to study
agnostic biosignatures. The successful candidate will coordinate
research across disciplines that will focus ocean worlds, astrobiology,
and exoplanet science and technology. The research is expected to place
an emphasis on geochemistry, biochemistry, prebiotic chemistry, and
technology development. This is a GS-13 or 14 level position located at
NASA-Goddard in Greenbelt, Maryland near Washington, DC.

The call for this position closes at midnight on MONDAY, APRIL 12,
2021.

JOB OPPORTUNITY AT THE UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO BOULDER

The Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics at the University of
Colorado Boulder encourages applications for a postdoctoral position
with the IMPACT group:

https://impact.colorado.edu/

Through a combination of modeling, theoretical and laboratory
experiments, IMPACT investigates the physical processes governing dusty
plasmas, which have critical roles in shaping the surface and
near-surface properties of airless bodies, and ensuring human safety
and long-term usability of mechanical, and optical devices on airless
bodies.

The successful candidate will further develop a state-of-the-art
innovative numerical framework that couples the micro-physics of
grain-scaled processes with the self-consistent solution of the
near-surface plasma environment. The goal of the project is to merge
the qualitative understanding of the microscopic processes to the
macroscopic behavior of the lunar regolith, providing a much-needed
tool to advance the efficiency of dust mitigation techniques.

We require a Ph.D. in (computational) Space/Plasma Physics or a closely
related field. Details can be found on:

https://jobs.colorado.edu/jobs/JobDetail/?jobId=29553

For questions email:
Dr. Jan Deca (jan.deca@lasp.colorado.edu)
Prof. Mihaly Horanyi (Mihaly.horanyi@lasp.colorado.edu)
