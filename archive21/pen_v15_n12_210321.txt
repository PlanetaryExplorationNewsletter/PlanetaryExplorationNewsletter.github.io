[NASA] ROSES-21: NOI DUE DATE DELAY AND POC CHANGE FOR
EXOPLANETS RESEARCH

The Exoplanet Research Program (XRP) solicits basic research proposals
to conduct scientific investigations focused on exoplanets and
exoplanetary systems. The broad research objectives of XRP include, but
are not limited to: the detection and characterization of exoplanetary
systems; the characterization of individual exoplanets; and the study
of the origins of exoplanets.

The due date for Mandatory Notices of Intent has been delayed by one
week to April 2, 2021. The due date for proposals remains unchanged at
May 27, 2021. In addition, the points of contact have been updated. New
text is in bold and deleted text is struck through.

This Amendment will be posted on the NASA research opportunity homepage
at: 

http://solicitation.nasaprs.com/ROSES2021 

and will appear on SARA's ROSES blog at: 

https://science.nasa.gov/researchers/sara/grant-solicitations/roses-2021/

Questions concerning F.3 XRP may be directed to Hannah Jang-Condell at
hannah.jang-condell@nasa.gov and Megan Ansdell at

NASA / SSERVI ANALOGS FOCUS GROUP

Terrestrial analog field studies offer the unique opportunity to
prepare for robotic and human planetary missions. Analogs provide the
opportunity to conduct studies and tests related to science, mission
operations, and technology in a relevant environment at relatively low
cost and risk. The NASA / SSERVI Analogs Focus Group also considers
laboratory analyses of extraterrestrial analog materials and how
quantitative laboratory analyses can be brought into the field.

The NASA / SSERVI Analogs Focus Group hosts quarterly seminars focused
on various aspects of terrestrial analog science and exploration. Our
next seminar will be held on Friday, 16 April 2021 and will be
delivered by Dr. Gordon "Oz" Osinski (University of Western Ontario,
Canada).

More information and past seminars can be found here:

https://sservi.nasa.gov/analogs-focus-group/

If you would like to be added to the NASA / SSERVI Analogs Focus Group
email list to receive seminar connection and other Analog Focus Group
information, please email jennifer.heldmann@nasa.gov.

2021 NASA PLANETARY SCIENCE SUMMER SCHOOL APPLICATIONS DUE APRIL 1

Offered by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, CA, PSSS is a
3-month long career development experience to learn the development of
a hypothesis-driven robotic space mission in a concurrent engineering
environment while getting an in-depth, first-hand look at mission
design, life cycle, costs, schedule and the trade-offs inherent in
each.

Science and engineering doctoral candidates, recent Ph.D.s, postdocs,
and junior faculty who are U.S. Citizens or legal permanent residents
(and a very limited number of Foreign Nationals from non-designated
counties) are eligible. Applicants from diverse backgrounds are
particularly encouraged to apply.

Session 1: May 24-Aug 6
Session 2: May 24-Aug 20

With workload of a rigorous 3-hour graduate-level course, participants
spend the first 10 weeks in preparatory webinars acting as a science
mission team, & spend the final culminating week mentored by JPL's
Advance Project Design Team to refine their planetary science mission
concept design and present it to a mock expert review board. The
culminating week is typically at JPL, however in 2021 it is likely to
be virtual due to Covid-19 pandemic conditions.

observations, and continue to operate despite COVID-19. Proposals are
invited on any topic broadly related to Solar System or exoplanet
observations. The short proposals (max 3 pages) can be submitted at any
time; decisions on funding are made on a bi-monthly basis.

Further details on the call and on how to apply can be found at the
call website:

Our telescope table holds a broad range of information and contact
data on all the facilities in the network. 

https://bit.ly/31zYpa1

To apply, please contact the relevant facilities first, agree on
observing time, and then submit your funding proposal. If you have
further questions on the call or if you are interested in organizing a
coordinated observations campaign that would like to make use of the
Europlanet Telescope Network, please contact na2@europlanet-society.org

The US National Science Foundation is supporting an Arecibo Observatory
Options Workshop, titled An Interactive Workshop to Explore Novel Ideas
for Future Scientific, Educational, and Cultural Activities with the
Arecibo Observatory, that is "focused on finding actionable and
innovative ways to support, broaden, and strengthen the radio science
community across Puerto Rico and to create or enhance the opportunities
for scientific, educational and cultural activities and public outreach
at the Arecibo Observatory. All are welcome, and participants at
universities, colleges, and non-academic organizations, such as museums
(etc.), in Puerto Rico are particularly encouraged to contribute."
 
The workshop is open to anyone, not just US folks. If you are
interested in participating, the link to information is here:

VIRTUAL CONFERENCE: APPLICATIONS OF STATISTICAL METHODS AND MACHINE
LEARNING IN THE SPACE SCIENCES

Space Science Institute, Boulder, CO, is hosting this virtual
conference May 17-21, 2021. The goal of this conference is to bring
together academia and industry to leverage the advancements in
statistics, data science, methods of artificial intelligence (AI) such
as machine learning and deep learning, and information theory to
improve the analytic models and their predictive capabilities making
use of the enormous data in the field of space sciences.

Conceived as a multidisciplinary gathering, this conference welcomes
researchers from all disciplines of space science, AI, statistics, data
science, and industry who make use of statistical analysis and methods
of AI.

The conference will be fully virtual, given the pandemic, and will
consist of invited and contributed talks, and designated discussion
sessions.

There are limited funds for waiving the registration fee for
students and early careers. Please indicate if you are requesting
registration fee waiver when you submit your abstracts.

Abstract submission opens February 15, closes March 31.
