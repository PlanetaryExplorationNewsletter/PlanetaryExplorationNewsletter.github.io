[NASA] PROPOSED NEW LANGUAGE ON INCLUSION, DIVERSITY, EQUITY AND 
ACCESSIBILITY FOR AOS

Inclusion is a NASA core value. The Science Mission Directorate (SMD)
is committed to a culture of inclusion, diversity, equity, and
accessibility (IDEA) where all employees feel welcome, valued,
respected, and engaged. NASA expects that IDEA will be reflected in the
composition of all Announcement of Opportunity (AO) proposal teams.

NASA announced a Request for Information (RFI) via NSPIRES that seeks
comments/responses from the public on the draft language that NASA
intends to add to SMD's Standard AO Template, all future stand-alone
SMD AOs, and the SALMON-3 AO. The full text of SMD's IDEA RFI, proposed
new AO language, and response instructions can be found at:

https://go.nasa.gov/3xSsOP1

RFI responses must be submitted via NSPIRES by November 3.

Please send questions by October 22, 11:59 EDT to:

Dr. Michael H. New (michael.h.new@nasa.gov) and/or Dr. Cindy L. Daniels
(cindy.l.daniels@nasa.gov)

Responses may be on an individual basis or in a Q&A at:

https://go.nasa.gov/3xSsOP1

Do not send RFI responses to these email addresses; they will not be
considered.

Please read the RFI before emailing:

LPI SEEKING IDEA ADVISORY COMMITTEE MEMBERS

The Lunar and Planetary Institute (LPI) is seeking committee members
for its newly-established IDEA (Inclusion, Diversity, Equity, and
Accessibility) Independent Advisory Committee. The goal of the advisory
committee is to provide guidance on LPI's practices, in particular for
meetings, conferences, and public and planetary community engagement
activities. Service on the committee will be supported through an
honorarium. To apply, please submit a cover letter (up to two pages)
and brief CV (up to two pages) highlighting your experience and

NASA AMES LEGACY MARS GLOBAL CLIMATE MODEL (GCM) TUTORIAL

The Mars Climate Modeling Center at NASA Ames Research Center will host
a virtual modeling tutorial November 2-4, 2021. The tutorial aims to
teach new users how to use and analyze output from the NASA Ames Legacy
Mars Global Climate Model (GCM). The tutorial will include lectures
and hands-on sessions with the goal of teaching participants about the
basic physics in the model, its subroutines and flow diagrams, how to
make changes to the code, how to compile and run the model, and how to
analyze model output. Students, teachers, and researchers with a range
of numerical modeling experience are encouraged to participate, but
some coding proficiency with FORTRAN and Python is strongly encouraged.

SUBMISSIONS SOLICITED FOR NEW RESEARCH TOPIC IN FRONTIERS

A new Research Topic titled "Sources and Propagation of Ultra-Low
Frequency Waves in Planetary Magnetospheres" is now open for
submissions to the Space Physics sections of the journals Frontiers in
Physics and Frontiers in Astronomy and Space Sciences. ULF waves are
ubiquitous in plasma environments in our Solar System. This Research 
Topic will cover the broad spectrum of ULF wave physics, from sources 
to interaction with the surrounding particle populations. 

We hope that you will consider submitting a manuscript.

This Research Topic examples:
- Detailed case studies of all types of ULF waves, such as
  Kelvin-Helmholtz waves, mirror modes, foreshock waves, field-line
  resonances, at Earth and other planets.
- Statistical studies of ULF waves and their relationship with upstream
  conditions.
- Investigations of ULF wave transmission across different plasma
  regions, using multi-spacecraft data analysis and/or global
  simulations.
- Investigations of the impact of ULF waves on the surrounding plasma
  and their contribution to radiation belt dynamics.
- Comparative studies of ULF waves in different environments in our
  Solar System.

In addition to original research, we also invite reviews and
perspectives addressing these topics.

JPL OPEN POSITION: SCIENTIST, LUNAR SEISMOLOGIST

The Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, invites
applications for a newly created research position in the Planetary
Interiors and Geophysics Group. The research will involve lunar
seismology, specifically working with existing lunar seismic data, and
interpreting highly scattered signals. The researcher will refine
science requirements and define basic data processing and archiving
processes for the upcoming Farside Seismic Suite (FSS). They will also
perform detailed computational modeling of highly scattered lunar
seismic data and compare to existing Apollo seismic data in order to
refine techniques for extracting observations to constrain the lunar
interior. They will prepare for future mission opportunities by
investigating both single-station and networked approaches to locating
lunar seismicity and formulating the scientific requirements for future
terrestrial planet missions that contain a seismologic element.

Applicants should have a well-established record in lunar seismology. 
It is expected that the successful candidate will develop an 
independently funded research program.
