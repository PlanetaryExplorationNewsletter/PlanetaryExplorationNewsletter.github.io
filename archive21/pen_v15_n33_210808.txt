NASA EXPANDS ACCESS TO PLANET DATA TO NSF AND ALL FEDERAL CIVILIAN 
AGENCIES

NASA has expanded their contract with Planet via the Commercial 
SmallSat Data Acquisition (CSDA) Program to provide access to 
PlanetScope imagery for scientific research use for all U.S. Federal 
Civilian researchers and National Science Foundation funded 
researchers, including their contractors and grantees. This expands 
access on the existing contract that currently supports NASA and NASA 
funded researchers.

[NASA] PDS: MARS SCIENCE LABORATORY RELEASE 27

The NASA Planetary Data System announces Release 27 of data from the 
Mars Science Laboratory (Curiosity) mission. This release contains raw 
and calibrated data products covering the time period from November 7, 
2020, through March 24, 2021 (sols 2935-3068). The data are archived 
at various PDS nodes:

 - APXS (Alpha Particle X-ray Spectrometer) at the Geosciences Node
 - ChemCam at the Geosciences Node
 - CheMin at the Geosciences Node
 - DAN at the Geosciences Node
 - Engineering Cameras at the Cartography and Imaging Sciences Node
 - MAHLI (Mars Hand Lens Imager) at the Cartography and Imaging 
   Sciences Node
 - Mastcam at the Cartography and Imaging Sciences Node
 - PLACES Database at the Cartography and Imaging Sciences Node
 - RAD (Radiation Assessment Detector) at the PPI Node
 - REMS (Rover Environmental Monitoring Station) at the Atmospheres 
   Node
 - SAM (Sample Analysis at Mars) at the Geosciences Node
 - SPICE at the NAIF Node

The data may be accessed from:

https://pds-geosciences.wustl.edu/missions/msl/

or for a dataset-oriented perspective:

https://pds.nasa.gov/datasearch/subscription-service/SS-20210802.shtml

The next MSL release is scheduled for December 6, 2021.

[NASA] ROSES-21: C.29 MARS SCIENCE LABORATORY PARTICIPATING SCIENTIST 
PROGRAM

The purpose of the Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) Participating 
Scientist (PS) program is to enhance the scientific return from the 
mission by broadening participation in the mission and mission 
operations. The program solicits new investigations that broaden 
and/or complement the funded Principal Investigator (PI)-led 
instrument investigations, thus maximizing the contribution of MSL to 
the future exploration and scientific understanding of Mars. 
Participating Scientist proposals may include instrument-specific or 
multi-instrument investigations and, in all cases, must include both 
science analysis and an operational component (commitment to 
participate in daily operations).

Proposals to this program will be taken by a two-step process in which 
the Notice of Intent is replaced by a required Step-1 proposal 
submitted by an organization Authorized Organizational Representative. 
Step-2 proposals submitted to this program element will be evaluated 
using dual-anonymous peer review. Proposals must be prepared following 
the guidelines in this program element and the "Guidelines for 
Anonymous Proposals" document under "Other Documents" on the NSPIRES 
page for this program element.

Step-1 proposals are due September 15, 2021, and Step-2 proposals are 
due November 5, 2021.

[NASA] ROSES-21: LUNAR DATA ANALYSIS PROGRAM FOCUS ON LUNAR SCIENCE

The Lunar Data Analysis Program (LDAP) funds research on the analysis 
of data from lunar missions for lunar science investigations. The 
overall objectives of LDAP are to: enhance the scientific return of 
lunar missions; broaden scientific participation in the analysis of 
lunar mission data sets; and fund high-priority areas of research 
that support planning for future lunar missions

ROSES-2021 Amendment 28 specifies that proposed investigations are 
limited to lunar science. Moreover, other trivial changes were made to 
the text. New text is in bold and deleted text has been struck 
through. The due dates are unchanged; Step-1 proposals are due 
December 1, 2021, and Step-2 proposals are due February 24, 2022.

On or about August 3, 2021, this Amendment to the NASA Research 
Announcement "Research Opportunities in Space and Earth Sciences 
(ROSES) 2021" (NNH21ZDA001N) will be posted on the NASA research 
opportunity homepage at:

https://solicitation.nasaprs.com/ROSES2021

and will appear on SARA's ROSES blog at:

https://science.nasa.gov/researchers/sara/grant-solicitations/roses-2021/

[NASA] JOB ANNOUNCEMENT FOR MULTIPLE PROGRAM EXECUTIVES IN THE MARS 
SAMPLE RETURN PROGRAM OFFICE

The Mars Sample Return Program within the Science Mission Directorate 
(SMD) at NASA Headquarters (HQ) in Washington, DC is seeking engineers 
highly experienced in management and execution of agency aerospace 
programs to serve as Program Executives. The Mars Sample Return 
Program is one of the most complex, challenging, and impactful 
robotic spaceflight programs in the history of the Agency, with work 
being performed at several NASA Field Centers.

STUDY ON DIVERSITY, EQUITY, AND INCLUSION IN COMPETED SPACE MISSIONS

The National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (NASEM) 
has contracted with NORC at the University of Chicago (NORC) to 
implement an important research study to understand the factors that 
impede or facilitate diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility 
in the proposed leadership for competed space missions at NASA.

We are looking for potential key informants, who have served as 
Principal Investigator (PI) on at least one proposal for a competed 
space mission from 2010 to the present, who would be willing to 
participate in a discussion around the processes for preparing and 
submitting a mission proposal to NASA, and elements of the mission 
proposal process that may present barriers or are facilitators for 
achieving diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility.

Participation in this study will comprise a 45-60-minute virtual 
discussion with an interviewer from NORC. All interview responses will 
be kept confidential and stored separately from your contact 
information, and NORC will not share your contact information or 
interview responses with anyone outside our study team.

If you are interested in participating in the study, please complete 
this short Study Eligibility Survey by August 20, 2021:
