AN OPEN LETTER TO PLANETARY SCIENCE CONFERENCE ORGANIZERS 

We wish to call the planetary science community's attention to this
open letter addressed to USRA, LPI and all other institutions and
colleagues who serve as conference organizers, from members of the
community who are deeply concerned by the issues that led to the use of
incorrect names for some colleagues presenting at LPSC 2021, and
prevented other colleagues from being able to register for the meeting:

https://sites.google.com/view/planetary-sci-conf-org-letter

Despite the responsiveness of colleagues at LPI in addressing some of
the issues, we remain troubled by the disproportionate harm to members
of our community who are already marginalized, and recommend actions to
make sure that such circumstances do not reoccur.

We welcome signatures (through the signature form accompanying the
letter at the link above) from all colleagues who wish to express
support for the contents of the letter.

Parvathy Prem (on behalf of letter authors)

DUAL-ANONYMOUS PEER REVIEW TOWN HALL FOR PLANETARY AND EXOPLANETS
RESEARCH PROGRAMS
 
On April 28, 2021 at 3 PM Eastern, NASA's Planetary Science Division
(PSD) will host a webinar to discuss the implementation of
Dual-Anonymous Peer Review (DAPR) for the following programs under
ROSES-2021: Cassini Data Analysis Program, Discovery Data Analysis
Program, Exoplanet Research Program, New Frontiers Data Analysis
Program, Lunar Data Analysis Program, and the Mars Data Analysis
Program.

In Dual-Anonymous Peer Review, not only are proposers unaware of the
identity of reviewers, but the reviewers do not have explicit knowledge
of the proposing teams and institutions during the scientific
evaluation of the proposal. The webinar will: (1) discuss the
motivation for switching to dual-anonymous peer review, (2) describe
important changes to proposal writing to be compliant with
dual-anonymous peer review, and (3) explain how dual-anonymous peer
reviews will work.
 
In advance of the webinar, questions may be submitted and upvoted on
at:

ADVISORS NEEDED FOR HIGH SCHOOL RESEARCH PROGRAM
 
The Center for Lunar Science and Exploration (CLSE) is looking for
volunteers to advise a team of high school students participating in
the 2021-2022 Exploration of the Moon and Asteroids by Secondary
Students (ExMASS) program. ExMASS is an academic year-long
lunar/asteroid research program that envelops teams of students, paired
with a scientist, in the process of science. At the end of the year,
teams compete for a chance to present their research during the annual
NASA Exploration Science Forum.
 
ExMASS program goals:

Provide an opportunity for secondary students to engage in multiple
practices of science, foster positive student attitudes towards
science, and enhance student lunar and asteroid science content
knowledge.
 
Advisor time commitment varies; in the past, advisors reported spending
on average 1-3 hours a week communicating with their team. Information
about the expected role of an advisor can be found on the ExMASS
website:

http://www.lpi.usra.edu/exploration/education/hsResearch/mentors_teachers_advisors

The 2021-2022 ExMASS program begins September 1, 2021 and concludes by
May 2022. Advisors will be placed with teams no later than September
30, 2021.

If you are interested in being an advisor, or would like more
information, please contact Andy Shaner (Shaner@lpi.usra.edu).
