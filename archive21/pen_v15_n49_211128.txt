AGU SESSION P24C: ULTRAVIOLET OBSERVING OF SOLAR SYSTEM TARGETS

Tuesday, 14 December 2021 14:30-15:45 CST
Please join us for this dynamic panel discussion!

https://agu.confex.com/agu/fm21/meetingapp.cgi/Session/134994

Ultraviolet spectroscopy and imaging have a decades-long history as
valuable techniques for studying atmospheres, aurorae, plumes and
surface composition and volatiles on asteroids, comet nuclei and moons.
While there continue to be opportunities for UV remote sensing from
Earth orbit and in future robotic missions, the infrastructure for UV
instrumentation is at a crossroads. Existing orbital facilities are
nearing the end of their useful lives and there continue to be many
phenomena that cannot be effectively studied with existing,
high-heritage instrument designs. Exciting advances in UV-optimized
technologies promise new capabilities that can be incorporated into the
next generation of robotic probes, flexible SmallSat missions, and
large aperture space-based observatories. This session welcomes
abstracts covering UV science results, as well as reports on progress
toward developing new technologies such as UV detectors, high
performance coatings and novel sensor designs.

We hope to see you there, in person or virtually!

AGU SESSION P11A: CARBON ACROSS THE SOLAR SYSTEM

Monday, 13 December 2021 08:00-09:15 CST
We hope to see you at this panel discussion!

https://agu.confex.com/agu/fm21/meetingapp.cgi/Session/134955

Studies of the existence and state of carbonaceous material on Solar
System bodies is at the forefront of planetary research. Samples of
low-albedo asteroid 162173 Ryugu from the Hayabusa2 probe are on Earth
and are being studied beginning in 2021. The OSIRIS-REx space probe has
retrieved samples from low-albedo asteroid 101955 Bennu. As a framework
for these studies, telescopic, laboratory and theoretical studies of
carbon in all its forms have recently snowballed. The 2018 SSERVI
Carbon in the Solar System workshop launched a series of presentations
and discussions at various venues, enabling an information exchange
around the weathering of carbonaceous compounds in response to thermal
processes and irradiation, and what implications these compositions
have for understanding material processing in the Solar System. We will
generate and share ideas to support research of the new samples, along
with studies of carbon, in various forms, at other locations across the
Solar System.

THE 6TH BEIJING EARTH AND PLANETARY INTERIORS SYMPOSIUM (BEPIS)

Dear Colleagues,

This is a brief notice to announce that the BEPIS will be held in
August 2022. The talks will be given online and/or at the Institute of
Geology and Geophysics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China.

BEPIS focuses on observations and theoretical advances in paleo-, geo-,
bio-, and rock magnetism, geodynamo theories and models, as well as
planetary magnetism, with a primary aim of further understanding the
origin, structure, and variations of Earth and planetary magnetic
fields. Further details will be posted soon on the meeting website:

https://bepis2022.casconf.cn/

If you have questions, please do not hesitate to contact Professor
Chenglong Deng (cldeng@mail.iggcas.ac.cn).

We cordially invite friends, old and new, to participate in the
BEPIS2022.

All the best,
Yongxin Pan, Keke Zhang, Chenglong Deng, Rixiang Zhu

FORMING AND EXPLORING HABITABLE WORLDS

Meeting dates: 7-13 November 2022
Location: Edinburgh with an optional retreat to Stirlingshire
Abstract and early registration deadline: 15 April 2022

https://www.habitableworlds.co.uk

The inaugural Forming and Exploring Habitable Worlds meeting is a
multi-discipline, week-long, international scientific meeting for the 
exchange of new interdisciplinary findings and ideas relating to two 
principal themes:

1) The origins of habitable bodies in and beyond our home Solar System.

2) The motivation for and current status of priorities for space
exploration and its governance. 

This meeting is to accommodate - with generous spacing for reasons of
COVID safety - roughly 120 in-person delegates of all career stages
based in a range of relevant employment sectors. A hybrid model is
envisaged to be delivered so as to broaden participation by
accommodating virtual attendance of additional delegates. The welcoming
atmosphere of this modest-sized event will foster friendly scientific
exchange and shall help to promote networking beneficial to early, mid,
and senior career planetary scientists, space lawyers, educators, and
space technology / mission innovators. Students and those in their
early careers are particularly encouraged to attend and contribute
their work in this friendly, relatively unintimidating, and specialist
gathering.

EGU22 CALL FOR ABSTRACTS PS9.1: ATMOSPHERES AND EXOSPHERES OF
TERRESTRIAL PLANETS, SATELLITES, AND EXOPLANETS

EGU22 will be held in Vienna on 3-8 April 2022.

Please, consider submitting an abstract to the EGU22 Session PS9.1:
"Atmospheres and Exospheres of Terrestrial Planets, Satellites, and
Exoplanets"

Go to:

https://meetingorganizer.copernicus.org/EGU22/session/44231

The deadline for the abstract submission is 12 January 2022, 13:00 CET
or, for those applying for EGU travel support, 1 December 2021.

This session primarily focuses on the neutral atmospheres of
terrestrial bodies other than the Earth. This includes not only Venus
and Mars, but also exoplanets with comparable envelopes and satellites
carrying dense atmospheres such as Titan or exospheres such as
Ganymede. We welcome contributions dealing with processes affecting the
atmospheres of these bodies, from the surface to the exosphere. We
invite abstracts concerning observations, both from Earth or from
space, modeling and theoretical studies, or laboratory work.
Comparative planetology abstracts will be particularly appreciated.

Hope to see you in Vienna!

With best regards,

The conveners Arianna Piccialli, Arnaud Beth and Audrey Vorburger

Space Center (Dr. Tanya Peretyazhko) and Illinois State Geological
Survey (Dr. Martin Pentrak) is seeking a highly motivated Ph.D. student
for an interdisciplinary project in planetary mineralogy/geochemistry
and astrobiology. The project, funded by NASA, aims to study the
transformation of phyllosilicate minerals under Mars-relevant
conditions and determine the mechanisms by which phyllosilicates
transform under a wide range of environmental conditions. The ideal
candidate should have an excellent background in clay mineralogy and be
familiar with X-ray diffraction, infrared and Raman spectroscopies, and
general wet laboratory techniques.
