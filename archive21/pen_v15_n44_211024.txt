POSTODOCTORAL RESEARCHER OPENING

The Laboratory for Agnostic Biosignatures (LAB) - a NASA-funded project 
consisting of 15 investigators at 7 institutions - seeks applicants for 
a postdoctoral fellowship in astrobiology, with a focus on life 
detection. The LAB Project is developing techniques to detect life in 
the universe that humans can't conceive of. The LAB team includes 
biologists, chemists, computer scientists, mathematicians, and 
instrument engineers. Together, these scientific disciplines aim to 
define potential extraterrestrial biosignatures, or signs of life, by 
imagining beyond the molecular framework and underlying biochemistry of 
the only life we know of here on Earth. The team is designing tools and 
techniques for detecting these signatures as well as strategies for 
interpreting them, with the aim of advancing the in situ search for 
life on Mars, Titan, Enceladus, Europa and other bodies within our 
Solar System.  

A postdoctoral scientist is sought to work on testing disequilibrium 
energy-transfer biosignatures using electrochemical methods. The 
postdoc will utilize a suite of electrochemical techniques to produce a 
robust set of electrochemical criteria that can be used to 
differentiate between biological and abiotic electrochemical 
reactions. These reactions are the basis of energy production in all 
known life, perhaps in any environment.

LUNAR EXPLORATION ETHICS PANEL

The Organizing Committee of NextGen is hosting a Lunar Exploration 
Ethics Panel: "How do we create a sustainable and ethical long-term 
presence on the surface of the Moon?" on Tuesday November 2, 2021 at 
12 PM EDT (9 AM PDT / 4 PM GMT) via Zoom. The event's expected duration 
is 1.5 hours. Go to:

https://www.nextgenlunar.space

With the Artemis program, NASA is planning on returning humans to the 
Moon's surface and establishing a base camp in the near future. This 
panel aims to tackle the ethical, sociopolitical, environmental, and 
cultural implications of humans attempting to maintain a sustained 
presence on the surface of the Moon. The panel will allow early career 
lunar scientists and engineers to discuss with experts how they can 
help shape the future of lunar exploration to be more sustainable, 
ethical, and inclusive.

Panelists: Anuradha Damale (she/her); Michelle Hanlon (she/her); AJ 
Link (he/him); Natalie Trevino (she/her)

More information about the panel and panelists, including a link to 
register for the event can be found on our website:

POSTDOC IN RADIATION CHEMISTRY/ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY RELATED TO THE 
JOVIAN ICY SATELLITES

The Centre d'Etudes sur les Ions, les Materiaux et la Photoniques 
(CIMAP) in Caen, France, and Laboratoire de Chimie Organique et 
Bioorganique, Reactivite et Analyse (COBRA), Rouen, France, are looking 
for a 24-months postdoctoral researcher, starting January 2022.

The postdoc will work on the formation under high vacuum and 
irradiation (with athe lines of the National Large Particle Accelerator 
GANIL in Caen, France) of ice samples to investigate the organic 
chemistry induced by radiation processes on the surface of Jovian 
satellites. They will also analyze the organic matter resulting from 
these experiments with a multi-techniques approach including FT-IR 
spectroscopy and Ultra-High Resolution Mass Spectrometry.

The project involves close collaboration with Aix-Marseille Universite 
and its recently created Institut des Origines on the planetary 
application aspects.

A strong background either in vacuum system and laboratory irradiation 
experiment or analytical chemistry is desired. Application examination 
is ongoing and a decision is expected by mid November 2021. Send a CV, 
list of publications, and short description of past research work to 
the email addresses below.
