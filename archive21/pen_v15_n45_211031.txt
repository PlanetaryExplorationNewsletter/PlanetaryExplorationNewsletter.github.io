NASA JPL JOB OPENING: DEPUTY PROJECT SCIENTIST, EUROPA CLIPPER

Location: Pasadena, CA

The Science Division of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) and the 
Europa Clipper Project, managed for NASA by JPL, seek a Deputy Project 
Scientist for the development, cruise operations, and tour operations 
phases of the Europa Clipper mission. The purpose of the Europa 
Clipper mission is to investigate the habitability of Jupiter's moon, 
Europa. This mission seeks to address the NASA's strategic science 
goal of ascertaining the potential for life elsewhere in the Solar 
System by investigating the capacity of Europa and its deep ocean to 
harbor life. The mission is currently in its final system design and 
fabrication phase, toward a planned launch in October 2024, arrival at 
Jupiter in 2030, and first encounter with Europa in 2031; the nominal 
end of prime mission is 2034. The successful candidate will be a 
highly motivated individual with previous direct mission experience 
and broad planetary science expertise.

BIOSIGNATURE STANDARDS OF EVIDENCE WHITEPAPER NOW AVAILABLE FOR PUBLIC 
COMMENT AND CO-SIGNING

Dear Astrobiology Community,

In July, 2021 the Nexus for Exoplanet System Science (NExSS) and the 
Network for Life Detection (NfoLD) Research Coordination Networks 
hosted a community workshop on Biosignature Standards of Evidence. 
During this workshop, participants developed a generalized framework 
for biosignature detection and assessment, and discussed and 
identified best practices needed to develop a reporting protocol for 
potential biosignature detection. 

The participants have now completed a draft whitepaper report 
summarizing the workshop discussions and major findings. The white 
paper sections describe the motivation for community development of 
biosignature assessment and reporting protocols, a description of the 
generalized assessment framework, worked examples of how the framework 
could be applied for specific biosignatures and measurement 
techniques, a discussion of how the framework can be applied 
throughout a spaceflight mission life cycle, discussions on the 
reporting protocol development, and a summary of key takeaways and 
future work.

The workshop participants are now soliciting community comments and 
offering members of the scientific community the opportunity to 
co-sign the whitepaper on this website:

https://www.nfold.org/soe-endorsements

The comment period will close on November 10th.

FRONTIER DEVELOPMENT LAB (FDL): CALL FOR CHALLENGES

FDL is a public private partnership between NASA, the SETI Institute, 
Trillium Technologies and commercial AI, space and Earth science. FDL 
applies AI technologies to science to push frontiers and develop new 
tools to solve challenges that are important to NASA's goals - and all 
Humankind.

FDL is inviting academic researchers and research focused 
organizations to submit applied AI challenge opportunities for 
consideration for the FDL 2022 research cycle. The goal of this open 
solicitation is for researchers with applied AI ideas to engage with 
FDL's ML researcher and partner community. We're looking for applied 
AI challenge concepts from the space and Earth science which extend 
and build on the broad research themes of previous FDLs (e.g. Lunar 
exploration, Heliophysics, Earth Science, Planetary Defense, 
Astrobiology, Disaster Response, Mission Operations and Exploration 
Medicine) - although we are happy to hear ideas in adjacent or related 
domains. All FDL research is conducted in the spirit of open science.

The closing date for challenge submission is November 7, 2021, 
Midnight AoE (anywhere on Earth).

To learn more about our Open Solicitation process please visit the FDL 
website at:

[NASA] SMD SEEKS VOLUNTEER REVIEWERS

New Volunteer Reviewer Opportunities Posted

NASA's Science Mission Directorate is seeking subject matter experts 
to serve as external (email) and/or virtual panel reviewers of 
proposals to the "ROSES" research solicitation. All of the reviewer 
volunteer forms may be accessed from the landing page at:

https://science.nasa.gov/researchers/volunteer-review-panels

or just follow the links below to the individual forms. Once there, 
click the boxes to indicate the topics in which you consider yourself 
to be a subject matter expert. If your skills match our needs for that 
review and there are not too many organizational conflicts of 
interest, we will contact you to discuss scheduling.

20 volunteer reviewer forms are currently open and new forms posted 
this month include:

- SERVIR Applied Sciences Team
- Terrestrial Ecology: Arctic-Boreal Vulnerability Experiment (ABoVE) 
  Phase 3
- EnVision VenSAR Science Team
- Payloads and Research Investigations on the Surface of the Moon (now 
  with Space Biology topics)

POSTDOCTORAL SCHOLAR IN PLANETARY SCIENCE AT TEXAS A&M

We are seeking a postdoctoral researcher to work on the application 
and development of automated boulder-detection software. Working with 
the software will require experience and proficiency working with 
large datasets, Python code, and GIS platforms. Applicants must have 
interest and experience working with remote sensing data, large 
datasets, and statistics.

Applicants will be expected to assist in the production of data for a 
NASA Mars Data Analysis Program grant. This work will require manual 
mapping of surface features as well as the production and 
interpretation of automated mapping results. The mapping results will 
be used to interpret potentially ongoing surface processes in the 
northern lowlands of Mars related to boulder production and ice-driven 
surface motion. In addition, applicants will be expected to assist in 
writing scientific papers and conference presentations related to the 
work.

Time Frame: As Soon as Possible - August 2023
