ROCK, DUST AND ICE: INTERPRETING PLANETARY DATA
 
How can we leverage multi-wavelength observations, radiative transfer
theory and laboratory work to characterize planetary solids? This 4-day
virtual workshop will bring together observers, modelers and laboratory
astronomers to discuss the interpretation of observations of rocks,
ices and dust on and around Solar System objects. A large variety of
complementary observational techniques will be featured, via invited
and contributed presentations, as well as different methods to
constrain solids' fundamental properties such as composition, porosity,
thermal inertia and grain size distribution. The workshop is organized
by the SOFIA Science Center, and a special emphasis will be put on mid-
and far-IR data. Each daily 3-hour session will include ample time for
moderated interdisciplinary discussions. The fourth day will be
dedicated to a moderated discussion on databases, archives and public
codes.

We welcome attendance from scientists at any career level, especially
early career scientists. Attendees are encouraged to submit
contributions for posters and short talks, with an abstract submission
deadline of March 9, 2021. Registration is free but necessary to
attend.

JOINT NASA EXPLORATION SCIENCE FORUM/EUROPEAN LUNAR SYMPOSIUM

SSERVI and its European partner organizations are proud to announce the
NASA Exploration Science Forum and European Lunar Symposium, to be held
jointly July 13-16, 2021 as a virtual meeting. This conference will
bring together scientists from around the world to focus on science
which enables human exploration, and science enabled by human
exploration.

With NASA's Artemis program and its partners from Europe and around the
globe, coupled with the developing lunar industry and other missions
from NASA and international space agencies, the opportunity for a new
generation of lunar science experiments to probe our nearest neighbor
has never been greater. This joint conference will explore current and
future plans and share new, exciting results in a wide range of fields
encompassing exploration science.

Another announcement will be sent prior to the end of February when
abstract submission is open, with the website and abstract due date.

Conference Co-Chairs:
Greg Schmidt (Director, SSERVI)
Mahesh Anand (The Open University, UK)

AOGS 2021 SESSION: ST/PS-03 MAGNETIC FLUX ROPE THROUGHOUT THE SOLAR
SYSTEM

At the 18th Annual AOGS 2021 virtual meeting held between August 1-6,
2021, we will convene a session titled: "ST/PS-03 Magnetic
Flux Rope Throughout the Solar System".

https://www.asiaoceania.org/aogs2021/public.asp?page=home.html

We invite abstracts that address a wide range of topics on the
fundamental physics of magnetic flux ropes from the solar atmosphere to
the magnetospheres of Earth and planets (inner and outer planets,
including Venus and Mars) using spacecraft observations, theoretical
analysis, and numerical simulations. Magnetic flux rope is one of the
most fundamental magnetic structures in space plasma physics and are
ubiquitous in the Solar System. They can exist in a wide range of
spatial scales, from tens-of-million km coronal mass ejection in
interplanetary space, to tens-of-thousands km flux transfer events and
plasmoid-type flux ropes in global/induced planetary magnetospheres,
down to the electron inertial scale length magnetic islands forming
during the early stages of reconnection in thin current sheets. Despite
having been extensively studied using classical plasma theory,
numerical simulations and observations, many aspects of magnetic flux
ropes remain unexplored, primarily their origins, dynamics (e.g.
plasmoid instability) and their effects on field-aligned current
generation, energetic particle acceleration and thermal plasma
transport.

GOLDSCHMIDT SESSION 1E: SUBSURFACE OCEANS OF ICY BODIES BEYOND EARTH -
COMPOSITION, EVOLUTION, AND EXCHANGE PROCESSES
 
Please consider submitting an abstract to the ocean world session at
Goldschmidt 2021, taking place on July 4-9. The session will be
virtual. The last year has taught us how to carry out a great session,
inviting lots of discussion. The deadline for submissions is February
26.
 
Conveners: Mark Fox-Powell, Mohit Melwani Daswani
Keynote: Yasuhito Sekine (ELSI)
Invited Speaker: Christine Ray (SWRI)
 
In the next decade, a new generation of missions aims to increase our
knowledge of ocean worlds. Many fundamental questions remain
unanswered, e.g.,: how do ocean and ice shell compositions evolve over
geologic time? What core-ocean or ocean-surface exchange processes are
presently active? And what tracers of subsurface (bio)geochemistry
might be encountered by spacecraft? We invite contributions addressing
these and other topics relating to subsurface oceans. Our aim is to
foster a highly interdisciplinary forum. We welcome submissions from
modelling studies, laboratory experiments, observations, interpretation
of existing mission data, preparation for new missions, investigations
of natural analogues, etc. Such a coordinated cross-disciplinary
approach is required to support upcoming missions and develop a
systems-level understanding of ocean worlds.

INDEPENDENT REVIEW BOARD (IRB) FOR THE PLANETARY DATA ECOSYSTEM (PDE)

The NASA Planetary Science Division (PSD) has established an
Independent Review Board (IRB) for the Planetary Data Ecosystem (PDE),
defined as the ad hoc connected framework of activities and products
that are built upon and support the data collected by planetary space
missions and research programs which are primarily NASA funded. The
IRB is conducting a review of the PDE with the goal of defining the
full environment, identifying missing or overly redundant elements, and
providing findings and prioritized, actionable recommendations for
PSD's long-term planning in support of the PDE.

The PDE IRB will hold open meetings on February 23 and 24 (11am-2pm EST
both days) to discuss preliminary findings and recommendations; and on
March 2 from 1-3pm EST to present preliminary findings on the PDS. The
community is invited to attend any of these meetings as observers (but
not as participants). The meetings may be joined by using this link or
dial-in number:

EARLY CAREER SCIENTIST SPOTLIGHTS - NASA GODDARD SPACE FLIGHT CENTER
 
Would you like to learn about the early career researchers currently
working at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC)? Check out the first
dozen Early Career Scientist Spotlight (ECSS) articles, published here:

https://science.gsfc.nasa.gov/600/ECSS/index.html

ECSS articles are posted monthly and showcase the research interests,
science motivations, and achievements of early career scientists at
NASA GSFC. The ECSS project was initiated to facilitate networking
during the pandemic. With almost all current communication limited to
virtual interactions, it may be a challenge to keep in touch with
colleagues and make new research connections - two very important
aspects of having a successful career in research!

The primary goal of the ECSS project is to increase the visibility of
the Goddard early career scientists both locally and to the broader
scientific community. Please feel free to share the featured articles
with your colleagues!

ASTROMETRY REQUEST FOR TNO OBSERVERS

Following the successful exploration of the Pluto system and the
classical TNO Arrokoth, new spacecraft mission concepts are being
studied to again target dwarf planets and minor bodies of the
trans-Neptunian region. One such concept is the Interstellar Probe,
currently being studied by the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics
Laboratory (APL), to explore the outer heliosphere and the local
interstellar medium, and it could include a planetary flyby. The
following TNO dwarf planets are considered high-priority exploration
targets:

2002 MS4; Eris; Gonggong (2007 OR10); Ixion; Orcus; Pluto; Quaoar;
Sedna; Varda; Varuna
 
Due to the fast speed of an Interstellar Probe, and thus the difficulty
in changing trajectories en route, it is imperative that orbit
solutions for these potential targets be well-constrained by the
potential start of a mission in the early 2030s. To this end, we ask
you to consider the following: 

(1) Process imaging data in-hand and submitting astrometry to the Minor
Planet Center (MPC). 

(2) Image these targets as back-up observations for your future
observing programs.

Astrometry from occultations are high-priority measurements.
