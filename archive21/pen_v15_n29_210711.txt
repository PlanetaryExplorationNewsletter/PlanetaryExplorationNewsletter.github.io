VEXAG VIRTUAL COLLOQUIUM SERIES ANNOUNCEMENT

VEXAG is excited to announce the establishment of a new and ongoing 
virtual colloquium series: Second Planet (Second) Tuesday. This talk 
series will focus on a different topic of Venus research and 
exploration each month, with short-form, live talks given mainly by 
early-career students and researchers. The series is intended to 
provide visibility and engagement to the newest members of the Venus 
community while also making Venus research and exploration accessible 
to the public. Each session will feature two guest speakers each 
presenting for ~15 minutes, with questions presented by moderators at 
the end of the scheduled talks. In order to provide a welcoming and 
supportive environment, VEXAG will adopt a code of conduct policy 
similar to other planetary science events (e.g., USRA/LPI), 
interactions between attendees and speakers will be moderated, and 
talks will not be recorded.

Time: 2nd Tuesday of each month at noon (Eastern)

Date: July 13, 2021

Topic: Evidence for Recent or Ongoing Volcanism at Venus' Surface

Speakers: J. Semprich and J. Brossier

AGU SESSION P018: IN SITU SCIENCE AND INSTRUMENTATION FOR THE 
EXPLORATION OF EUROPA AND OCEAN WORLDS

Future landed missions to Europa and other ocean worlds will bring 
significant advances to our understanding of these environments. Such 
in situ exploration will enable biochemical and geophysical 
experiments that cannot be done from orbit and provide important new 
context for earlier remote sensing observations, analysis, and derived 
modeling. This session is intended to bring together 1) proposals for 
scientific experiments to be performed from the surface or subsurface 
of ocean worlds, 2) innovative engineering and instrument approaches 
to surface or subsurface exploration, and 3) landed mission concepts, 
such as Europa Lander. Abstracts covering mission concepts, instrument 
concepts and technologies, supporting laboratory work, and other novel 
in situ surface or subsurface science and implementation topics are 
encouraged, as are abstracts covering planetary protection strategies 
for mitigating risk of forward contamination.

The conveners invite abstracts to be submitted through August 4th:

AGU SESSION P035: THE FUTURE OF PLANETARY ATMOSPHERIC, SURFACE, AND 
INTERIOR SCIENCE USING RADIO AND LASER LINKS

Session ID: 119810   

The deadline for all submissions is Wednesday, August 4, 2021 at 
23:59 EDT.

Radio science has been used by many missions as a tool to study Solar 
System phenomena and fundamental physics. The scope of this session 
includes radio, laser and optical science techniques to study ocean 
worlds, planetary and small body interiors, the dynamics, composition, 
and thermal structure of planetary atmospheres, to characterize the 
topography, scattering, electrical, and other properties of planetary 
surfaces, to study Solar System dynamics and test fundamental physics, 
and to new techniques to combine diverse datasets. Radio science 
investigations motivated by U.S. Planetary Science Decadal Survey white 
papers are of particular interest. Relevant technology topics include 
but are not limited to the design of small spacecraft networks and 
constellations, the use of inter-satellite links, advances in flight 
and ground instrumentation, advances in space clock technologies, novel 
communications architectures including optical links, advances in radio 
and laser technologies, and new techniques and instrumentation for 
entry probes.

AGU SESSION: MULTIDISCIPLINARY PERSPECTIVES ON THE FORMATION AND EARLY 
EVOLUTION OF TERRESTRIAL WORLDS

We encourage contributions that address the early history of rocky 
planets, including geochemistry, cosmochemistry, astronomy, mineral 
physics, petrology, and planetary sciences. The deadline for 
submissions is Wednesday, 4 August 2021.

Accretionary processes are fundamental to our understanding of the 
thermal and compositional evolution of rocky planets in the Solar 
System and beyond. Advances in experiments under extreme P-T 
conditions, theoretical modelling, and observations at a system-level 
are key to unravelling the early history of rocky, potentially 
habitable worlds. Particularly, processes related to planetary 
accretion and evolution, including condensation, impacts, 
(de-)volatilization, atmosphere formation, core-mantle 
differentiation, and climate diversity have been increasingly 
constrained by planetary sample analysis, laboratory experiments, 
theoretical simulations, and astronomical observations of extrasolar 
planetary system. We invite interdisciplinary contributions that 
address various physical and chemical aspects of planetary accretion 
and differentiation, including geochemistry, cosmochemistry, 
astronomy, mineral physics, petrology, and planetary sciences.

URANUS-GRAM RELEASED IN GRAM SUITE VERSION 1.2

The Global Reference Atmospheric Model (GRAM) Suite is an 
engineering-oriented atmospheric model that estimates mean values and 
statistical variations of atmospheric properties for planetary
destinations. GRAM outputs include atmospheric density, temperature, 
pressure, winds, and chemical composition along a user-defined path. 
The GRAMs have been rearchitected from Fortran to a common 
object-oriented C++ framework. This new architecture creates a common 
GRAM library of data models and utilities. Version 1.2 of the GRAM 
Suite contains the new Uranus-GRAM and the rearchitected Neptune-GRAM 
and Titan-GRAM. Uranus-GRAM atmospheric data is from the NASA Ames 
Research Center Uranus Atmospheric Model. GRAM Suite Version 1.2 is
