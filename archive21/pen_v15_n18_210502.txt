[NASA] ROSES-21: DRAFT C.26 ENVISION VENSAR SCIENCE TEAM 
RELEASED FOR COMMUNITY COMMENT

ROSES-2021 Program Element C.26 EnVision VenSAR ST would solicit
proposals for VenSAR team members and a Team Leader over the period of
2021-2026. The nine-member VenSAR Science Team would work with the JPL
project and the broader EnVision mission to provide scientific feedback
into VenSAR development. Of these nine members, approximately seven
members are expected to be from U.S. institutions that will be
supported under NASA awards under this element, and up to two members
are expected to be from institutions located in ESA member states with
support from their own national or other program.

Questions and comments concerning the draft ROSES-2021 C.26 EnVision
VenSAR Science Team should be addressed to Adriana Ocampo at
adriana.c.ocampo@nasa.gov by May 14, 2021.

This Amendment is posted on the NASA research opportunity homepage at: 

http://solicitation.nasaprs.com/ROSES2021 

and will appear on SARA's ROSES blog at:

NASA-FUNDED SCIENTIFIC PAYLOAD FOR THE CANADIAN SPACE AGENCY LUNAR
EXPLORATION ACCELERATOR PROGRAM (LEAP) PHASE A LUNAR ROVER TO BE
DELIVERED BY CLPS

NASA Science Mission Directorate's (SMD) Exploration Science Strategy
and Integration Office (ESSIO) announces an upcoming opportunity for
interested U.S. investigators to provide a U.S. scientific payload to
be integrated onto a Canadian lunar rover. Proposal teams will be led
by Canadian companies and submitted proposals will be evaluated and
selected by the Canadian Space Agency (CSA), with NASA participation.
The rover, carrying one Canadian science payload and one U.S. science
payload, will be delivered by a NASA Commercial Lunar Payload Services
(CLPS) provider to the lunar surface in 2025. It is anticipated that 
this opportunity will be solicited by CSA in late May 2021. Canadian 
rover teams preparing to submit proposals may reach out to U.S. 
institutions to gauge interest in providing an instrument for 
consideration.

Further information regarding this CSA opportunity is included in CSA's
Letter of Interest, available on:

https://buyandsell.gc.ca/procurement-data/tender-notice/PW-ST-048-38561

Questions regarding this opportunity can be directed via email to
debra.m.hurwitz@nasa.gov and (Zachary Pirtle) zpirtle@nasa.gov.

EPSC 2021 SESSION: MARS SCIENCE AND EXPLORATION

Abstract submission open until May 26.

https://tinyurl.com/2cuzhbf9

Conveners: Alejandro Cardesin-Moinelo, Gerhard Kminek, Patrick Martin,
Claire Newman, Elliot Sefton-Nash, Hakan Svedhem, Dmitrij Titov, Jorge
Vago

The aim of this session is to share the knowledge and experience
between all Mars missions in operations and development, including the
3 new missions arrived this year, promoting multi-mission and
multi-disciplinary synergies between the various exploration programs
in Europe and worldwide.

We welcome contributions from any field of Mars science and
exploration, in particular latest scientific results and instrument
overviews for all operational orbiters (Mars Express, ExoMars TGO,
Odyssey, MRO, MAVEN, Mangalyaan/MOM, Tianwen-1, Hope) and surface
assets (MSL, Insight, Mars2020, Tianwen-1), including operational and
technical developments in preparation for the new missions (ExoMars
RSP, MMX, Mars Sample Return and others).

SUMMER SCHOOL IN SOFTWARE SYSTEMS FOR ASTRONOMY

Software Systems for Astronomy (SSfA-8) will again be offered online
this year, and will be spread over 7 weeks, June 21 to July 30, 2021. 
The course covers the design and implementation of software for
telescope and instrument control systems, observation planning tools,
and software for analyzing and archiving astronomical data.

If you are not a University of Hawaii at Hilo (UHH) student, follow the
instructions given at this link:

INSIGHTSEERS PROGRAM APPLICATION OPEN

The InSight team is recruiting a second round of "InSightSeers". This
program is intended to expose early career scientists to the experience
of working on an interplanetary mission team. They will be paired with
a mentor from the science team and allowed to observe all virtual
science team meetings from June 28 - July 2, 2021. We hope that this
will provide valuable insight (ha) into the work and team dynamics that
take place on missions and help early career scientists make informed
decisions about their career paths.

This opportunity is open to graduate students in or beyond their third
year of postgraduate studies (PhD or Master's) and early career
scientists within seven years of receiving their post-graduate degree.
Respondents will be selected based upon the anticipated impact to their
career path and the alignment of their research interests with the
scientific objectives of the mission. InSight recognizes and supports
the benefits of having diverse and inclusive communities and expects
that such values will be reflected in this opportunity. 

Questions to: ingrid_daubar@brown.edu with subject line "InSightSeers". 
For more details and to apply, fill out this form by Friday, May 28:

POSTDOCTORAL ASSOCIATE POSITION AT THE UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND

The Planetary Surfaces and Spacecraft Lab at the University of
Maryland, College Park has one open postdoctoral researcher position.
We are looking for a scholar with strong computational modeling skills
and an interest in the intersection of planetary science and aerospace
engineering. The researcher will work on two projects: 1. modeling
rarefied gas drag on particles ejected from comets and 2. modeling
triboelectric charging of spacecraft interacting with regolith (e.g.
rover wheels on the Moon). An existing experimental teststand will be
used for subsequent validation of the triboelectric modeling. We are
looking for a scholar with prior experience relevant to at least one of
these two projects (e.g., rarefied flows, triboelectric charging, or
granular materials) and/or relevant simulation tools (DSMC or DEM/MD).
The scholar will work with Dr. Christine Hartzell develop new modeling
capabilities using open source software, and present research results
(via conferences and journal publications) to the wider planetary
science and exploration community.

Additional information can be found at:

http://ejobs.umd.edu/postings/82169

Any questions regarding this position should be addressed to Dr. 
Christine Hartzell (hartzell@umd.edu).
