ISSI CALL FOR PROJECT PROPOSALS

The International Space Science Institute (ISSI) in Bern, Switzerland, 
and ISSI-BJ in Beijing, China, invite proposals for establishing 
International Teams to conduct on its premises research activities in 
Space Sciences, based on the interdisciplinary analysis and evaluation 
of data from spacecraft and possible integration with ground data and 
theoretical models. For the purpose of this call, Space Sciences 
include the Solar and Heliospheric Physics, Solar-Terrestrial Sciences, 
Space Plasma and Magnetospheric Physics, Planetary Sciences, 
Astrobiology, Cosmology, Astrophysics, Fundamental Physics in Space, 
and Earth Sciences using Space data.

Letter of Intent: February 14, 2021

Deadline for proposals: March 25, 2021

The Call for International Teams proposal is available on the ISSI 
website:

JWST USER COMMITTEE: CALL FOR NOMINATIONS

The JWST User Committee (JSTUC) is responsible for advising STScI and 
the JWST Project on all aspects of observatory operations. Membership 
is drawn from the U.S, Canadian and ESA communities, and includes 
representatives from the JWST instrument teams. Further information can 
be found at:

https://www.stsci.edu/jwst/science-planning/user-committees/jwst-users-committee

A number of members are rotating off the committee in the coming year, 
and STScI is calling for expressions of interest from community members 
who would like to serve as JSTUC members. Self-nomination is welcome. 
Submissions should include a cover letter and a one-page curriculum 
vitae summarizing the nominee's relevant background and JWST-related 
interests, and should be submitted by e-mail to jstuc@stsci.edu. There 
is no restriction on citizenship. Nominations will be considered 
through April 7, 2021.

[NASA] CASIS RESEARCH ANNOUNCEMENT IN TECHNOLOGY ADVANCEMENTS TO 
LEVERATE THE ISS

The Center for the Advancement of Science in Space (CASIS), manager of 
the International Space Station (ISS) U.S. National Laboratory, made 
public a research announcement soliciting proposals for technology 
advancements and applied research that would utilize the International 
Space Station. CASIS seeks to solicit proposals for flight 
investigations within applied research and development, translational 
medicine, technology readiness level maturation, and technology 
demonstrations.

To learn more about this opportunity, please visit: 

https://www.issnationallab.org/research-on-the-iss/solicitations/nlra2021-3

This webpage includes information on the research announcement, 
including how to submit a Step One Concept Summary. Flight projects 
selected via this research announcement may be awarded funding to 
enable mission integration and operations support for projects that 
will be implemented on the ISS National Lab.

ASTROBIOLOGY POSTDOCTORAL SCHOLAR AT UC BERKELEY

The Space Sciences Laboratory (SSL) at the University of California, 
Berkeley seeks applications for a full-time (100%) Postdoctoral Scholar 
in the area of astrobiology. The anticipated start date for the 
position is between March 1, 2021 and July 1, 2021. For more 
information about the position, including required qualifications 
application materials, and deadlines, go to: 

https://aprecruit.berkeley.edu/JPF02835

The successful applicant will join a dynamic team working on the 
development and optimization of space flight instrumentation and 
methods for the detection of trace organic molecules in solar system 
exploration. The instrument is a microfluidic capillary electrophoresis 
analyzer which sensitively probes for bioorganic molecules. Work is 
conducted jointly at the Berkeley's Space Sciences Lab and Department 
of Chemistry.

For questions, please email: 

Dr. Anna Butterworth (butterworth@berkeley.edu) 
Dr. Richard Mathies (ramathies@berkeley.edu) 

All qualified applicants will receive consideration for employment 
without regard to race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, 
gender identity, national origin, disability, age, or protected veteran 
status.

ROCK, ICE AND DUST: INTERPRETING PLANETARY DATA

March 23-26, 2021

How can we leverage multi-wavelength observations, radiative transfer 
theory and laboratory work to characterize planetary solids? The SOFIA 
Science center and the SOC are excited to invite you to the "Rock, Ice 
and Dust: Interpreting Planetary Data" workshop, which will happen 
online on March 23-26 of this year (8-11 am Pacific Time). The 
objective of this workshop is to bring together observers, modelers and 
laboratory astronomers to discuss the interpretation of observations of 
rocks, ices and dust on and around Solar System objects. The last day 
will be a moderated discussion on the current tools and needs for this 
community.

We solicit contributions for posters and short talks (abstract 
submission deadline: March 9, 2021), and we welcome attendance from 
scientists at any career level, especially early career scientists. 
Registration is free but necessary to attend.
