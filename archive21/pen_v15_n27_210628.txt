INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF THERMOPHYSICS SPECIAL ISSUE

The International Journal of Thermophysics invites articles for a
special issue on "Thermophysics of Advanced Spacecraft Materials and
Extraterrestrial Samples"

In present and future planned planetary exploration space missions,
spacecraft are exposed to a range of extreme thermal environments.

The development of advanced thermal control materials and
devices together with reliable and accurate measure of their
thermophysical properties (spanning cryogenic to high temperatures)
are needed for development of systems designed to meet the
engineering challenges associated with these space missions.

Unmanned probes recently sent to celestial bodies within our solar 
system have either engaged in remote sensing, or sample retrieval and 
return to earth activities for purposes of investigating their 
constituents. Thermophysical properties research on substances 
obtained from celestial bodies and analogue material will provide 
fundamental scientific information regarding the process of evolution 
of the Solar System.

This special issue aims to publish original high-quality research
papers covering the most recent advancements on the topic, as well as
ample reviews addressing space-related topics.

The deadline for article submission is December 31, 2021, and the
announcement can be found at:

NASA BIOLOGICAL AND PHYSICAL SCIENCES DECADAL SURVEY WHITEPAPERS CALL

The NASA Biological and Physical Sciences Decadal Survey Call for 
Whitepapers is now available: 

https://bit.ly/3dhEiE2

We are hoping to get a strong response from the planetary dust-plasma 
community regarding future investigations in microgravity and on the 
Moon's surface.

Topical Whitepapers (e.g. on a single science investigation) are due 
October 31. Research campaign whitepapers (e.g. missions or instrument 
suites costing at least $100M) are due December 23. We have been told 
that the panel will start reviewing whitepapers as soon as they are 
received, so submitting early is advantageous. 

We brainstormed a list of topical whitepapers from the dust-plasma 
community at a meeting last month: 

https://bit.ly/35T2uJ6
 
If you are interested in writing or being a signatory on a whitepaper, 
please see the list and add yourself. Feel free to add more papers if 
your idea isn't already captured on the list. If you are the main 
author of a whitepaper, please get in contact with your coauthors to 
start coordinating. Send questions regarding the spreadsheet to 
Christine Hartzell (hartzell@umd.edu).

ARECIBO OBSERVATORY: US INNOVATION AND COMPETITION ACT

The Arecibo Science Advocacy Partnership (ASAP) is organizing an 
advocacy campaign to encourage Congress to include funding for the 
design and construction of a new Arecibo telescope in the US 
Innovation and Competition Act (Bill S. 1260) that was passed by the 
Senate on June 8, 2021. The bill includes considerable investments in 
research and specifically calls out programs at the NSF and NASA. The 
bill includes topics that could be addressed by a new Arecibo 
telescope (or that were already being addressed at the AO before the 
collapse), including Space Situational Awareness, Planetary Defense, 
Search for Life and programs to address the STEM workforce and STEM 
education.

Read the Bill (select the Engrossed in Senate (6/8/21) version):

https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/senate-bill/1260/text
 
We are asking that you contact your representative and ask them to 
include funding for the design and construction of a new Arecibo 
telescope. Find your Congressional Representative here:

NEW SAMPLES FROM PLANETARY BODIES: COLLECTION AT SCIENTIFIC REPORTS

Scientific Reports is welcoming submissions for a Collection focused 
on  the retrieval and analysis of new samples from planetary bodies. 
The Collection aims to highlight the inter-disciplinary nature of 
this endeavour by bringing together original research across physics, 
biology, and chemistry, focusing on the development of novel 
instrumentation, methodology, and planetary science required to 
retrieve and analyse these samples.

Submissions are being welcomed up until the end of November 2021, but 
if you require more time then feel free to contact the editorial 
office at scirep.collection@springernature.com for late submission 
enquiries or any other questions.

You can find more information about the Collection, and how to submit 
a manuscript here:

RCOP+ICCRE SESSION: PLANETARY PERMAFROST

Abstract submission is open for the 2021 Regional Conference on 
Permafrost (RCOP), which is being run in parallel with the 19th 
International Conference on Cold Regions Engineering (ICCRE), to be 
held October 24-29, 2021 (virtual).

This year's meeting features a planetary permafrost session, which 
welcomes a broad range of perspectives on permafrost across the Solar 
System, including but not limited to remote sensing, scientific 
characterization, future exploration and mission concepts, engineering
criteria and constraints for ISRU, and Earth analog comparisons. A 
major goal of this session is cross-pollination between the planetary 
permafrost community and the Arctic/Antarctic permafrost science and 
engineering community. We encourage both overview presentations that 
can provide the terrestrial community with synthesis of existing 
planetary permafrost research, as well as presentations on specific 
research and applications, from both new and experienced researchers, 
that can serve as the launching point for idea exchange between Earth 
and space-focused teams. Questions can be directed to session chairs 
Ali Bramson (bramsona@purdue.edu) and Joe Levy (jlevy@colgate.edu).

Abstracts are due July 15. For more information about the conference 
and abstract submission, see

AGU SESSION P026: PLANETARY ATMOSPHERES AND EVOLUTION

Conveners: Vladimir Airapetian, Cedric Gillmann, Yasuhito Sekine

We invite oral and poster contributions to advance our understanding 
of the nature and evolution of (exo)planetary atmospheres and its 
impact on habitability.

Understanding the nature and variability of (exo)planetary 
atmospheres, the physical mechanisms governing atmospheric dynamics 
and chemical evolution are strong driving forces of (exo)planetary 
science and Solar System exploration mission planning. While long-term 
Earth evolution is constrained by geological studies and isotopic 
analyses, the evolutionary paths of other planets must be 
reconstructed from data obtained through astronomical observations and 
planetary missions. Models of planetary atmospheres use these 
observations to illuminate physical processes operating from the Earth 
to planets in the Solar System and beyond. Processes that govern the 
interactions of atmospheres with planetary surfaces are an important 
aspect of planetary evolution. The rapidly increasing number of 
discovered exoplanets provides an exciting opportunity for 
interdisciplinary collaborations, between heliophysicists, 
astrophysicists, planetary and climate scientists. This session 
welcomes observational, theoretical, experimental, and field studies 
relevant to physical and chemical evolution of (exo)planetary 
atmospheres and planetary habitability in and outside of our solar 
system. 

Abstract submission deadline: Wednesday, August 4 at 23:59 EDT

AGU SESSION P020: PLANETARY SCIENCE MACHINE LEARNING AND DATA SCIENCE

As increasingly large and complex datasets are acquired in Earth and 
Planetary Science, autonomy and machine intelligence will have a 
critical role in interpreting data from planetary missions. There is 
a need for frameworks that can rapidly and intelligently extract 
information from these datasets in a useful manner for scientific 
analysis. Such innovations will largely be driven by machine learning 
(ML) and data science methods. The Machine Learning and Data Science 
Methods for Planetary Science (P020) in the AGU Fall Meeting 2021 
will explore research leveraging ML and data science to enhance our 
scientific understanding and return from planetary data and missions.

We welcome submissions by scientists and engineers that address 
problems in planetary remote sensing and spacecraft observations, 
spacecraft operations and mission planning, surface, atmosphere, and 
space environment characterization, object detection and 
classification, change detection, interpretable methods and other 
studies that apply ML and data science methods to planetary science.

The deadline for all submissions is Wednesday, August 4, 2021 at 
23:59 EDT. Abstracts will not be accepted for review after this date.

GSA SESSION T113. FRIENDS OF HOTH: SMALL, ICY AND OCEAN WORLDS

This year's annual Geological Society of America meeting features 
numerous sessions devoted to planetary sciences. We would like to 
highlight the session titled "Friends of Hoth: Episode V - Small, Icy 
and Ocean Worlds (T113)."

We seek abstracts relating to surface, structural, and tectonic 
processes; interior and thermal evolution; and planetary analogs as 
they pertain to solid bodies in the outer Solar System. This includes 
experimental, observational, and theoretical approaches.

The deadline for abstract submission is July 20th, 2021. GSA is 
scheduled for October 10-13, 2021 in Portland, Oregon.
