IN MEMORIAM: CAROLYN SHOEMAKER (1929-2021)
   
American astronomer and co-discoverer of Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9, 
Carolyn Shoemaker, passed away on August 13, 2021, at the age of 92. 
She discovered 32 comets and more than 500 asteroids. After raising a
family with husband Eugene Showmaker, she started her remarkable
astronomical career at the age of 51. She was a research professor at
Nothern Arizona University, and the recipient of the NASA Exceptional 
Scientific Achievement Medal, the National Academies of Science Watson
Medal, and the Rittenhouse Medal. Minor Planet 4445 Carolyn is named
in her honor. Some memorials have been published at:

IDEA FELLOW POSTDOV AT STONY BROOK UNIVERSITY

The Stony Brook University Department of Geosciences will soon be 
taking applications as part of the College of Arts and Sciences IDEA 
Fellows program. The selected IDEA Fellow will be a postdoctoral 
researcher committed to inclusion, diversity, equity, and 
accessibility. The Fellow will have full access to the world-class 
research labs in our department and will be expected to develop 
research collaborations with our faculty. We have active research 
groups in planetary science, mineral physics, 
geochemistry/geochronology, and seismology/geophysics. Opportunities 
also exist to collaborate with staff at the National Synchrotron Light 
Source II at Brookhaven National Laboratory, 30 minutes from Stony 
Brook.

After two years, the IDEA Fellow position will convert to a tenure 
track position, including a startup package. For department 
information, go to: 

https://www.stonybrook.edu/geosciences/index.html 

For information about the IDEA Fellows program, including application 
instructions, go to:

HEAD OF PLANETARY GEOLOGY DEPARTMENT AT DLR'S INSTITUTE OF PLANETARY 
RESEARCH

The Department of Planetary Geology at the Institute of Planetary 
Research, part of the German Aerospace Center (DLR), seeks a new head. 
Some of our research areas include planetary surface processes, 
astrobiology, habitability of solid surface bodies, and fieldwork on 
terrestrial analogues. We are involved in the development of 
instruments and participate in many present and future space missions, 
including Mars Express, ExoMars, and JUICE. The head of the department 
will be responsible for ~20 employees.

Successful candidates are expected to have:

- profound knowledge in one or more of the research areas above
- an excellent publication record
- an interest in multidisciplinary research
- long-term experience in the scientific-and technical management of 
  international large-scale planetary research projects in cooperation 
  with EU, ESA, NASA, JAXA or others
- proven experience regarding the acquisition and execution of 
  third-party funded projects
- work experience abroad
- excellent written and spoken English skills

All candidates must have earned a Ph.D. degree in geology, mineralogy, 
spectroscopy, geophysics, or a related field by the time of the 
appointment.

INTERNATIONAL MARS ICE MAPPER (I-MIM) REMINDER of APPLICATION DEADLINE

NASA and the Canadian, Italian, and Japanese space agencies are 
looking for applicants for membership on the Joint ASI/CSA/JAXA/NASA 
Measurement Definition Team (MDT) for the International Mars Ice Mapper 
Mission (I-MIM). I-MIM would map and characterize accessible (within 
the uppermost 10m) subsurface water ice and its overburden in 
mid-to-low latitudes to support planning for potential human surface 
missions to Mars. This (unfunded) opportunity is open to scientists, 
engineers, and other qualified and interested individuals from 
institutions worldwide. For reasons of cost, time, and safety, most of 
the MDT's work will be carried out using email and tele/video 
conferences.   

The full text of this call and all associated documentation and 
application materials can be found at:   

https://go.nasa.gov/imim_mdt    

Applications are due August 23, 2021.

OPPORTUNITIES FOR AGU FALL MEETING CAREGIVER AWARDS

In an effort to make attendance at the 2021 Fall AGU meeting as widely 
accessible as possible, and to gauge the need of its members, the 
Planetary Sciences section wants to offer awards for caregivers (child 
or dependent) to support their Fall Meeting attendance. These monetary 
awards do not require in-person attendance. At this time, we cannot 
gauge the level of reimbursement we will be able to provide, or 
guarantee that all need will be met, but we will strive to support as 
many people as possible.  

Applications are kindly requested by October 15th and are available at:

https://bit.ly/3mmB8nZ

We plan to notify recipients before the end of Early Bird registration:

FIVE POST-DOC POSITIONS IN THE SPACE AND PLANETARY SCIENCE CENTER AT 
KHALIFA UNIVERSITY, ABU DHABI, UAE

The selected candidates would be associated with the newly formed Space 
and Planetary Science Center (SPSC) at Khalifa University. The center 
was formed in July 2021, and focuses on the analysis of data from 
current space missions, as well as the development of future ones. The 
center is involved in a number of space missions and instruments 
including HiRISE on board NASA's Mars Reconnoissance Orbiter, CaSSIS on 
board ESA's ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter, and NASA's New Horizons mission, 
as well as involvement in future missions including the Emirates Lunar 
mission, ESA's ExoMars rover, and ESA's Comet Interceptor mission.

The center invites applications for 5 post-doc positions in the 
following disciplines:

- Mars research (two positions)
- Lunar research
- Small bodies
- Modeling of planetary processes 

All candidates must have earned a Ph.D. degree in Earth Sciences, 
Planetary Sciences, Physics or a related field by the time of the 
appointment. 

Khalifa University offers an attractive compensation and benefits 
package, commensurate with the successful candidate's background and 
experience.
