[NASA] SCIENTIFIC INFORMATION POLICY FOR THE SCIENCE MISSION 
DIRECTORATE

The data, software, and publications produced as part of NASA's 
scientific research activities, regardless of funding vehicle, e.g. 
grant, contract, inter-or intra-agency agreements, represents a 
significant public investment. NASA holds this information as a public 
trust to increase knowledge and serve the public good. It is Science 
Mission Directorate's (SMD) policy, consistent with NASA and Federal 
policy, that information produced from SMD-funded scientific research 
activities be made publicly available to the greatest practical extent.

To provide contextual guidance to proposers, awardees and other members 
of our communities, SMD has created SPD-41: The Scientific Information 
Policy. SPD-41 applies to all SMD-funded missions and research. All 
parties involved or hoping to become involved in SMD research are 
encouraged to read this policy document. Go to:

https://science.nasa.gov/researchers/science-data/science-information-policy

SMD plans to release a Request for Information (RFI) by the end of 
October. In addition, we plan to hold a virtual community townhall.

EXMAG MEETING ANNOUNCEMENT

The Extraterestrial Materials Analysis Group (ExMAG) will meet 
virtually on October 14-15, 2021 from 11 AM-5 PM EDT. There is no 
registration fee but registration is required by October 11, 2021. The 
fall meeting will focus on sample return missions and technologies, 
sample collections, facilities and informatics, and advanced analysis 
and curation methods. We invite early-career members of the sample 
analysis community (students, postdocs, and those within 10 years of 
their terminal degree) to have coffee with the ExMAG Chair on 
October 14 from 10-11 AM EDT, an informal hour to learn about ExMAG and 
talk about issues important to you. A virtual poster session to view 
facilities posters will be held in Gather.town on October 15 from 
10-11 AM EDT. The list of posters will be posted on the agenda page.

[NASA] PLANETARY DATA ECOSYSTEM CHIEF SCIENTIST SOUGHT

Location: Mostly virtual

NASA's Planetary Science Division is seeking a highly experienced 
planetary science expert to serve as its Chief Scientist to represent 
the Planetary Data Ecosystem (PDE). The Planetary Data Ecosystem 
defines the broad community of planetary scientists, engineers, mission 
specialists, data providers, data users and planetary science educators 
who have interests in planetary missions and their data. The selected 
Chief Scientist will have a strong background in planetary science and 
serve as the liaison between the PDE and NASA's Planetary Data System 
(PDS). The Chief Scientist will report to the PDS Program Scientist at 
NASA HQ.  

The solicitation is open to the public. This virtual position will be 
served mostly remotely, will be part time and funded at approximately 
0.2 FTE, depending on the details of funding arrangements. The position 
will be a temporary assignment, not to exceed three years, ending (at 
the latest) in Fall 2024.

Candidates wishing to apply for this position should send their 
nomination package to Dr. Timothy P. McClanahan at 
timothy.p.mcclanahan@nasa.gov. The due date for applications is

PAN POSTDOCTORAL RESEARCH FELLOWSHIP POSITION AT RICE UNIVERSITY

The Department of Earth, Environmental and Planetary Sciences at Rice 
University invites applications for the Pan Postdoctoral Research 
Fellowship. We seek candidates with independent research interests that 
intersect with one or more faculty within our department and who 
contribute positively to the diversity of the department through 
outreach or other means. Domestic and international applicants are 
welcome. A Ph.D. is required at the time of appointment, but candidates 
must have received their Ph.D. no more than 3 years before their start 
date at Rice.

Applicants are requested to develop a proposal of research to be 
undertaken during the two year fellowship period. Principal selection 
criteria are scientific excellence, a clearly expressed research plan 
to address questions at the forefront of their field of study, research 
synergies with at least one faculty, and a commitment to fostering 
diversity in their field of research. Proposed research should 
encompass independent research ideas and explore new directions beyond 
the applicant's PhD. Preference will be given to applicants whose 
proposals demonstrate independence and originality, and the potential 
for collaboration with faculty in the Department of Earth, 
Environmental and Planetary Sciences.

[NASA] NEW VENUS PORTAL RELEASED

Having almost the same size and mass as the Earth, and occupying the 
next orbit closer to the Sun from us, Venus was once thought to be 
Earth's sister planet. But radar images piercing its dense blanket of 
acidic clouds reveal a scorched landscape pressure cooked at 464 
degrees C (867 degrees F) and 92 times Earth's atmospheric pressure. 
This year, NASA announced its selection of the upcoming DAVINCI+ and 
VERITAS Discovery missions to Venus, adding to the legacy of data 
gathered by NASA's previous Magellan mission to Venus. Inspired by 
this announcement, NASA's Solar System Treks Project has developed 
and released the new online, browser-based Venus Trek portal: 

https://trek.nasa.gov/venus

The initial release of the portal features a variety of data from the 
Magellan mission's Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) including SAR global 
mosaics, Fresnel reflectivity, microwave emissivity, slope maps, 
hillshade topography, and a digital elevation model. The portal will 
promote understanding of the surface features of Venus and provide an 
important and timely enhancement to the Solar System Treks suite's 
capabilities for comparative planetology. Explore Venus, as well as 
many other amazing worlds in our Solar System, with NASA's Solar System 
Treks at:

[NASA] ROSES-21: ENVISION VENSAR SCIENCE TEAM

Program element C.26 EnVision VenSAR Science Team (VenSAR ST) calls for 
proposals for team members and a team leader for the VenSAR Science 
Team (VeST) over the period of 2021-2026. NASA intends to select ~12 
members for the VeST with a range of expertise relevant to VenSAR, 
Venus science, and multidisciplinary approaches that integrate VenSAR 
with the other instruments planned for EnVision. Of these ~12 members, 
~10 are expected to be from U.S. institutions that will be supported by 
NASA, and up to 2 members are expected to be from institutions located 
in ESA member states with support from their own national or other 
program.

ROSES-2021 Amendment 39 releases final text and due dates for this 
call. Notices of intent to propose are requested by November 19, 2021, 
and 5-page proposals are due January 20, 2022. Go to:
