IN MEMORIAM: STUART ROSS TAYLOR (1925-2021)

Stuart Ross Taylor, one of the founding fathers of planetary science,
passed away on May 23, 2021, in Canberra, Australia.

Taylor was involved in the study of lunar samples from the first sample
return in July 1969. He was a member of the Preliminary Examination
Team at NASA's Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas, and carried out
the first analysis of the first lunar sample returned to Earth.

Taylor lectured at the Universities of Oxford and Cape Town before
moving to the Research School of Earth Sciences at the Australian
National University, where he was an emeritus professor.

Taylor's research included the composition and evolution of the Moon,
the continental crust, tektites and impact glasses, island arc rocks,
and many other topics involving trace element geochemistry. He
published 240 papers in scientific journals and nine books.

Taylor was awarded the Goldschmidt Medal of the Geochemical Society,
the Leonard Medal of the Meteoritical Society, the Bucher Medal and the
Bowen Award of the American Geophysical Union, the Gilbert Award of the
Geological Society of America, and the Shoemaker Distinguished Lunar
Scientist Award. Asteroid 5670 is named Rosstaylor.

[NASA] PDS: MRO CRISM MTRDR AND TER RELEASE 17

PDS announces Release 17 of Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter CRISM Targeted 
Empirical Data Record (TER) and Map-projected Targeted Reduced Data 
Record (MTRDR) products, at:

https://pds-geosciences.wustl.edu/missions/mro/crism.htm

This release fills in data from August 9, 2008, through April 26, 
2009. TER products are image cubes derived from CRISM hyperspectral 
targeted observations, post-processed to standardize the illumination 
and observation geometry and remove atmospheric gas absorptions and 
instrument artifacts. MTRDRs are the same products map-projected using 
terrain models of the Martian surface.

and environmental effects of the Moon on physical systems:

-Lunar dust and its properties, behavior, and mitigation
-Life support and thermal management
-Materials flammability and habitat fire safety
-Extraction of water-ice from regolith research, including separation, 
purification, electrolysis, and liquefaction
-Lunar environment and its effects on materials
-Lunar research in extraction, processing, and handling

SURVEY ON VLT/SPHERE DATA

We have implemented a survey to get feedback from any researcher who 
might be interested in VLT/SPHERE data and other high contrast imaging 
survey data, so that we can improve our services and implement new 
functionalities based on your real needs.

This survey is aimed both at researchers who already know these 
services and at researchers who do not know them yet.

The main mission of the SPHERE Data Center is to process all SPHERE 
public data and make available the reduced products. We also perform 
data processing on request. The reduction and analysis is based on the 
official ESO pipeline, as well as many dedicated improvements and 
additional routines (reduction, frame sorting, analysis, 
characterisation). In addition to reduced SPHERE data, through the 
DIVA+ database, we also distribute reduced high contrast imaging data 
from several published exoplanet surveys (acquired VLT/Naco, HST, 
Keck, etc.).

If you are interested by this kind of data, please fill the survey 
before June 17 of June:

https://spheredc.limesurvey.net/497529?lang=en

It should take between 5-15 minutes and will be of considerable help 
for us to improve our service to the astronomical community.

A RESOURCE GUIDE FOR DEALING WITH UFO STORIES

There has been a recent increase in stories regarding UFO's as 
mysteries related to extra-terrestrials. Working with the UFO 
subcommittee of the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry (and such 
astronomers as David Morrison and Seth Shostak), Andrew Fraknoi has 
assembled a one-page guide for colleagues who are getting questions on 
this topic. This resource can familiarize scientists, educators, 
students, and journalists with more of the backstory and what proper 
analyses can show.

The page is available free at:
