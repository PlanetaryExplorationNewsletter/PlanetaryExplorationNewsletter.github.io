[NASA] PDS: HAYABUSA2 TIR RELEASE

This release of Hayabusa2 data includes the TIR raw and calibrated data
bundle and the updated Hayabusa2 Mission bundle with updated
dictionaries and documents. The included data cover the full Ryugu 
encounter.

These data are now available at:

https://pds.nasa.gov/datasearch/subscription-service/SS-20211014.shtml

Or more directly at the PDS Hayabusa2 mission archive page at

https://sbn.psi.edu/pds/resource/hayabusa2/

The Hayabusa2 data are in the process of being prepared for PDS
archiving. We expect most raw and calibrated orbiter data and MASCAM
data to be released over the course of 2021. Other surface
observations, radio science, and derived data are expected in 2022.

FREE SHARING PLANETARY SCIENCE SEMINAR ON ENGAGING CHILDREN

All planetary scientists and engineers, including early career
scientists and graduate students, are invited to join us on October 19
at 3:00 p.m. CDT for this free seminar. Many scientists are less
experienced in interacting with young audiences. Join Sha'Rell Webb
(LPI Public Engagement Lead), Vivian White (Astronomical Society of the
Pacific's Director of Free Choice Learning) and Christine Shupla (LPI
Education and Public Engagement Manager) to practice strategies for
engaging children in planetary science.

CALL FOR PAPERS: PLANETARY LANDSCAPES, LANDFORMS, AND THEIR ANALOGUES,
ESURF SPECIAL ISSUE

We are pleased to announce a Call for Papers for a Special Issue of
Earth Surface Dynamics (ESurf), entitled "Planetary landscapes,
landforms, and their analogues".

This special issue spans Planetary Geomorphology across the Solar
System, with a particular focus on comparative planetology and
terrestrial analogue studies. The focus of individual papers in the
special issue is flexible. More information can be found under 2021
Scheduled SIs at the following link:

https://www.earth-surface-dynamics.net/articles_and_preprints/scheduled_sis.html 

Interested in submitting a manuscript? If you are considering
submitting a manuscript, or have any questions, please do get in touch
with us (f.butcher@sheffield.ac.uk and susan.conway@univ-nantes.fr).

Manuscript Submission: Authors can submit their contribution using the
registration form on the ESurf website: 

https://editor.copernicus.org/ESurf/manuscript_registration

It is important that the correct special issue is selected during the
registration process.

Deadline: The deadline for submissions is 30 November 2022.
Individual papers will be made available online with DOI after
acceptance. There is a 50% publication fee reduction for the first 6
papers to be submitted.

Many thanks

Frances Butcher and Susan Conway (Special Issue Guest Editors)

NEW VENUS PORTAL RELEASED

Having almost the same size and mass as the Earth, and occupying the
next orbit closer to the Sun from us, Venus was once thought to be
Earth's sister planet. But radar images piercing its dense blanket of
acidic clouds reveal a scorched landscape pressure cooked at 464
degrees C (867 degrees F) and 92 times Earth's atmospheric pressure.
This year, NASA announced its selection of the upcoming DAVINCI+ and
VERITAS Discovery missions to Venus, adding to the legacy of data
gathered by NASA's previous Magellan mission to Venus. Inspired by this
announcement, NASA's Solar System Treks Project has developed and 
released the new online, browser-based Venus Trek portal:

https://trek.nasa.gov/venus

The initial release of the portal features a variety of data from the
Magellan mission's Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) including SAR global
mosaics, Fresnel reflectivity, microwave emissivity, slope maps,
hillshade topography, and a digital elevation model. The portal will
promote understanding of the surface features of Venus and provide an
important and timely enhancement to the Solar System Treks suite's
capabilities for comparative planetology. Explore Venus, as well as
many other amazing worlds in our Solar System, with NASA's Solar System
Treks at:

DART BOARDER PROGRAM INDICATION OF INTEREST FOR JANUARY INVESTIGATION
TEAM MEETING

https://forms.gle/485qLEcgPyoaPag56

The Double Asteroid Redirection Test (DART) Investigation Team is
reopening the "DART Boarders" program to introduce advanced graduate 
students and early career scientists (< 7 years since terminal degree) 
to the experience of working on a mission team via an invitation to 
observe the DART Investigation Team meeting 18-21 January, 2022.

Unfortunately, we cannot offer support for time spent in the program,
but we anticipate a commitment of roughly 20-24 hours spread over the
week prior to and week of the team meeting. 

Respondents will be selected based upon anticipated impact to their
career path and alignment of their research interests with the mission
objectives, giving preference to candidates without existing
connections to the team via current advisor-student relationships. DART
recognizes and supports the benefits of having diverse and inclusive
communities and expects such values to be reflected in this
opportunity.

Questions can be sent to andy.rivkin@jhuapl.edu with subject line "DART
Boarders". The indication of interest must be filled out by 16 November, 
2021. Applicants will be notified of the outcome by mid-December.

JOB OPPRORTUNITY PLANETARY ASTRONOMER

The SETI Institute is seeking a Planetary Astronomer to support the
work of the Ring-Moon Systems Node (RMS) of NASA's Planetary Data
System (PDS).

The astronomer will focus primarily on expanding the coverage of OPUS,
the flagship service of the RMS Node, which provides powerful and
effective cross-mission, cross-target, faceted search based on accurate
and consistent metadata and informative browse products. The astronomer
will develop software pipelines that integrate additional data sets
into OPUS, including those from Galileo, New Horizons, Juno, and the
Hubble Space Telescope. 

The astronomer will also develop data processing pipelines to convert
data sets currently archived with PDS into the more modern "PDS4"
standard.

This challenging and rewarding role, which provides an important
service to the planetary research community, requires both experience
working with planetary data and skill at programming in Python, as well
as familiarity with the SPICE toolkit.

MULTIPLE FACULTY POSITIONS IN "ORIGINS OF LIFE" IN PURDUE UNIVERSITY'S
COLLEGE OF SCIENCE

The Departments of Biological Sciences, Chemistry, and Earth,
Atmospheric, and Planetary Sciences at Purdue University invite
applicants for up to three faculty positions at the rank of Assistant
or Associate Professor, rank to be commensurate with experience, and
departmental appointments to align with candidates' expertise and
interests. Applications are welcomed from researchers in all areas with
relevance to the Origins of Life, including but not limited to
evolutionary biology, phylogenetics, computational biology, molecular
biology, microbiology, synthetic biology, prebiotic chemistry,
biocatalysis, astrochemistry, self replicating and evolutionary
systems, astrobiology, biogeochemistry, physical processes related to
abiogenesis, and planetary habitability. Experimental, computational,
observational, and theoretical scientists are encouraged to apply.
Applicants that work across multiple disciplines or work to develop
interdisciplinary collaborations are especially encouraged to apply.

Broadly speaking, the Origins of Life search will consider fields of
research and processes related to how life first evolved on earth, how
life continues to evolve, and whether and where life exists elsewhere
in the universe and how it informs the origins of life on earth.

Applications will be reviewed beginning November 1, 2021 and will
continue until the position is filled.
