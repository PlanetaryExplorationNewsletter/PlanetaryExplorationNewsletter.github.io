COMETS POSTDOC POSITION AT THE UNIVERSITY OF EDINBURGH

We are hiring a Postdoctoral Research Associate in the field of 
cometary science. The successful candidate will join the research group 
led by Dr. Colin Snodgrass and Dr. Cyrielle Opitom at the University of 
Edinburgh.

The research goal of this position is to advance our understanding of 
the formation, evolution, and composition of comets. The successful 
candidate will work on a variety of projects in this area, depending on 
their experience and research interests. Potential areas of interest 
include (but are not restricted to):

- The study of comet composition at infrared wavelengths
- Cometary science with the Rubin Observatory LSST
- The analysis of archival data from the ESA Rosetta mission
- Theoretical modelling of any aspect of comet formation or activity 
  processes
- Studies relevant to the development of the ESA Comet Interceptor 
  mission

This position is initially for a fixed term of two years, but may be 
extended, subject to available funding.

We welcome applications from all qualified candidates, regardless of 
nationality.

Please include your CV, a research proposal (2 pages) and the names 
of two referees.

For more information contact Cyrielle.Opitom@ed.ac.uk and/or 
Colin.Snodgrass@ed.ac.uk and go to:

NEOWISE 2021 DATA RELEASE

The Near-Earth Object Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (NEOWISE) and 
IPAC at Caltech announce the NEOWISE 2021 Data Release.

The 2021 Release includes all data acquired during the seventh year of 
the NEOWISE Reactivation mission (Mainzer et al. 2014, ApJ, 792, 30), 
December 13, 2019, to December 13, 2020. These data are combined with 
those from Years 1-6 NEOWISE into a single archive that contains 
approximately 17.8 million sets of 3.4 and 4.6 micron images and a 
database of ~133 billion source detections. 

NEOWISE scanned the sky ~fourteen complete times during the first seven 
survey years, with approximately six months between survey passes. 
With twelve or more independent 3.4 and 4.6 micron exposures made on 
each sky position during each epoch, the NEOWISE archive is a 
time-domain resource for extracting multiple, independent thermal flux 
and position measurements of Solar System small bodies, as well as 
background galactic and extragalactic sources.

A guide to the NEOWISE data release, data access instructions and 
supporting documentation is available at: 

http://wise2.ipac.caltech.edu/docs/release/neowise/

NEOWISE is a joint project of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory/
California Institute of Technology and the University of Arizona, 
funded by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Planetary 
Science Division.

NOMINATIONS NOW OPEN FOR MEMBERSHIP ON THE PLANETARY SCIENCE ADVISORY 
COMMITTEE

The Planetary Science Advisory Committee (PAC) supports the advisory 
needs of the Planetary Science Division (PSD), the Science Mission 
Directorate (SMD), and other mission directorates as required, as well 
as the NASA Administrator. The advisory scope of the PAC includes all 
aspects of NASA's planetary science program, including scientific 
research; considerations of the development of near-term enabling 
technologies, systems, and computing and information management 
capabilities; and developments with the potential to provide long-term 
improvements in future mission operational systems.

Responsibility for biological planetary protection is outside the 
purview of the PAC. NASA's PSD is extending an invitation for 
nominations for service on the PAC. Interested members of the community 
are invited to review the charter and to submit nominations (including 
self-nominations) for consideration to fill vacancies on the Committee.

ACCEPTING APPLICATIONS FOR ICARUS EDITOR-IN-CHIEF POSITION

The DPS Committee is accepting applications for the position of Icarus 
Editor-in-Chief (EiC). We will use these applications to make a 
recommendation to representatives of Elsevier. The application, 
consisting of a cover letter with a 5-year vision statement and a list 
of skills brought to the position, and a Curriculum Vita and 
publications list, should be submitted to the Chair of the DPS 
Publications Subcommittee, Dr. Catherine Neish (cneish@uwo.ca). Review 
of the applications will begin on April 1, 2021; the anticipated start 
date is May 1, 2021.

The EiC of Icarus is responsible for overseeing the peer review process 
alongside a team of Editors. The role includes working with the 
Publisher and the DPS to shape the direction of the journal as well as 
commissioning review articles and special issues. We are looking for a 
person who is committed to publication excellence and who has broad 
knowledge of planetary science. Ideally, the candidate will have a 
track record of contributing to Icarus either as an author, reviewer, 
guest Editor, Editor, or Advisory Board Member and should have a strong 
publication record. Elsevier will pay the Editor-in-Chief an honorarium 
and expenses to cover journal-related travel.

SPRING 2021 SOFFEN STUDENT TRAVEL GRANT

The Gerald A. Soffen Memorial Fund is pleased to announce the Spring 
2021 Travel Grant application opportunity for undergraduate and 
graduate students pursuing studies in fields of space science and 
engineering. 

The Travel Grants enable student recipients to attend professional 
conferences to present their research. Recipients may use the Grant 
for either virtual or in-person conferences. The Soffen Fund will 
award up to $1000 in total, with no individual award greater than $500,
to cover expenses related to presenting research at either a virtual 
or in-person conference. The number of awards will depend on 
applicants' needs.

The Spring 2021 Travel Grant application deadline is April 5, 2021.
