[NASA] ROSES: NEW DUE DATE FOR TERRESTRIAL ECOLOGY PROGRAM

The due date for proposals to the Terrestrial Ecology program element
described in Appendix A.4 of ROSES-2007 has been changed. The due
date for submitting a proposal is changed from August 15, 2007, to
September 20, 2007.

Solicitations" then "NNH07ZDA001N", then select the appropriate 
program document.]

AAPG 2008 CALL FOR PAPERS: ASTROGEOLOGY-A FAR-SIGHTED LOOK AT 
UNCONVENTIONAL RESOURCES

In keeping with the theme of the 2008 convention, Deliver the 
Conventional; Pursue the Unconventional, the technical session 
"Astrogeology-A Far-Sighted Look at Unconventional Resources" is 
planned for the American Association of Petroleum Geologists 2008 
Annual Convention and Exposition held at the Henry B. Gonzalez 
Convention Center during Fiesta Week (April 20-23, 2008) in San 
Antonio, Texas (http://www.aapg.org/sanantonio/).

Our lives depend in part upon our ability to locate and extract 
natural resources.  To travel beyond Earth's orbit to Mars and 
destinations beyond, we must locate and harvest more distant 
resources. This requires that we adapt current or develop new 
technologies for locating, evaluating, and efficiently recovering 
in situ resources.   

This technical session will address processes or features that may 
influence or indicate the presence and distribution of potential 
resources at or below planetary surfaces, technologies for detecting 
and evaluating surface and subsurface resources, and technologies for 
efficient and economic recovery and utilization of in situ resources. 
Session co-chairs Darrell Sims and Cynthia Dinwiddie welcome 
submissions from the planetary community and particularly encourage 
submissions from industry and Earth scientists regarding practical 
methods for eliciting information about the potential presence of 
planetary resources and technologies for in situ resource 
utilization.

AAPG 2008 CALL FOR PAPERS: RETURN TO THE MOON: RESEARCH, REWARDS, AND
RESEARCH

In the advent of NASA's planned return to the Moon in the next decade 
and possible private sector resource-related activity there, a variety 
of important technical issues will need to be addressed to ensure a 
stable lunar settlement, exploration and development of lunar 
resources, efficient and economic extraction of resources, and an 
improved understanding of Lunar surface and subsurface materials and 
processes. The technical session "Return to the Moon: Research, 
Rewards, and Research," co-chaired by Harrison H. Schmitt and 
William A. Ambrose will address many of these issues. The scope of 
the session will encompass lunar resource economics and exploration, 
surficial and subsurface materials and processes, resources such as 
Helium-3, consumables and propellants, resource extraction 
technology, and future missions to the Moon.

The period for AAPG 2008 abstract submission is August 27 to September 
27, 2007.  To learn more about AAPG 2008 in San Antonio, visit
