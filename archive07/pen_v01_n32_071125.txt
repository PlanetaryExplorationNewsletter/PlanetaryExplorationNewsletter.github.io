[NASA] NEW PROPOSAL OPPORTUNITY FOR ASTROBIOLOGY SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
INSTRUMENT DEVELOPMENT, INCLUDING CONCEPT STUDIES FOR SMALL PAYLOADS 
AND SATELLITES (ASTID)

Notices of Intent to propose are due December 14, 2007, and proposals 
are due February 15, 2008.

[NASA] DEFERRAL OF PROPOSALS FOR NEW HORIZONS AT JUPITER DATA ANALYSIS

The New Horizons at Jupiter Data Analysis program (NH-JDAP) will not 
be competed in 2007. A broader Jupiter Data Analysis Program (JDAP) 
will be competed in ROSES 2008 (to be released mid-February 2008).

NH-JDAP will be broadened to include the analysis of older data on 
the Jupiter system, not just data from the New Horizons mission. This 
is appropriate in that the Galileo mission data returned after 
calendar year 2000 was never open to a Data Analysis Program. 
Furthermore the planetary community has been greatly stimulated by 
the Cassini mission and the new Flagship studies on the Jupiter 
system, and this provides a perfect opportunity to support further 
mission studies in this area.  Voyager data will also be eligible.

[NASA] SUSPENSION OF SUPPLEMENTAL E/PO PROPOSAL OPPORTUNITIES

The opportunity for selected ROSES investigators to submit proposals 
for supplemental E/PO awards is suspended as of December 31, 2007, 
pending a global review of the SMD E/PO portfolio, as the Science 
Mission Directorate moves towards the goal of reducing the proposal 
writing burden on scientists while increasing their science 
productivity and efficiency.  In the interim, no further proposals 
are solicited. However, limited selections will be made from those 
supplemental E/PO proposals submitted by December 31, 2007.

[NASA] EDUCATION AND PUBLIC OUTREACH DIVISION SUPPORT GROUPS 
COOPERATIVE AGREEMENT NOTICE POSTPONED

NASA Cooperate Agreement Notice NNH07ZDA002C entitled "Education and 
Public Outreach Division Support Groups" is postponed until further 
notice. No proposals are solicited at this time.

SMD will convene an EPO working group to assess the need for EPO 
support activities with respect to the other EPO efforts and 
directions the community and NASA believe are most needed at this 
time. SMD cannot make this decision until it decides how much effort 
to put into the various EPO areas: informal vs formal, elementary and 
secondary education vs college and beyond, etc. This decision-making 
will include community input.

[NASA] PDS RELEASES NEW MARS SOIL ANALOG LABORATORY DATA SET 

The Planetary Data System announces the release of a new laboratory
data set, the Mars Analog Soil Observations from the Bloomsburg
University Goniometer (BUG) Laboratory. These are bidirectional
reflectance distribution function measurements of five Mars soil
analogs, acquired using the MER Pancam flight spare filters. The data
set was provided by Michael Shepard, Bloomsburg University, Bloomsburg,
Pennsylvania.

It is available from the PDS Geosciences Node web site:

TOUCHDOWN ON TITAN WEBCAST LECTURE

The Royal Society is organising a free lecture on Monday 3 December at
6.30pm GMT (1:30pm EDT) that you and your colleagues may be interested
in.

Professor John Zarnecki of the Centre for Earth, Planetary, Space and
Astronomical Research (CEPSAR) will be delivering the public lecture
entitled "Touchdown on Titan". 

Further details can be found at:

http://www.royalsoc.ac.uk/event.asp?id=7170. 

The lecture will be webcast live from our website at:

http://www.royalsoc.ac.uk

and then made available as a view-on-demand video from the video
archive at:
