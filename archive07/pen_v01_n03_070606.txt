NASA ANNOUNCEMENT 

ROSES-07 AMENDMENT 8: FINAL TEXT FOR LUNAR ADVANCED SCIENCE AND
EXPLORATION RESEARCH

This amendment replaces the draft text in Appendix C.24 entitled 
"Lunar Advanced Science and Exploration Research" (LASER) with the 
final text.  The LASER program supports and enhances lunar basic 
science and lunar exploration science as part of the Vision for Space 
Exploration's return to the Moon. It is the objective of the LASER 
program to conduct a portfolio of lunar science investigations 
spanning the continuum from basic science to applied exploration 
science. The LASER program also welcomes the submission of "data 
restoration" proposals. The LASER program is jointly supported by 
NASA's Science Mission Directorate (SMD) and Exploration Systems 
Mission Directorate (ESMD). Notices of Intent to propose are due June 
29, 2007, and proposals are due September 7, 2007.

On or about May 31, 2007, this Amendment to the NASA Research 
Announcement "Research Opportunities in Space and Earth Sciences 
(ROSES) 2007" (NNH07ZDA001N) will be posted on the NASA research 
opportunity homepage at http://nspires.nasaprs.com/ (select 
"Solicitations" then "Open Solicitations" then "NNH07ZDA001N").

You may receive this email twice because it has been sent to the 
Science Mission Directorate (SMD) and Exploration Systems Mission 
Directorate (ESMD) distribution lists.

NASA ANNOUNCEMENT

NSPIRES: DRAFT SMALL EXPLORER (SMEX) AO ISSUED FOR COMMENT

The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Science 
Mission Directorate is releasing a DRAFT Announcement of Opportunity 
(AO) for community review and comment for the next missions in the 
Small-class Explorer (SMEX) program.  Selections of proposals through 
the final AO, once released, are intended to provide three mission 
launches by April 2014.  Mission of Opportunity investigations, which 
may be partner missions, new science mission extensions, or small 
complete missions may also be selected.  The science objectives 
covered by this AO address the goals of NASA's heliophysics and 
astrophysics program. Participation in this AO will be open to all 
categories of organizations (U.S. and non-U.S.), including 
educational institutions, industry, not-for-profit organizations, 
Federally Funded Research and Development Centers (FFRDCs), NASA 
Centers, the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), and other Government 
agencies.  NASA welcomes critical review and comment of this DRAFT 
AO, which will be available from June 8, 2007, through June 27, 2007, 
via the World Wide Web site: http://nspires.nasaprs.com/. Send 
comments to 

Dr. Hashima Hasan 
Science Mission Directorate
NASA Headquarter, 
Washington, DC 20546-0001 

E-mail:  smexao@hq.nasa.gov

Comments are preferred in writing and may be sent by E-mail; 
the character string "SMEX DRAFT AO" (without quotes) should be 
included in the subject line of all transmissions.  The identity 
of those submitting comments will be held in confidence. Answers 
to frequently asked questions about this Draft AO will be made 
available on the SMEX Acquisition Additional Information web 
page, available via the World Wide Web site:

REQUEST FOR JOVIAN SYSTEM OBSERVATIONS

The New Horizons (NH) spacecraft is making the first-ever journey down the
magnetotail of Jupiter. The NH plasma energetic particle instruments (PEPSSI
and SWAP) have been measuring interesting spatial structure, particle
composition, and temporal variability during their in situ observations. We
encourage remote observations of the Jovian system that are relevant to the
magnetosphere during the next few weeks, including investigations of
aurorae, the Io Plasma Torus, and Io volcanic activity. Observations between
now and 2007 June 21, when PEPSSI and SWAP will be turned off to prepare for
the hibernation of the NH spacecraft, are particularly important. However,
remote observations somewhat after that time may still be useful for piecing
together a coherent picture of the state of the Jovian magnetosphere during
the NH encounter. Interested observers may contact John Spencer
(spencer@boulder.swri.edu) for further information.

10TH MARS CRATER CONSORTIUM, OCTOBER 18-19, 2007

The 10th Mars Crater Consortium meeting will be held October 18-19, 2007 
at the US Geological Survey in Flagstaff, AZ.  The meeting provides a 
venue for discussion of issues related to impact crater morphology, 
formation, and degradation with particular emphasis on martian impact 
craters.  The meeting includes scientific presentations, updates from 
mission scientists, and time for general discussion.  Abstracts are 
required from those wishing to present and are due by October 12.  An 
optional field trip around the rim of Meteor Crater will be arranged for 
Saturday, October 20 if there is sufficient interest.  For more 
information, see http://www.marscraterconsortium.nau.edu or contact 
Nadine Barlow at Nadine.Barlow@nau.edu.

DIRECTOR, HAWAII INSTITUTE OF GEOPHYSICS AND PLANETOLOGY (HIGP)

HIGP is a research unit within the University of Hawaii School of Ocean 
and Earth Sciences and Technology. HIGP conducts advanced research, 
technology development, workforce training, and service in 
oceanographic, atmospheric, geophysical, geological, and planetary 
sciences. The Institute is home to approximately 100 faculty members, 
staff, postdoctoral researchers, and graduate students featuring 
state-of-the-art laboratories and instrumentation. Our expertise spans 
the Earth from pole to pole, from the deep Earth interior to the upper 
atmosphere, and extends to the Moon, Mars, and beyond.  HIGP seeks a 
dynamic individual who can provide scientific and technical leadership, 
nurture the entrepreneurial spirit of the Institute faculty and staff, 
and guide the Institute through the complexities of the modern research 
environment. The Director is ultimately responsible for ensuring that 
HIGP remains one of the most influential geoscience programs in the 
United States. Minimum qualifications: Earned doctorate in geosciences 
or closely related earth- or planetary-science or engineering 
discipline. Successful experience in academic administration at the 
level of chairperson or higher, or comparable experience in private or 
public research management. Rank of full professor or comparable 
professional experience. A record of strong research, scholarship, 
publication, and professional activities and achievement.
