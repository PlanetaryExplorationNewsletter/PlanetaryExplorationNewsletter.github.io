[NASA] SARA SERVICE PROBLEM

NASA's Science Mission Directorate (SMD) Research and Analysis (R&A) 
website at:

http://science.hq.nasa.gov/research/sara.html

the SARA website, solicits comments through a "contact SARA" link on 
each webpage.  The "contact SARA" link page was not working properly 
during the first week of website operations. All messages sent to  
NASA through the "contact SARA" link prior to September 12, 2007,  
were lost and cannot be recovered. The problem with the "contact SARA"
link page has now been corrected. If you sent messages through  the
"contact SARA" link during this period, please send them again.  We
apologize for the inconvenience.

Additional updates in content have been made to the SARA website
since it was first released, and a new letter from SARA will be
uploaded on September 14, 2007. In order to receive future notices 
concerning SMD's R&A program, please subscribe to the update notice  
list through the "contact SARA" page. This NSPIRES mailing list will
not be used to distribute R&A updates in the future.

[NASA] SMALL EXPLORERS (SMEX) AND MISSIONS OF OPPORTUNITY

Released:  September 28, 2007
Notice of Intent:  November 16, 2007
Proposals Due:  January 15, 2008

The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Science 
Mission Directorate (SMD) is releasing a NASA Announcement of 
Opportunity (NNH07ZDA003O), for the Explorer Program: Small Explorers 
(SMEX) and Missions of Opportunity.  NASA expects to select up to three 
SMEX missions to proceed into Phase B and subsequent mission phases.  
NASA desires to launch the first SMEX mission by late 2011 or 2012; the 
launch-by date for all SMEX missions is April 30, 2014.  One or more 
Missions of Opportunity, including participation in non-SMD space 
missions, small complete missions and new science missions using 
existing spacecraft, may also be selected.  The science objectives 
covered by the AO include those of the SMD heliophysics research 
program and the astrophysics research program.  Refer to the SMD World 
Wide Web homepage at:

http://science.hq.nasa.gov/

for further information about these programs.

[NASA] CANCELLATION OF LIVING WITH A STAR SPACE ENVIRONMENT TESTBEDS 
PROGRAM

This amendment cancels the program element in Appendix B.6 entitled 
"Living With a Star Space Environment Testbeds." The Living With a 
Star (LWS) program has recently announced that NASA will be providing 
contributions to ESA's Solar Orbiter mission.  A Focused Opportunity 
for the Solar Orbiter mission will be a part of the SMEX AO. See: 

http://explorers.larc.nasa.gov/smexacq.html

At this time, the LWS program can not support new SET investigations 
in addition to the Solar Orbiter focused opportunity.  The LWS 
program is proceeding with the SET-1 mission and all previously 
selected SET investigations. However no further SET investigations 
will be solicited at this time.

[Editor Note: For the remainder of this notice, go to
http://nspires.nasaprs.com/ (select "Solicitations" then 
"Open Solicitations" then "NNH07ZDA001N").]

[NASA] PDS ANNOUNCES SECOND MRO DATA RELEASE (SEPTEMBER 10, 2007)

The Planetary Data System announces the second release of data
from the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO) mission. This release
includes data acquired during months 2 and 3 of the Primary 
Science Phase, December 8, 2006 - February 7, 2007.  

Data sets from the following experiments are included in this 
release: CRISM (Compact Reconnaissance Imaging Spectrometer for
Mars), HiRISE (High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment),
Gravity/Radio Science, MCS (Mars Climate Sounder), CTX
(Context Imager), and MARCI (Mars Color Imager).  SPICE
kernels for all instruments are also available.  New data from 
the Accelerometer and SHARAD (Shallow Radar) will also be 
released shortly.

MRO data are archived at the PDS Geosciences, Imaging, Atmospheres,
and NAIF Nodes, and can be accessed from these nodes' web sites and
from the main PDS home page:

DAWN MISSION REQUESTS OBSERVATIONS OF SPACECRAFT

NASA is preparing to launch Dawn between September 26 and October 15 
on an ambitious mission to orbit both 4 Vesta and 1 Ceres, the two 
most massive asteroids.

The Dawn project invites all readers with telescope time during the 
first week or two after launch to try to image the spacecraft.  Other 
spacecraft have been seen at ranges of several million kilometers.

See an example at:

http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/releases/98/ds1palomar.html.

The project believes such views can be quite inspiring to the public.

If Dawn launches at its first opportunity, it should be near 
RA = 6h 20m and dec = 28.5 deg within a day of launch. Launches at 
later times or on subsequent days may shift this a few degrees. 
Up-to-date coordinates will be available in JPL's HORIZONS system.  
Go to:

http://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/horizons.cgi

and change the target body to "Dawn".

UCLA Professor Christopher T. Russell is the PI for this ninth mission
in NASA's Discovery Program.  Instruments were contributed by DLR/MPS
and ASI/INAF and delivered by LANL.  JPL manages the project, and 
Orbital Sciences Corporation built the spacecraft.  More information 
is available at:

http://dawn.jpl.nasa.gov.

Please contact ctrussel@igpp.ucla.edu if you have any questions or if 
you obtain some images of Dawn's early light.

PLANET DEFINITION 2 CONFERENCE AND BOOK BEING ORGANIZED, MAY 8-10, 2008

Last year, the International Astronomical Union issued a definition for
the term 'planet' that remains controversial, as does the process by
which it was adopted. Some planetary scientists embrace the IAU 
definition, while many reject it. Educators are confused about what to
teach.

A conference is being planned to provide the first open forum to
discuss the underpinnings of the IAU perspective and alternative views.
This will be a great opportunity to discuss science as a process and 
what we have learned about planets in over 40 years of solar system 
exploration and a decade of exoplanet discovery. An accompanying book
is planned.

Science Meeting: May 8-9, 2008
Educator Workshop: May 10, 2008
Location: Applied Physics Lab, Johns Hopkins University, Maryland

Program Chair: Mark Sykes, Planetary Science Institute
Local Organizers: Hal Weaver, Louise Proctor, Applied Physics Lab

Likely topics:
The IAU Planet Definition
Historical Views of Planets
Ceres
Predicting Outer Planets
The Sociology and Science of Pluto and Charon
Jovian Planets
Earth - The Ultimate Planet
Other Terrestrial Planets
Life
Extrasolar Planets
A Geophysical Definition for Planet Planetary Nomenclature

Please indicate your interest in attending by emailing sykes@psi.edu.
Input on topics is welcome. A website is under development. Thank you.

IAU SYMPOSIUM 251: ORGANIC MATTER IN SPACE, HONG KONG, CHINA, 
FEBRUARY 18-22, 2008

Recent infrared spectroscopic observations have found evidence of 
complex carbonaceous compounds with aromatic and aliphatic structures 
in circumstellar and interstellar media. Laboratory isotopic analysis 
of meteorites and interplanetary dust collected in the upper 
atmosphere have revealed the presence of pre-solar grains similar to 
those formed in evolved stars. These solar system dust particles also 
contain complex organics, at least some of which show isotopic 
evidence that they have an interstellar heritage. Spectroscopic 
studies of comets and asteroids also show spectral signatures of
organics. The direct link between star dust and the solar system 
therefore suggests that the early solar system was chemically 
enriched by both stellar ejecta and the products of interstellar 
processing.

In this symposium, to be held at the University of Hong Kong, 
Hong Kong, China, we intend to bring together observational 
astronomers, laboratory spectroscopists, and solar system scientists 
to share their expertise in order to come up with new ideas for the 
solution to the many unsolved mysteries associated with the origin, 
evolution, and distribution of organic matter in space.
