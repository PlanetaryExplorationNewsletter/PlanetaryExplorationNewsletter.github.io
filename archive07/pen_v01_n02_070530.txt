NASA ANNOUNCEMENT 

DISCOVERY MISSION PROGRAM: ITS PAST AND ITS FUTURE

James L. Green <James.green@nasa.gov>
Michael H. New <michael.h.new@nasa.gov>

Late in 1991, Congress directed NASA to prepare  "a plan to stimulate 
and develop small planetary or other space science projects, emphasizing 
those that could be accomplished by the academic or research communities."  
NASA's response, in April 1992, was the Discovery Program.

This is the first announcement of "Discovery at 15: Looking Back, 
Moving Forward" to the PEN.  The conference will be held on September 
19-20 in Huntsville, Alabama.   All former Discovery Principal 
Investigators, Project Managers, and Education/Public Outreach Leads 
will be invited to participate in the conference.  The conference 
will also be open to the scientific community and a session of 
contributed posters on mission concepts and new technologies is 
planned.

Please consult the conference website below for more information:

http://discovery.nasa.gov/Discovery15

If you're in the small planetary mission game, this is a conference 
you don't want to miss.

NASA ANNOUNCEMENT

JOB OPENING: DISCOVERY PROGRAM SCIENTIST AT NASA HQ

James L. Green <James.green@nasa.gov>

A Program Scientist position has just opened up in the Planetary 
Science Division of the Science Mission Directorate at NASA Headquarters. 
This position is open to US citizens in the Planetary Science community 
and not just to existing civil servants. With the upcoming selection 
of the new Discovery Mission(s) and Discovery Mission of Opportunity 
a new Discovery Program Scientist will be needed.

The individual chosen for this position must be able to, for example, 
conduct scientific assessments to assure that the mission goals will 
be accomplished during the development and operations phases and 
serves as the main advocate for the mission's scientific analysis 
phase to include funding, operations, science planning and science 
data analysis. A Discovery Program Scientist plays a critical role in 
mission success.

If your looking for an exciting change that will bring you enormous 
experience in how Planetary Science Division programs at NASA 
Headquarters are conceived and executed this is the position for you. 
Its also your chance to come to NASA Headquarters at a very exciting 
time and work with Alan Stern, Jim Green, and the rest of the 
Planetary Division and be a vital part of shaping its future.

This job is open for applications from May 30, 2007 through June 28, 
2007 and has been posted on the USAJobs web site.

For more information on this exciting positions please see the website:

SATELLITES OF THE OUTER SOLAR SYSTEM WORKSHOP: 1ST PEN ANNOUNCEMENT

James L. Green <james.green@nasa.gov>
Curt Niebur_ curt.niebur@nasa.gov
Mary Cloud <cloud@lpi.usra.edu>

The Workshop on Ices, Oceans, and Fire:  Satellites of the Outer 
Solar System will be held August 13-15, 2007, at the Hotel Boulderado, 
2115 Thirteenth Street, Boulder, Colorado.

Exploration of the outer solar system has revealed that these planetary 
satellites are quite varied. Each of these moon has experienced key 
processes to a different extent. The combination of their individual 
physical properties and chemical compositions with the varying magnitudes 
of the processes experienced by them is largely responsible for their 
evolution to their currently diverse states.

The purpose of this workshop is to bring together researchers to share 
their current research in the broader context of common processes and 
unique properties shaping the satellites of the outer solar system. 
Research characterizing the current state of these satellites is 
fundamental to our understanding of their origin and evolution.

The three-day meeting will be comprised of sessions devoted to 
processes common to the satellites rather than organized around 
specific satellites. The meeting will also provide an opportunity to 
convey research results in more detail than is possible at larger 
conferences with wider audiences. Extended time will be provided for 
presentations, questions, and discussion. For more information on 
this exciting workshop please go to workshop website at:

EUROPA: A PROPOSED NEW VOLUME IN THE UNIVERSITY OF ARIZONA PRESS 
SPACE SCIENCE SERIES

The time is right for an edited book on Europa. After a decade of 
interpretation and modeling of the Galileo data, our understanding of 
Europa has reached a high level of maturity. We have the opportunity 
to bring forward within the University of Arizona Press Space Science 
Series a volume on Europa that describes: "What we know.  How do we 
know it.  Where do we go from here."

The purpose of this message, sent on behalf of the Editors and the
currently forming Scientific Organizing Committee (SOC), is to invite
you to volunteer to participate in the EUROPA project.  You may
volunteer to participate in the SOC, propose to write a chapter,
or recommend chapters and topics for the book.

CALL FOR CHAPTER PROPOSALS.  For details, see: http://www.igpp.ucla.edu/europa

To capitalize on our current state of knowledge, and to take advantage
of an immediate available opening in the production schedule for the
Space Science Series, we wish to bring this book together in a very
timely fashion.

Responses must by received by June 1, 2007, with chapter selection by 
June 15, and chapters due no later than October 15, 2007.

CALL FOR PAPERS: 7th IAA CONFERENCE ON LOW-COST PLANETARY MISSIONS (LCPM7)

The International Academy of Astronautics (IAA) announces the first 
call for papers for the 7th IAA International Conference on Low-Cost 
Planetary Missions (LCPM7).  The 7th conference will be held on the 
campus of the California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, 
California, September 12-14, 2007.  The deadline for abstracts is 
June 29, 2007.

This IAA-sponsored series of conferences has become the premier venue 
for the international community to meet on the topic of low-cost 
robotic solar system exploration conducted by missions whose total 
cost fits within the cost caps of the NASA Discovery and Mars Scout 
programs, or less than $0.5B US.

LCPM7 will have seven plenary sessions conducted in series, comprised 
of invited papers, and poster sessions comprised of contributed 
papers. The topic areas for the conference are: (1) overviews of 
national and international programs, (2) recent science discoveries, 
(3) missions in operation, (4) missions in definition or development, 
(5) learning from the past - lessons for the future, a panel 
discussion, (6) science instruments for the future, and (7) advanced 
concepts for future low-cost planetary missions. Details can be found 
at the conference web site: http://lcpm7.jpl.nasa.gov/

METEOROIDS 2007: AN INTERNATIONAL MEETING ON SOLAR SYSTEM MINOR BODIES

BARCELONA (Spain), June 11 - June 15 2007

http://www.spmn.uji.es/meteoroids-2007/

Aims: This conference will be the sixth in a series of meteoroid meetings 
that have been held every few years since 1993, the last being in the 
University of Western Ontario, Canada in 2004. It will accommodate a broad 
range of meteoroid research: orbital dynamics, sources and distribution of 
these bodies, the physics and chemistry of their interaction process with 
the atmosphere as well as their origin and link with minor bodies: asteroids 
and comets. Due to the exciting new results of interplanetary missions to 
study asteroids and comets, special sessions will be devoted to these bodies 
with emphasis on meteoroid origin and chemical composition.

The Final Scientific Program of the Conference is now available at:
