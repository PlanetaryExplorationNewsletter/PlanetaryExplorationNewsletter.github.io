[NASA] ROSES-07: NEW DUE DATES FOR PLANETARY INSTRUMENT DEFINITION AND
DEVELOPMENT (PIDD)

The Planetary Instrument Definition and Development (PIDD) program 
element described in Appendix C.16 of ROSES-2007has been amended to 
allow proposals for up to 4 years.

In order to allow proposers sufficient time to respond to this 
change, the due date for proposals to PIDD has been changed. The due 
date for submitting a proposal is changed from August 3, 2007, to 
September 12, 2007.

On or about July 17, 2007, this Amendment to the NASA Research 
Announcement "Research Opportunities in Space and Earth Sciences 
(ROSES) 2007" (NNH07ZDA001N) will be posted on the NASA research 
opportunity homepage at http://nspires.nasaprs.com/ (select 
"Solicitations" then "Open Solicitations" then "NNH07ZDA001N").

Further information about this program element is available from Dr. 
Jonathan A. R. Rall, Planetary Science Division, Science Mission 
Directorate, NASA, Washington, DC 20546-0001; Telephone: (202)

NAI ICY WORLDS FOCUS GROUP - MEETING QUESTIONAIRE

Dear colleague,

At the request of Carl Pilcher and the NASA Astrobiology Institute, 
we have agreed to organize a meeting "NAI Icy Worlds Focus Group" at 
NASA-Ames Research Center 20-21 September 2007. This meeting is a 
possible fusion of previous "focus groups," such as the Titan and 
Europa FGs.

As in previous focus group meeting, the goals the September meeting 
are to share relevant astrobiology research results and to provide a 
venue for fostering collaborative work. In addition, we plan to hear 
about the four "flagship mission" studies currently underway for 
Europa, Titan, Enceladus, and the Jupiter system.

We recognize that there are various meeting this year regarding the 
outer solar system, but the Icy Worlds Focus Group is to provide a 
means for astrobiology to share ideas.

Please address the following and return to us:

I would like to present (add title):

We look forward to hearing from you!

Titan, the largest moon of Saturn, is one of the most fascinating 
objects in our solar system, hosting an atmosphere similar in many 
aspects to that of Earth. This meeting brings together world experts 
that analyze observations from the Cassini/Huygens mission to reveal 
the mysteries of Titan's thick atmosphere, its rich organic chemistry, 
cloud physics, dynamics, and space environment.
