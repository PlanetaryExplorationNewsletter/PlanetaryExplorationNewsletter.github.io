NEW LUNAR AND PLANETARY INSTITUTE WEBSITE FOR THE LUNAR SCIENCE
AND EXPLORATION COMMUNITY

After a 35-year hiatus, NASA is returning humans to the Moon. To 
support that activity, the Lunar and Planetary Institute (LPI) has
developed a new web-based information portal for the lunar science
and exploration community: 

http://www.lpi.usra.edu/lunar

This new website provides access to everything "lunar" from the 
earliest Apollo-era documents to the most recent lunar research 
reports.

Information is organized under specific categories: (1) Lunar 
Mission Summaries; (2) Apollo-Era Documents; (3) Lunar Samples; 
(4) Lunar Images; (5) Lunar Surface; (6) Lunar Meteorites; 
(7) Exploration Strategies; (8) Constellation Hardware; (9) Landing 
Site Studies; (10) Computational Tools; (11) Educational Products.

Data can also be accessed through a new LPI Lunar Search Engine, 
which provides links to both USRA-LPI documents and information 
at other lunar-information sites.

This is a living web-based system. As the exploration initiative 
grows, the content of this portal will expand appropriately, 
providing a one-stop source of lunar information.

Highlights of the website include a new Lunar Orbiter Photo Gallery, 
with new views of over 2600 Lunar Orbiter images, as well as
lunar-related computational tools, the first of which allows users 
to calculate the sizes of craters produced on the lunar surface as 
a function of impact parameters.

VEXAG NEWS - VEXAG MEETING #4 AND THE VENUS EXPLORATION GOALS,
OBJECTIVES, INVESTIGATIONS, AND PRIORITIES DOCUMENT

The Venus Exploration Analysis Group (VEXAG) will be holding its 4th
meeting on Sunday afternoon and Manday, November 4th and 5yth, 2007
at the Greenbelt Marriot Hotel, Greenbelt, Maryland.  This meeting
will be held in conjunction with NASA's Workshop on Planetary
Atmospheres and the Outer Planet Analysis Group (OPAG) meetings,
which will be at the Greenbelt Marriot Hotel later in that first full
week of November.  A preliminary agenda is posted on the VEXAG
web-site:

http://www.lpi.usra.edu/vexag/

The first version  of VEXAG's The Venus Exploration Goals,
Objectives, Investigations, and Priorities Document is now posted at

http://www.lpi.usra.edu/vexag/reports.html.

This is based on the inputs provided by the scientific community
during VEXAG meetings 1, 2 and 3 and via email to the VEXAG Steering
Group. Given the recent successes of the European Venus Express
orbital mission (which in its first 500 days has thus far returned
over 1 terabit of data encompassing the planet's surface, atmosphere,
and surrounding space environments), this report documents the needs
and requirements for the "Next Steps" in Venus exploration,
emphasizing in particular the need for in-situ analysis of Venus's
atmosphere and surface. A variety of mission architectures -
including balloons, landers, and near-surface aerobotic rovers - are
outlined.

FINAL ANNOUNCEMENT: SECOND LANDING SITE WORKSHOP FOR THE 2009 MARS 
SCIENCE LABORATORY

The program and agenda for the second landing site workshop for the 
2009 Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) is now available online and can be
viewed at:

http://marsoweb.nas.nasa.gov/landingsites/

and

http://webgis.wr.usgs.gov/msl

The workshop will be held at the Courtyard Marriott in Old Town 
Pasadena, CA, on October 23-25, 2007. The format will include oral
presentations and general discussion of the proposed landing sites.
The primary goal of the second workshop will be to evaluate the
sites that emerged from the first workshop as well as any new sites
being proposed.

Revision of the MSL landing site selection schedule requires that 
the list of sites under consideration be narrowed to five at
the end of the second workshop. These sites will then be 
considered in more detail by the MSL Project, Mars Program, and
the Science Community with the expectation that additional orbital 
data will be obtained.  An MSL science and engineering criteria
chart is posted at the above referenced websites and lists the
landing site attributes that will be discussed and used to help
distinguish between sites at the workshop.
