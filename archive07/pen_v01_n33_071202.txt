[NASA] SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY DEFINITION TEAMS FOR VENUS MISSION
ARCHITECTURE

NASA is forming a Science and Technology Definition Team (STDT) for 
Venus that will work directly with engineers and mission formulation 
experts to determine and prioritize science objectives, mission 
architectures, technical challenges, cost estimates, and other mission 
elements for Venus exploration in the context of the Decadal Survey
goals.

The Venus STDT will consist of approximately 12 members; Mark Bullock 
(SWRI) will serve as the chair of the Venus STDT. To indicate interest, 
send an email to Adriana Ocampo (aco@nasa.gov) containing (a) a one 
page description of your areas of expertise and possible contribution 
to the STDT and (b) an abbreviated CV with emphasis on relevant 
experience. STDT members will be required to participate in regular 
teleconferences and conduct occasional travel for meetings including 
a kick off meeting in mid-January 2008. STDT members will be 
reimbursed for travel expenses. The Venus STDT will conclude its work 
by September 30, 2008.

Letters of interest must be received by email no later than December 
15, 2007 (12:00 noon EST) to be considered.

For further information, please contact Dr. Adriana Ocampo, Planetary 
Science Division, Science Mission Directorate, National Aeronautics 
and Space Administration, Washington, DC 20546-0001; Telephone: (202) 
358-2152; E-mail aco@nasa.gov.

[NASA] INVESTIGATIONS ON THE INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION

The NASA Announcement of Opportunity NNH07ZDA003O, "Explorer Program: 
Small Explorers (SMEX) and Missions of Opportunity," now allows Mission 
of Opportunity proposals for NASA-sponsored investigations on the 
International Space Station that can be delivered by the HTV cargo 
vehicle.

Proposers intending to submit proposals for ISS-based Mission of 
Opportunity investigations should submit a Notices of Intent (NOI) 
no later than December 11, 2007

The due date for Mission of Opportunity proposals for NASA-sponsored 
investigations on the International Space Station is February 12, 
2008, which is later than the due date for other SMEX proposals.

SOFIA WORKSHOP AT UPCOMING AAS - DATE CHANGE TO JANUARY 7

The SOFIA Early Science Opportunities workshop at the Jan. 2008 AAS 
meeting in Austin will be held 1 to 5 p.m. on Monday, Jan. 7, before 
the AAS opening reception. That is a change in date from previous 
announcements.

This will be the first in a series of workshops regarding early 
science opportunities with SOFIA, currently scheduled to begin in 
2009. The workshop will include updates on status of SOFIA and its 
9 scientific instruments, plus a charge to working groups to consider 
the general observer science plan and update SOFIA's science cases.

EVERYONE IS WELCOME. We encourage attendance by astronomers who 
have never had airborne astronomy experience, theoreticians, and 
astronomers currently making use of the Spitzer Space Telescope. 
This is an opportunity to help define the ways that SOFIA can best 
serve the scientific community. More information about the workshop 
can be found at:

PREPARING FOR THE INTERNATIONAL YEAR OF ASTRONOMY: 
A HANDS-ON SYMPOSIUM

May 31 to June 3, 2008
St. Louis, Missouri

The 120th Annual Meeting of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific,
cosponsored with, and part of, the 2008 Summer Meeting of the American 
Astronomical Society.

Includes:
* A symposium for education and outreach professionals
* Two days on hands-on demonstration workshops for diverse audiences.

For more information, see the meeting web site: 
http://www.astrosociety.org/2008meeting

At this meeting, education and outreach professionals will gather to 
discuss international, regional, and local programs for the 
International Year of Astronomy in 2009, which celebrates the 400th 
anniversary of the astronomical telescope. If you are interested in 
planning activities in 2009, this meeting is an excellent chance to 
learn more about what various institutions and organizations are 
proposing to do, and to coordinate your ideas with colleagues around 
the country and the world.  During the weekend, there will also be 
model workshops to demonstrate and develop techniques for reaching a 
wide range of audiences.
