PROPOSALS ENCOURAGED FOR AAS SUMMER MEETING TOPICAL SESSIONS

Have you thought of organizing a small meeting on a special topic but
were reluctant to face the bother of doing so?  The American
Astronomical Society can help.

It has been possible for many years to have a Topical Session at a
summer AAS meeting.  These consisted of either a half or full day of
sessions.  Special topic meetings are typically longer than a single
day, so the format of Topical Sessions has been changed to allow for
"Meetings Within the Meeting" (MWM) .  An MWM can run from one to
three, possibly even four days.

Think about it - you can organize a meeting with colleagues on a
topic of special interest to you by merely proposing to and getting
approval from the AAS to do so at an AAS summer meeting.  All the
logistics except for the selection of speakers will be handled by the
AAS.  Participants in your MWM simply register for the AAS meeting.

The deadline for proposals is December 15 of each year for the
following summer meeting.  See: 

www.aas.org/meetings  for details.

[Editor Note: Planetary topics are also welcome.]

REMINDER OF SPITZER CYCLE-5 PROPOSAL DEADLINE

A reminder that proposals for General Observations (GO), Guaranteed
Time Observations (GTO), and funding for Archival Research (AR) and
Theoretical Research (TR) are due by Friday, 16 November 2007, 
5:00 PM PST.

Cycle-5 is the last cryogenic cycle for Spitzer.

We draw your attention again to several new features and major changes
for Cycle-5.  Proposers should consult the Call for Proposals, issued
on 15 August. For details, see:

PHD POSITION TO STUDY MARTIAN DELTAS

The Faculty of Geosciences, Utrecht University, The Netherlands,
offers a PhD position - Lake delta and fluvial fan morphologies on Mars
as climate indicators - in a vibrant group as part of the departments
of Physical Geography and of Earth Science in cooperation with the 
German Aerospace Center (DLR) in Berlin. Highly motivated candidates
with an MSc degree in sedimentary geology, physical geography, civil
engineering, planetary geology or a related subject are encouraged to
apply. The candidate should have a proven record in laboratory and/or
modelling studies; remote sensing analyses and/or planetary morphology
is an asset but not a condition. Candidates who do not speak or 
understand Dutch are expected to be able to communicate in Dutch
within two years. The candidate is offered a fixed-term four year
appointment as PhD researcher with one year probation. The gross
monthly salary increases from EURO 1,956.- in year 1 to EURO 2,502.-
in year 4.
