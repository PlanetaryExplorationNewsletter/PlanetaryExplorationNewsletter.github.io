ANNOUNCING THE PLANETARY EXPLORATION NEWSLETTER

The Planetary Exploration Newsletter (PEN) is a weekly electronic mailing that 
is intended to be an open conduit of news and announcements across the entire
planetary science community. This includes astronomers, planetary scientists,
astrobiologists, geologists, atmospheric scientists and others doing planetary 
research. The desire is to cut across the boundaries of existing electronic 
newsletters to increase interdisciplinary awareness and distribute information
of broad professional interest.

PEN will contain messages from NASA and other officials, meeting announcements 
from professional societies, job announcements, and your submissions of news 
regarding or impacting solar system exploration, upcoming mission events, 
awards, Congressional deliberations on the NASA budget, policy issues, and 
assessments of program performance. There will be times when volume or events 
will require more frequent PEN distributions. 

An editorial board has been established that is open to representatives 
of professional societies, research organizations, and academic departments 
engaged in planetary science. This is to ensure the broadest possible 
participation, set policy and offer guidance to the editor.

NASA (April 27, 2007) - NEW POLICY FOR NASA SCIENCE MISSION DIRECTORATE 

The Science Mission Directorate has adopted a new policy concerning debriefings 
for proposers to Announcements of Opportunity (AO). Effective immediately, SMD 
will provide a written debriefing report to the proposer at the time of each 
proposal oral debriefing to the proposal team.  This policy applies to all 
future debriefs.

Questions about this policy may be directed to Dr. Paul Hertz, Science Policy 
Process and Ethics Chief, Science Mission Directorate, NASA, Washington, DC, 
20546; Phone 202-358-0986; Email paul.hertz@nasa.gov.

NASA (May 3, 2007) - MEET SARA (sara@nasa.gov)

Dr. Alan Stern, Associate Administrator for NASA's Science Mission Directorate,
has created an entirely new position within the Science Mission Directorate 
designed specifically to advise, adjust, and streamline NASA's Science Research 
and Analysis Programs to maximize the scientific return on NASA's investment. 
Dr. Yvonne Pendleton, an  infrared astrophysicist formerly at NASA Ames Research
Center, is the person tasked with this responsibility. She comes to the 
position  with the experience of many years as an active researcher within NASA,
and with the experience of serving as Chief of the Space Science and 
Astrobiology Division at NASA's Ames Research Center for  the past two years. 
Her new title is Senior Advisor for Research and  Analysis (SARA). The position 
is advisory directly to the Associate Administrator and  has oversight of the 
R&A activities across the directorate.

In order to improve communication between the science community and  the 
Science Mission Directorate, you can now send email to Yvonne at sara@nasa.gov. 
If you have an issue, complaint, concern (or praise!)  specific to a NASA 
Science R&A program, please contact the appropriate NASA program officer first. 
However, if your issue is of a more general nature, if you have not received a 
response within 24  hours, or the response requires elevation to a higher level,
please  contact Yvonne through the sara@nasa.gov address. The mail and your 
identity will be kept confidential. Information provided will be  used in a 
discrete manner to illuminate issues that can be fixed and to rectify 
communication problems if they exist. A web page devoted to R&A issues will be 
up shortly, and you will be notified through NSPIRES when this has occurred. 
After the web page is up and running, we will not use the NSPIRES system to 
further update the community. We will ask you to sign up on the web site for 
updates and thereby preserve the NSPIRES email list for its current purpose.

There will be SARA presentations at many of the upcoming scientific conferences,
including the AAS in May, Bioastronomy in July, the DPS in October, and the 
AGU in December. Look for updates from Yvonne  Pendleton at these meetings 
through the NASA night or town hall presentations.

Comments or questions regarding this informational notice should be addressed to
Dr. Yvonne Pendleton, Senior Advisor for Research and  Analysis, Science Mission
Directorate, NASA, Washington, DC, 20546;  Email: sara@nasa.gov.

CLEMENTINE NIR FULL-RESOLUTION LUNAR MOSAIC (VERSION 0.1) AVAILABLE

The Astrogeology Program of the U.S. Geological Survey is pleased to announce 
the availability of a full-resolution version of the Clementine near-infrared 
(NIR) lunar mosaic. Processed to 100 m/pixel spatial resolution, a PDS-compliant
image cube version (with detached ISIS labels) of this 6-band (1100 to 2780 nm)
multispectral mosaic can be downloaded via FTP on the USGS Astrogeology Research
Program web site.  This Preliminary Release (V 0.1) of the full-resolution 
mosaic marks the beginning of the review process by PDS peer reviewers. Users 
of these data should keep in mind that this version remains subject to revision
pending the outcome of this review process.

Web Site:  http://astrogeology.usgs.gov/Projects/ClementineNIR/

These full-resolution data are compatible with the previous PDS Clementine
UVVIS 'Full Resolution Digital Image Model' available through PDS Map-a-Planet 
(http://www.mapaplanet.org/explorer/moon.html) 
and the PDS Planetary Image Atlas 
(http://pds-imaging.jpl.nasa.gov/Admin/resources/cd_clementine.html#clmBASE).  
Once finalized, these multispectral data will also be available through these 
Web sites.
