[NASA] NEW PLANETARY R&A OPPORTUNITY

From: James L. Green, Director, Planetary Science Division, NASA SMD

I would like to call your attention to a new opportunity, joint with 
Heliophysics, which has recently been released within the ROSES-2007 
NASA Research Announcement. The new R&A opportunity is in appendix 
B.7 (LWS TR&T) section f and is entitled: Joint Focus Topics with 
Planetary Science: Extreme Space Weather Events in the Solar System.

The quest to understand extreme space weather events and their 
effects throughout the solar system presents a broad range of 
challenges in heliophysics and the planetary sciences. This new 
program seeks broadly interdisciplinary, first-cut modeling efforts 
that can contribute toward initiating future more detailed research 
in this area. It is anticipated that these studies will lead to a 
better understanding for the potential for life elsewhere in the 
solar system and the hazards and resources present as humans explore 
space. Both are key objectives in NASA's Planetary Science program.

Notices of Intent to propose are due September 19, 2007 and proposals 
are due October 19, 2007.

[NASA] CALL FOR NASA KECK TIME PROPOSALS

Due: 24 September 2007

NASA is soliciting proposals using the Keck Telescopes for the
entire 2008 observing year (Feb 2008 - Jan 2009). The majority of
the NASA Keck time will be dedicated to a Key Science project
to study exo-zodiacal emission around main sequence stars. Thus
the time allocated through the usual TAC process is greatly reduced
this year. This call includes proposals for the Key Science as well
as proposals in the following discipline areas: detection of 
extrasolar planets, origin and nature of planetary systems,
investigation of our own solar system and mission critical support.
The proposal process is being handled by the Michelson Science
Center at Caltech and all proposals are due on 24 September
2007 at 5pm PDT.

Please see the website at http://msc.caltech.edu for further
information on both the Key Science and single telescope proposals.

[NASA] 2008 SPITZER FELLOWSHIP GUIDELINES

Deadline: 1 November 2007

On behalf of NASA and the Spitzer Space Telescope Project, the
Spitzer Science Center (SSC) at Caltech is pleased to announce the 
release of the 2008 Spitzer Space Telescope Fellowship guidelines.
Fellowship applications are due 1 November 2007.

The Spitzer Space Telescope Postdoctoral Fellowship Program provides 
an opportunity for highly qualified recent postdoctoral scientists
to conduct independent research with the goal of enhancing the
overall scientific return from the Spitzer mission. This can be
accomplished through a proposal to conduct new observations with 
Spitzer, through exploitation of Spitzer archival databases,
or through research that aids in the interpretation of Spitzer 
results, including theoretical investigations and laboratory 
astrophysics. Research must be conducted at a U.S.-based Host
Institution chosen by the Fellow. Fellows will start their 
three-year research appointments in Autumn 2008. The SSC 
anticipates naming up to five new fellows. The complete application
guidelines are available at

http://ssc.spitzer.caltech.edu/geninfo/fellows/.

[NASA PDS] MARS RECONNAISSANCE ORBITER RELEASE 1 OF SHARAD DATA

The Planetary Data System announces the first release of data from
the SHARAD (Shallow Radar) instrument on board the Mars
Reconnaissance Orbiter. This release covers data acquired between
December 6, 2006, and January 6, 2007. SHARAD data can be accessed
from the PDS Geosciences Node web site:

http://pds-geosciences.wustl.edu/missions/mro/sharad.htm

and from the main PDS home page:

http://pds.nasa.gov.

For direct email announcements of future MRO releases from PDS, 
interested users must sign up via the Subscription Manager on the PDS 
home page. The next release of all MRO data sets is scheduled for 
September 7, 2007, with subsequent releases every three months.

SUBMILLIMETER ARRAY CALL FOR PROPOSALS

Deadline: 6 September 2007

The Submillimeter Array (SMA), the radio interferometer on Mauna Kea 
built by the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory and the Academia
Sinica Institute of Astronomy and Astrophysics, makes available a
fraction of the observing time to principal investigators from the
astronomical community (worldwide). The proposal deadline is 6
September 2007 for the observing semester 1 November 2007 through 30 
April 2008. SMA comprises of eight 6-m antennas operating at 
230 GHz, 345 GHz, 420GHz and 690 GHz bands. More information,
technical details, and instructions and tools for proposal 
preparation and submission can be found at the SMA Observer Center
web site:

GAS HYDRATES: GLOBAL AND PLANETARY RESERVOIRS FOR WATER AND CARBON

Abstract submissions investigating gas hydrates in planetary systems 
are invited for this session of the AGU meeting in San Francisco,
December 10-14, 2007. This session will examine the role of hydrates
in global-scale processes on Earth and throughout the Solar System,
including biogeochemical cycles, nutrient fluxes, and climate change.

Deadline: September 6.

Go to http://www.agu.org/meetings/fm07/

Gas hydrates are potentially the largest terrestrial reservoir for
hydrocarbon gases, forming within seafloor and permafrost sediments 
at elevated pressures and low temperatures. Gas hydrates may also
be major reservoirs for water and carbon on terrestrial and icy
bodies throughout the solar system. This session will focus on gas
hydrates at the global scale and their impact on global or planetary 
cycles and processes. Topics include the role of gas hydrates in 
carbon and water cycles, including distribution and fluxes; climate
change; and the potential for hydrates to act as sources or traps
for biogenic gases throughout the Solar System.

Session number GC06, cosponsored by Global Environmental Change,
Biogeosciences, Cryosphere, Ocean Sciences, Paleoceanography and
Paleoclimatology, Planetary Sciences

Conveners: Megan Elwood Madden (University of Oklahoma) and Patricia 
Taboado Serrano (Oak Ridge National Laboratory)

SAUCER-SHAPED SILLS, INJECTED SANDS AND RELATED STRUCTURES: FORMATION
MECHANISMS, EXAMPLES, AND EXTRA-TERRESTRIAL ANALOGUES

We would like to draw your attention to the special session V14 
described below for the next AGU fall meeting in San Francisco the 
10-14th December 2007 (http://www.agu.org/meetings/fm07/).

Deadline: September 6.
Submissions: http://submissions3.agu.org/submission/entrance.asp

Magma and fluidized sand can develop bowl- or saucer-shaped
structures that are increasingly recognized by field observations and 
by detailed seismic imaging in petroleum provinces (Nevada, 
California, Greenland, Siberia, Svalbard, South Africa, Norwegian
and North Sea Basins). The intrusions can affect organic matter
maturation, oil migration pathways, the plumbing systems of
hydrocarbon reservoirs, and they may also form aquifers. The aim
of this session is to investigate the origin of saucer-shaped 
intrusions and genetically related structures in terms of properties
of the crust and injected liquid, water and volatile contents,
and depth of emplacement of individual intrusions. We invite
contributions on saucer-shaped intrusions, either magmatic or
fluidized sand in origin, with their associated settings, 
deformation, peripheral structures and physical processes 
controlling their final geometry. Contributions on potential
extra-terrestrial analogues are welcome.

Conveners: Stephane Polteau (polteau@fys.uio.no), Joe A. Cartwright
(joe@ocean.cf.ac.uk) and Richard E. Ernst 
(Richard.Ernst@ErnstGeosciences.com).
