[NASA] NSPIRES: FUSE LEGACY SCIENCE PROGRAM CANCELLED

This amendment cancels the program element in Appendix D.11 entitled 
"FUSE Legacy Science Program."

The last operational reaction wheel on FUSE (Far Ultraviolet 
Spectroscopic Explorer) stopped on July 12. Attempts to restart any 
of the wheels have been unsuccessful. Although the instrument remains 
in excellent condition, the FUSE satellite is currently incapable of 
the fine pointing control required to continue its science mission, 
and there is no real prospect for recovering this capability. The 
NASA Science Mission Directorate has concluded that the scientific 
mission of FUSE is no longer viable and has decided to terminate the 
mission. The Astrophysics Division intends to place special emphasis 
on FUSE archival research in the 2008 Astrophysics Data Program that 
will be part of the 2008 ROSES proposal solicitation.

On or about September 7, 2007, this Amendment to the NASA Research 
Announcement "Research Opportunities in Space and Earth Sciences 
(ROSES) 2007" (NNH07ZDA001N) will be posted on the NASA research 
opportunity homepage at:

http://nspires.nasaprs.com/ 
(select "Solicitations" then "Open Solicitations" then "NNH07ZDA001N").

Further information about this program element is available from Dr. 
Hashima Hasan, Astrophysics Division, Science Mission Directorate, 
NASA, Washington, DC 20546-0001; Telephone: (202) 358-0692; E-mail:

[NASA] NSPIRES: PROPOSAL DUE DATE REMINDER FOR RESEARCH AND TECHNOLOGY 
DEVELOPMENT TO SUPPORT CREW HEALTH AND PERFORMANCE IN SPACE EXPLORATION

This notice is a reminder that Step-1 proposals for the Research and 
Technology Development to Support Crew Health and Performance in 
Space Exploration Missions NRA (NRA NNJ07ZSA002N) are due September 
14, 2007 at 5:00 PM Eastern Time. As specified in the NRA on pages 
NSPIRES-2 and 4, Step-1 proposals must be submitted by an official of 
the PI's organization after the PI has released the prepared proposal 
to the institution official.  It is strongly recommended that the PI 
work closely with his/her organization official to ensure the 
proposal is submitted by the due date and time listed in this 
solicitation. See 'open solicitations' at:

[NASA] PDS RELEASES LUNAR RADAR DATA SET

The Planetary Data System has released a new lunar radar data set 
provided by Bruce Campbell of the Smithsonian Institution's Center for
Earth and Planetary Studies. The data set is a dual-polarization 
calibrated radar map of the moon collected at 70 cm wavelength, using 
the 305-meter radio telescope at Arecibo to transmit and the NRAO's 
105-meter Robert C. Byrd Green Bank Telescope to receive. The data are
available from the PDS Geosciences Node at:
 
http://pds-geosciences.wustl.edu/missions/lunar_radar/

PLANETARY ATMOSPHERES WORKSHOP ABSTRACT DEADLINE *SEPTEMBER 11TH*

Reminder:  Abstracts for the Planetary Atmospheres workshop are due on 
Monday *SEPTEMBER 11th, 8am CDT*.

Location and date: Greenbelt, MD, November 6-7, 2007
Convenor: Phil Crane, NASA Headquarters

This professional workshop will highlight scientific research that 
falls under the traditional purview of the NASA Planetary Atmospheres 
Program. The main goals of the workshop are to facilitate communication
between atmospheres researchers; to provide opportunity for cross-
discipline interaction; to identify particular fields of interest in 
planetary atmospheres research for the next decade; and to stimulate 
theoretical, laboratory, and data-gathering activities in those 
critical fields. See:

http://www.lpi.usra.edu/meetings/patm2007/

The abstract deadline is Monday 8 am CDT. Late abstracts may still
be considered for poster space but will not be included in the printed
volume.

STATUS OF FY 2008 APPROPRIATIONS BILLS

PEN readers are directed to The American Institute of Physics Bulletin 
of Science Policy News at 

http://www.aip.org/fyi/2007/093.html

"The House and Senate returned to Washington yesterday, with less
than four weeks to go until the start of the new fiscal year.
The outlook for the completion of the FY 2008 budget cycle is
still very uncertain;  the only certainty is that it will not be
completed by September 30."

USGS and other agencies are linked in this bulletin.
