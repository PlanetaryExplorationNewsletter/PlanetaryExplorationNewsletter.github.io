[NASA] ASTROPHYSICS STRATEGIC MISSION CONCEPT STUDIES

[Editor Note: NASA astrophysics missions often conduct planetary 
investigations, and capabilities for conducting such studies is often
a factor in mission design.]

This amendment establishes a new program element in Appendix D.12 of 
ROSES-2007 entitled "Astrophysics Strategic Mission Concept 
Studies."  This new program element solicits concept studies for 
strategic space flight science missions that may be carried out in 
the next decade or for which technology development funding is sought 
in the next decade. These concept studies will be used for midterm 
and far-term forward planning of a diverse astrophysics mission 
portfolio and for obtaining a simultaneous and uniform assessment of 
future technology development needs for the Astrophysics Division. 
Study results and information related to the technical maturity of 
proposed mission components are expected to be provided as input to 
the panels convened by the National Research Council for the upcoming 
2010 Astronomy and Astrophysics Decadal Survey. Notices of Intent to 
propose are due September 20, 2007, and proposals are due 
November 20, 2007.

On or about August 22, 2007, this Amendment to the NASA Research 
Announcement "Research Opportunities in Space and Earth Sciences 
(ROSES) 2007" (NNH07ZDA001N) will be posted on the NASA research 
opportunity homepage at http://nspires.nasaprs.com/ (select 
"Solicitations" then "Open Solicitations" then "NNH07ZDA001N").

Eric P. Smith, Astrophysics Division, Science Mission Directorate, 
NASA, Washington, DC 20546-0001; Telephone: (202) 358-2439; E-mail:

WHITE HOUSE SETS FY09 RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT BUDGET PRIORITIES

PEN readers are directed to The American Institute of Physics Bulletin 
of Science Policy News at http://www.aip.org/fyi/2007/089.html

"Last week, Office of Science and Technology Policy Director John
Marburger and Office of Management and Budget Acting Director
Stephen McMillin sent a seven-page memo to the heads of executive
departments and agencies on the "FY 2009 Administration Research and
Development Budget Priorities."  This document reaffirms the
American Competitiveness Initiative as a Presidential Priority,
provides general R&D program guidance, outlines interagency R&D
priorities in nine areas, and briefly reviews the Administration's
ongoing R&D investment criteria."

TERRESTRIAL IMPACT CRATERING: NEW INSIGHTS INTO THE CRATERING PROCESS 
FROM GEOPHYSICS AND GEOCHEMISTRY

We would like to encourage submission of abstracts on any topic 
related to impact cratering (terrestrial and planetary) to Union 
Session U03, described below, at the Fall AGU meeting in San 
Francisco, December 10-14, 2007.

See details of the meeting at: http://www.agu.org/meetings/fm07/

The abstract submission deadline is 6 September 2007, 2359 UT.
Abstract Submissions at: 
http://www.agu.org/meetings/fm07/?content=program

Session Description:   Impact craters record important processes 
in the geologic history of the Earth, with effects ranging from
the formation of the Moon, to the production of environments
for rapid sedimentation, to the formation of structural traps for
oil, to the genesis of mass extinctions due to modification of 
the environment. Recent modeling efforts, analysis of materials 
recovered from drilling (e.g., Chesapeake Bay, Bosumtwi) have 
allowed new insights into the cratering process. Papers are
invited on all aspects of the cratering process, its signature
in the geologic record, and its influence on the environment.

Conveners: Jeff Plescia (APL-Johns Hopkins University; 
jeffrey.plescia@jhuapl.edu), and Christian Koeberl (University 
of Vienna, christian.koeberl@univie.ac.at).

THE PLASMA ENVIRONMENT OF SATURN, ITS SATELLITES AND RINGS

Planetary Sciences session P11 at the Fall AGU meeting in San 
Francisco, December 10-14, 2007 (http://www.agu.org/meetings/fm07/).

Conveners:   Tamas I. Gombosi (tamas@umich.edu)
             Kenneth C. Hansen (kenhan@umich.edu)
Sponsor:     Planetary Sciences
CoSponsor:   SPA - Magnetospheric Physics

Index Terms: 5737 5719 6270 6280 2756.

Description:
New results from the instrument suite on the Cassini spacecraft are
drastically changing our understanding of the intricate interplay 
between Saturn's magnetosphere and the plasma environments of its
satellites and rings. This session will focus on a synthesis of 
observations, models and theory. It will consist of a combination of 
invited and and contributed talks as well as posters.

Deadlines:
 - 6 September: Abstract Deadline for Electronic Submissions

EUROPEAN MARS SCIENCE AND EXPORATION CONFERENCE: MARS EXPRESS & 
EXOMARS

12-16 November 2007

ESA/ESTEC, Noordwijk, The Netherlands, by the European Space Agency.

After four years in orbit around the Red Planet, it is time to  
reflect on the many discoveries of Mars Express in all fields, from  
the Martian interior and subsurface structure to its surface  
morphology, geology and mineralogy, its atmospheric composition,  
dynamics and climate, and its interaction with the space environment.  
Also, preparations are gearing up for the next step in the European
exploration of Mars with the ExoMars mission, which comprises a  
capable rover devoted to astrobiological studies with access to the  
subsurface, and possibly a geophysical package and a scientific and  
communications orbiter.
