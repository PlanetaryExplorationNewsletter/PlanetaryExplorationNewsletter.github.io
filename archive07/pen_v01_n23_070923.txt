[SPECIAL] FROM JAMES GREEN, NASA PLANETARY SCIENCE DIVISION DIRECTOR -
DISCOVERY AND SCOUT MISSION CAPABILITIES EXPANSION PROGRAM

On Thursday, September 20, the Planetary Science Division released
a new ROSES 2007 opportunity that is looking for innovative Discovery
and Mars Scout mission concepts. The Discovery and Scout Mission
Capabilities Expansion (DSMCE) call solicits mission concept proposals
for low cost planetary missions that require a nuclear power source
such as the Advanced Stirling Radioisotope Generator (ASRG) currently
under development by NASA.  The DSMCE program is intended to foster
the formation of mission design teams, beginning the discussion of
necessary engineering trades, and discovering the breadth of missions
never before possible without the addition of the ASRG technology to
the Discovery and/or Scout programs. Mission design assistance for
these mission concepts will be offered by NASA during the 6 month
studies. Full details and mission concept parameters are available
in the solicitation, which is posted on the NSPIRES website
(http://nspires.nasaprs.com/; select "Solicitations" then "Open
Solicitations" then "NNH07ZDA001N," and look for the Discovery and
Scout Mission Capabilities Expansion program).

This is your chance to influence the future: if these missions are
sufficiently compelling NASA will consider expanding the mission
capabilities of the Discovery and Scout programs to include
radioisotope power systems. Full details are available in the
solicitation posted on NSPIRES. Please take a look at the
solicitation and contact Curt Niebur (curt.niebur@nasa.gov) if you
have any questions.

[NASA] SMD REQUESTS INFORMATION ON SPACE STATION UTILIZATION
(DEADLINE: OCTOBER 12)

The NASA Science Mission Directorate requests information on
potential small Earth and space science payloads that could be
deployed on the International Space Station (ISS). NASA is interested
in (i) potential investigations for ISS-utilization in the post-2010
timeframe and (ii) the identification of experiments that are
essentially ready-to-go and could be launched to the ISS in 2009 or
2010. In both cases, NASA is only interested in investigations,
payloads, and/or experiments that contribute to NASA's science
objectives in Earth and space science. This information will be used
to inform NASA's program planning, including consideration of whether
to solicit ISS-attached payloads in its Earth and space science 
program.

NASA has determined that there may be payload opportunities for small
Earth and space science payloads to be attached to the International
Space Station. Available external attach points include both zenith
and nadir pointing locations. NASA has available launch opportunities
in 2009 and 2010 on the Space Shuttle and annual launch opportunities
after 2010 on the Japanese HTV launch vehicle.

Solicitations" then "Request for Information (NNH07ZDA004R): 
Earth and Space Science Payloads on the International Space
Station".]

NASA 'SHOEMAKER FELLOW' RESEARCH POSITION AVAILABLE

The U.S. Geological Survey Astrogeology Team in Flagstaff, Arizona, 
has a two-year full-time research position (GS-12) now being posted 
online. Sponsored by the NASA Planetary Geology and Geophysics (PGG) 
Program, this position was created in honor of Gene Shoemaker and it 
is known as the NASA 'Shoemaker Fellow' at USGS.  The selected Fellow 
will work at the Astrogeology Program offices in Flagstaff on a 
variety of possible research projects in planetary science.  The 
position is funded for two years by NASA PGG and is managed and
supervised by the Astrogeology Team. The position will be open
from 9/19/07 to 10/21/07.

Please view Vacancy Announcement Number WR-2007-0590 for a position
as Geologist, Geophysicist or Physical Scientist:
