[NASA] NEW DUE DATES FOR EARTH SURFACE AND INTERIOR AND FOR EARTHSCOPE
PROPOSALS

The due dates for proposals submitted to two programs, the Earth 
Surface and Interior program element described in Appendix A.16 of 
ROSES-2007 and the EarthScope: The InSAR and Geodetic Imaging 
Component program element described in Appendix A.17 of ROSES-2007, 
have been changed. For both programs, the due date for submitting a 
proposal has been changed to November 26, 2007.

This change is being made in recognition of the severe difficulties 
that our colleagues in Southern California are experiencing due to 
wildfires and their attendant dislocations. This change will allow 
additional proposal preparation time for proposers who may have been 
impacted by the wildfires in Southern California. This delay is 
intended to allow adequate time for all proposers to prepare 
high-quality, responsive proposals. Proposers who were not affected 
by the wildfires and who are on schedule to have their proposals 
ready by October 25, 2007, for Earth Surface and Interior, and by 
November 9, 2007, for EarthScope, are encouraged to submit at that 
time so as to minimize any impact on their schedules.

Directorate, NASA, Washington, DC 20546-0001;

[NASA] NEW DUE DATE FOR OUTER PLANETS RESEARCH PROPOSALS

The due date for proposals submitted to the Outer Planets Research 
program element described in Appendix C.7 of ROSES-2007 has been 
changed. The due date for submitting a proposal has been changed from 
November 2, 2007, to November 16, 2007.

This change is being made in recognition of the severe difficulties 
that our colleagues in Southern California are experiencing due to 
wildfires and their attendant dislocations. This change will allow 
additional proposal preparation time for proposers who may have been 
impacted by the wildfires in Southern California. This delay is 
intended to allow adequate time for all proposers to prepare 
high-quality, responsive proposals. Proposers who were not affected 
by the wildfires and who are on schedule to have their proposals 
ready by November 2, 2007, are encouraged to submit at that time so 
as to minimize any impact on their schedules.

[NASA] BRIEFING IN SUPPORT OF DISCOVERY AND SCOUT MISSION CAPABILITIES
EXPANSION PROGRAM

On Monday, November 5, NASA will provide an informational briefing on 
the Advanced Stirling Radioisotope Generator (ASRG) technology 
currently under development.  This technology is being featured in 
the Discovery and Scout Mission Capabilities Expansion Program 
solicitation, which seeks to provide study funding in response to 
proposals for mission concepts utilizing up to two ASRG units.  The 
Discovery and Scout Mission Capabilities Expansion Program is 
described in Appendix C.26 of the ROSES-07 NASA Research 
Announcement. The solicitation may be found on NSPIRES at

http://nspires.nasaprs.com

(select "Solicitations" then "Open Solicitations" then "NNH07ZDA001N"
then "Table 2" or "Table 3" or "List of Program Elements" then 
"Discovery and Scout Mission Capabilities Expansion Program"). 

Proposals are due on November 30, 2007.

Attendance at the briefing is not necessary in order to provide a 
proposal in response to this program, but proposers may find the 
briefing beneficial.  The briefing will begin at 8 a.m. on November 5 
and will be held at NASA Headquarters in Washington, D.C.  The 
briefing will provide information on the design and operation of the 
ASRG and its operating environment.  The information being presented 
is export controlled and ITAR sensitive; thus, all attendees must be 
US citizens or permanent residents (hold green cards).  There is no 
fee for attending the workshop, but all attendees must pre-register 
by contacting Curt Niebur at curt.niebur@nasa.gov.

Division, Science Mission Directorate, NASA, Washington, DC

following data sets:

Recalibrated images of the Deep Impact mission 9P/Tempel 1 encounter 
from both the fly-by spacecraft and the impactor instruments. The data 
have been reprocessed using updated calibration and geometry data to 
produce these new data sets.

High-Resolution Imager Infrared (HRII) Images V2.0
High-Resolution Imager Visible CCD (HRIV) Images V2.0
Medium-Resolution Imager Visible CCD (MRI) Images V2.0
Impactor Target Sensor Visible CCD (ITS) Images V2.0

The NASA Planetary Data System announces the availability of the 
following data sets:

Meteoroid Orbits V1.0
http://www.psi.edu/pds/resource/metorb.html

This data set contains meteoroid orbits from photographic, TV system,
and radar meteoroid surveys collected from the International
Astronomical Union Meteor Data Center (IAU MDC) by Duncan Steel and
reviewed and discussed in Steel (1996). The data cover the time
period 1936-1983.

Asteroid Occultations V5.0
http://www.psi.edu/pds/resource/occ.html

This data set is intended to include all reported timings of observed
asteroid occultation events as well as asteroid occultation axes
derived from those timings by David W. Dunham and David Herald. Some
occultations by planetary satellites are also included. This version
is complete through the end of 2006, and contains additional events
from 2007.
