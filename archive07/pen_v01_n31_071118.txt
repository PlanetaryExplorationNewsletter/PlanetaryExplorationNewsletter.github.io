[NASA] HQ SEEKS VISITING ASTROPHYSICISTS (INCLUDING EXO-PLANET
EXPLORATION)

NASA's Science Mission Directorate (SMD) is seeking up to five 
experienced scientists to fill visiting scientist positions within 
the Astrophysics Division, NASA Headquarters, Washington, DC.  These 
positions are normally filled for two years, extendible to six years, 
by individuals on leave from their home institution.  Positions are 
available in the following science areas: 1) physics of the cosmos 
(exploring the fundamental physics of the universe and the extremes 
of space-time); 2) cosmic origins (the origins and evolution of 
stars, galaxies, and cosmic structure); and 3) exo-planet exploration 
(the search for and characterization of extra-solar planetary systems 
and potentially habitable environments around other stars).

Visiting scientists participate in the planning, development and 
management of NASA missions and in the management of the astrophysics 
grants program.  They serve as Discipline Scientists to develop 
research solicitations, conduct scientific peer reviews, and 
recommend highly rated proposals for selection, serve as Program 
Scientists for NASA space missions, and participate in the selection 
of Explorer missions. Visiting scientists play a leadership role in 
developing budgets, program plans, designing and participating in 
E/PO activities, and long range strategic plans to define the future 
NASA astrophysics program. They can make a difference in the 
execution of the overall SMD science mission and are expected to 
demonstrate a high degree of initiative in doing so.

Applicants must have a Ph.D. or equivalent in astronomy or physics 
plus relevant experience in instrumental, observational and/or 
theoretical research.  Applicants should be familiar with the U.S. 
grants programs and possess an ability to communicate effectively 
with the scientific community, educators, and the media.  Positions 
are available beginning March 2008, though the starting date is 
negotiable.  Expressions of interest should be forwarded to Sheila 
Gorham, Suite 3W39, National Aeronautics and Space Administration, 
Washington, DC  20546; sgorham@nasa.gov; 202-358-0032.

SPECIAL SESSION ON COMPARATIVE PLANETOLOGY

Contributions are solicited for a full-day Special Session on 
Comparative planetology: Exploring other world's by exploring Earth,
as part of the Joint Annual Meeting for the Geological Association of
Canada, the Mineralogical Association of Canada, the Society of
Economic Geologists, and the Society for Geology Applied to Mineral
Deposits, Quebec City, Quebec, Canada, May 26-28 2008. This will be
one of the largest conferences of its kind to be held in Canada in
recent years - during the year when Quebec City will celebrate its
400th anniversary!

Contributions are sought from those working in the fields of 
geobiology and astrobiology, comparative planetary geology,
cosmochemistry (meteorites). Submissions dealing with exploration
related activities are also welcome!
