[SPECIAL NASA MESSAGE] FROM JAMES GREEN: PHASE-2 OF THE OUTER PLANETS 
STUDIES

NASA Planetary Science Division is announcing that the Phase-2 studies 
for this next Outer Planets Flagship (OPF) will be Europa Explorer, 
Jupiter System Orbiter, and Titan Explorer. These studies will be 
carried out in cooperation with our ESA and JAXA partners over this 
next fiscal year. The new studies will concentrate on the findings from 
the technical reviews just completed in November. We are in the process 
of developing new ground rules plus the necessary programmatic changes 
that will be needed to include our international collaborators and are 
working to starting them as soon as possible in the New Year. Finally 
I want to again recognize all the members of the four original Phase-1 
study teams and the evaluation panels. Their diligent hard work is 
greatly appreciated. Without their tremendous support and unique 
scientific and technical skills we would not be at the threshold of 
defining the next OPF in step with our international partners. 
Congratulations to all!

[NASA] LCROSS ASTRONOMER WORKSHOP:  TRAVEL GRANTS AVAILABLE

The LCROSS mission will impact a permanently shadowed region at the 
Moon's south pole, creating an ejecta plume observable from both ground 
and space-based assets.  The LCROSS Astronomer Workshop (2/29/08) is 
designed for scientists interested in lunar exploration and aims to 
encourage the astronomy community to observe the LCROSS impacts to 
address scientific questions regarding the nature of polar hydrogen, 
impact cratering dynamics, polar regolith studies, etc. The data 
collected from these observational assets will complement data 
collected from the LCROSS Shepherding Spacecraft.

The LCROSS Project aims to provide as much LCROSS-relevant information 
to the astronomers as possible to assist with the planning of 
observations.  The LCROSS Observation Campaign Coordinator will also 
facilitate the submission of a NASA LASER (Lunar Advanced Science and 
Exploration Research) proposal next year to cover time and travel 
expenses incurred by astronomers who have submitted successful 
observing proposals.

TRAVEL GRANTS will be available to registered workshop participants.  
Funding for travel grants is provided by the Planetary Sciences 
Division at NASA Headquarters.  

Please visit the workshop website to view the agenda and to register 
for the workshop and travel grants:

[NASA] ANNOUNCES NEW PROPOSAL OPPORTUNITY ENTITLED "MOON AND MARS
ANALOG MISSION ACTIVITIES" (MMAMA)

NASA Analog Missions research addresses the need for integrated
interdisciplinary field experiments as an integral part of
preparation for planned human and robotic missions to the Moon and
Mars. The focus of this program will be on providing real scientific
investigations, scientific input, and science operations constraints
in the context of existing large-scale technology development and
testing activities being carried out by the Exploration Systems
Mission Directorate. Funding provided in this program element is
intended to supplement existing funded projects to enable researchers
to integrate their instruments, projects, and/or protocols into field
activities designed to help NASA achieve the Vision for Space 
Exploration.

Notices of Intent to propose are due January 17, 2008, and proposals
are due March 14, 2008.

39TH LUNAR AND PLANETARY SCIENCE CONFERENCE - SECOND ANNOUNCEMENT

The 39th Lunar and Planetary Science Conference will be held at the 
South Shore Resort and Conference Center in League City, Texas, 
March 10-14, 2008. This conference brings together international 
specialists in petrology, geochemistry, geophysics, geology, and 
astronomy to present the latest results of research in lunar and 
planetary science.
