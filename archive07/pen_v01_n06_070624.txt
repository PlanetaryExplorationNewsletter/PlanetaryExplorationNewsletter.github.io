AGU FELLOWS NOMINATION DEADLINE EXTENDED TO AUGUST 15

The deadline for the receipt of AGU Fellows nominations (see PEN Vol. 1,
Nr. 5, June 17, 2007) has been moved from 15 July to 15 August. This 
extended deadline provides more time to assure that all of the Sections 
and Focus Groups can be appropriately involved and participate 
effectively.

Processing time at AGU Headquarters will be trimmed to reduce the impact 
on the time allotted to the two sets of committee deliberations 
required.

Please encourage nominations. The goal is 200 for the first round of
which about 100 will be forwarded to the Fellows Committee.

Spread the word on the new date: 15 AUGUST.

PLANETARY MEETING PROPOSAL: PLEASE CONSIDER VOTING

Nic Richmond (nic@psi.edu, Planetary Science Institute, Tucson)

We have proposed an idea for the next MYRES meeting. MYRES is "Meeting 
of Young Researchers in Earth Sciences" (www.myres.org) and the theme 
for each meeting is chosen by the science community.

We are proposing a meeting on "Magmatism of the Earth and Planets". 
The goal of the meeting is to provide an overview of this field of 
research, promote scientific discussion and provide young scientists 
with the skills needed to become successful independent researchers. 
The proposed meeting includes science sessions, poster sessions and 
discussion groups, as well as a career development workshop and 
fieldtrips to volcanic sites near Flagstaff, central Arizona.

We need your support! Planetary science is a new topic to MYRES and we
need support from planetary scientists during the voting period.

Details of our proposal can be found here:

http://www.lpl.arizona.edu/~nic/index.html

The voting page can be accessed from the above site or it can be 
reached directly here:

Please consider voting for our meeting idea. Voting is open to the 
entire community; you don't have to be a young scientist to support 
our proposal.
