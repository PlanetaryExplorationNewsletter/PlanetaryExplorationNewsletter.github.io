[NASA] NSPIRES PROPOSAL SUBMISSION PROCESS BEING ENHANCED

NASA is making a change to the NSPIRES proposal submission process to 
ensure that a minimum set of required proposal cover page fields have 
been completed. Effective Friday, September 28, 2007 at approximately 
8am ET,  provision of the proposal summary and business data elements 
of the cover page will be necessary in order for the AOR to submit 
the proposal to NASA. If either of these two proposal elements are 
not completed,  the "View Proposal/ Check Elements" function of 
NSPIRES will display red "error" flags and messages to alert the user 
to the information that is required but missing,  and the "Submit 
Proposal" button will not be available.  The proposal cannot be 
submitted to NASA until these required fields are complete.  Any 
additional information that is missing will be identified by yellow 
"warning" flags.   In addition, please check the solicitation 
instructions to ensure that you comply with all instructions,  as 
adherence to these two element validation checks alone is 
insufficient to guarantee a compliant proposal.

NASA DAWN MISSION SUCCESSFULLY LAUNCHED

Dawn, the NASA Discovery Program's latest mission, was successfully 
launched from Cape Canaveral at 7:34 AM EDT on September 27. Dawn will
be using ion propulsion to rendezvous with the large asteroid Vesta
in 2011, followed by a second rendezvous with the small planet Ceres 
in 2015. A gravity assist in 2009 from Mars will help to sling Dawn
into the asteroid belt.

launch,go to:

SOFIA EARLY SCIENCE OPPORTUNITIES WORKSHOP

AAS WORKSHOP I,  JANUARY 8, 2008, AUSTIN, TX

The first in a series of workshops regarding early science 
opportunities with SOFIA (the Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared 
Astronomy) will be held during the AAS meeting in Austin, TX, 1-5 PM 
Tuesday, Jan. 8, 2008.

There will be updates on the status of the SOFIA program including 
its 9 instruments (3 cameras, 5 spectrometers, and a high-speed 
occultation photometer),followed by a charge to working groups that 
will meet in splinter sessions to consider the early SOFIA General 
Observer science plan and update SOFIA's scientific cases.  This work 
will provide input to a SOFIA Science Opportunities document to be 
reviewed at the SOFIA AAS Workshop II during the June 2008 AAS in St. 
Louis.

EVERYONE IS WELCOME. This is your chance to help define the ways that 
SOFIA will best serve the science community. We specifically 
encourage attendance by astronomers who have never had airborne 
astronomy experience. Refreshments will be provided.

COMET SURFACE SAMPLE RETURN OUTREACH SESSION AT DPS CONFERENCE

NASA is investigating the feasibility of a Comet Surface Sample Return
(CSSR) mission in advance of the next New Frontiers Announcement of
Opportunity (AO), which could be released as early as the fall of 2008.

NASA has tasked The Johns Hopkins University (JHU) Applied Physics
Laboratory (APL) to lead a detailed study to determine whether a CSSR
mission is indeed a viable candidate for New Frontiers.

NASA has also formed a CSSR Science Definition Team (SDT) to define 
the scientific objectives of a CSSR mission and work with the APL 
technical team to design a mission concept that can achieve those 
objectives.

In order to collect ideas, advice, and comments from the broader 
planetary community, the SDT is hosting an outreach session on 
October 11th (Thursday), during the Division of Planetary Science 
(DPS) meeting. The meeting will be held from 5:30pm to 7pm in Salon 17
of the Rosen Center.

Please bring your ideas to this meeting, so that we can help pave the
way to a NASA mission that will return to Earth for laboratory
investigation some of the solar system's most primitive material.

US SCIENCE AGENCY BUDGETS UNDER CONTINUING RESOLUTION

On September 29, 2007, the President signed into law a continuing 
resolution passed by Congress the previous day that extends federal
funding through November 16. The 2008 federal fiscal year begins 
October 1, 2007. The NASA budget may be tracked at

http://thomas.loc.gov/home/approp/app08.html

under Commerce/Justice/Science. Budgets have been passed by both the
House and Senate, with the House version specifically restoring funds
to NASA Research and Analysis programs. However, there is as yet no
resolution by a House/Senate Conference Committee.

EMBRACING EXOPLANETS WITHIN DPS

At the 2007 October 7 meeting of the DPS Committee, amendments to the
DPS bylaws and prize statements will be considered that formally 
include the study of exoplanets within DPS.  The sponsors of these
amendments present them and our reasoning, and solicit statements of
support, here:
