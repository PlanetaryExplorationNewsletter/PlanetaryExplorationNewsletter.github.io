[SPECIAL NASA MESSAGE] FROM ALAN STERN AND JAMES GREEN: 
MARS SCIENCE LABORATORY MISSION UPDATE

Dear Colleagues:

We are very happy to announce that MARDI and ChemCam's cost issues 
have been solved and both instruments are going forward to launch on 
MSL.

Malin Space Science Systems has agreed that there will be no 
additional costs to NASA for the completion of the Mars Descent 
Imager (MARDI).  Furthermore, funds returned to the Mars Exploration 
Program from the unfortunate elimination of MARDI operations on 
Phoenix will be used to support MARDI integration on MSL.

In the case of ChemCam, LANL, the French Space Agency (CNES), and 
even other MSL instrument team members have developed a series of 
descopes and support arrangements to allow instrument completion, 
reducing the development cost-to-go by a little over  80%--i.e., from 
$2.5M to about $400K. As a result, ChemCam will be funded another 
$400K by the Mars exploration Program, allowing them to complete 
development.

This outcome is even better than we had imagined possible in 
September, when MARDI was descoped and ChemCam was cost capped to 
save money so that MSL itself could complete development without 
raiding other missions or R&A.

We thank MSSS, LANL, and JPL for their diligence and hard work in 
finding solutions to these payload issues.  We also thank the 
community for their support of the Mars Exploration Program, the MSL 
mission, and for the concept of containing costs on one mission so as 
not to jeopardize others.  The support of the NAC in commending our 
cost control efforts in SMD is also very much appreciated.

MSL's launch is now just 21 months away! Though there remain many 
challenges ahead, the mission remains as exciting as ever, and we can 
celebrate that that highly anticipated return will not come at the 
expense of other SMD projects or R&A grants.

Sincerely,
Alan Stern and Jim Green
NASA Headquarters

NASA ADMINISTRATOR GRIFFIN TO SPEAK AT UPCOMING 39TH LPSC

The Lunar and Planetary Institute (LPI) is pleased to announce the
upcoming 39th Lunar and Planetary Science Conference (LPSC). This
year's meeting will highlight NASA's renewed emphasis on lunar
activities.

Special sessions will focus on the current state of lunar knowledge,
new and current missions to the Moon, and lunar network science.

LPSC will also feature Dr. Michael Griffin, NASA's current 
Administrator, as the Monday evening keynote speaker.

The lunar focus for the 39th LPSC is especially timely in light of
its coincidence with the LPI's 40th anniversary. The Institute was
established in 1968 during the Apollo missions to create a new lunar
and planetary science community, and over the past four decades has
served as an international leader and focal point for what is now a
diverse and thriving community. We are pleased to celebrate this
important milestone with the community as we look forward to NASA's
return to the Moon.

LPSC will be held March 10-14, 2008, at the South Shore Harbor Resort
and Conference Center, League City, Texas. This conference brings
together international specialists in petrology, geochemistry,
geophysics, geology, and astronomy research in lunar and planetary
science.

PLANETARY COMMUNITY INPUT ON SOFIA SCIENCE GOALS REQUESTED

The Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy (SOFIA) is a 
2.5-meter telescope aboard a Boeing 747-SP aircraft with instruments 
designed to make sensitive, high-angular resolution measurements over 
0.3 microns to 1.6 mm. It is scheduled to begin science operation in 
2009. The SOFIA Science Advisory Committee is requesting input from 
the planetary science community to articulate major science themes and
how SOFIA can uniquely address any of them. In your opinion, what are
the five or six most important questions that may be addressed by this 
facility?

Information about the initial instruments can be seen at:

http://www.sofia.usra.edu/Science/instruments/sci_instruments.html

Please send your responses to sykes@psi.edu.

Your input is much appreciated. Thank you!

155TH MEETING OF THE ACOUSTICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA, PARIS 2008: FIRST 
ANNOUNCEMENT

Of interest to the planetary community is the session ACOUSTIC PROBES
OF PLANETARY ENVIRONMENTS, which is intended to bring together the 
terrestrial acoustics and the planetary science communities. 

Topics of discussion in previous sessions included, for example,
acoustic modelling in planetary atmospheres, results from previous
missions, current and planned instrumentation, and terrestrial
techniques that would be applicable on other planets. The planetary 
acoustic environment includes study of the atmospheres, liquids and
also the solid surface.

A formal call for papers will be issued in late 2007.

Progress and White Paper (Dr. Emily CoBabe-Ammann, University of
Colorado and Dr. David Klumpar, Montana State University, chairs)

2:30-3:30: Short community-member presentations that highlight the
wide variety of Student Collaborations.

3:30-6:00: Open discussion.

Anyone interested in presenting a 5-10 minute overview on a specific
Student Collaboration should contact:
Emily CoBabe-Ammann (ecobabe@lasp.colorado.edu) or 
David Klumpar (klump@physics.montana.edu).

The NASA/SMD Student Collaborations Definition Team White Paper will be
released on November 16th and available at
