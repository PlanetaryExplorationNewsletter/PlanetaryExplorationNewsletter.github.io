two largest objects in the asteroid belt in an effort to answer 
questions about the formation of our solar system, has been 
rescheduled to September.

FIRST INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON THE EXPLORATION OF PHOBOS AND DEIMOS

November 5-8, 2007
NASA Ames Conference Center, Moffett Field, California

The First International Conference on the Exploration of Phobos and
Deimos:  The Science, Robotic Reconnaissance, and Human Exploration of 
the Two Moons of Mars, to be held November 5-8, 2007, will be the first
international meeting focused specifically on Phobos and Deimos, and on 
how their exploration relates to that of Mars and the solar system. The
conference will be an open international forum that gathers scientists,
engineers, space exploration professionals, and students interested in
discussing the status and advancement of the exploration of Mars'
satellites, and the exploration of Mars itself through them.
