[EDITOR NOTE] PEN DOWN THEN BOUNCES BACK

In the course of upgrading the PEN server operating system, some PEN
mailman files were not backed up and required reconstruction, including 
our subscriber list. It delayed this release of PEN by a day and about 
a dozen subscribers were lost and will need to resubscribe at

http://planetarynews.org/pen_subscribe.html

We apologize to those subscribers and to all for the delay. Procedures 
are now implemented to avoid a repetition.

[NASA] APPLIED INFORMATION SYSTEMS RESEARCH PROPOSAL DUE DATE 
DELAYED A FEW MONTHS

The proposal due date for "Applied Information Systems Research" is
defered a few months, moving the program from ROSES-2007 to ROSES-2008. 
The ROSES-2008 NASA Research Announcement will be released in early 
2008. Funding anticipated to be awarded through the Applied Information 
Systems Research program element remains unchanged.

and select "Solicitations" then "Open Solicitations" then 
"NNH07ZDA001N".

PLANETARY SCIENCE SUBCOMMITTEE NOTES FROM OCTOBER 7, 2007

The Planetary Science Subcommittee of the NASA Advisory Council (NAC) 
reports to the Science Committee of the NAC. Regular meetings are 
held for the purpose of soliciting from the scientific community and 
other persons scientific and technical information relevant to 
program planning. Presentations from the Subcommittee meetings are
posted on this unofficial site:

http://www.lpi.usra.edu/pss/

Notes from the meeting held in Orlando, Florida, on October 7, 2007,
are now available from the above webiste.

NOAO SEEKS INPUT ON THE FUTURE DEVELOPMENT OF SMALL AND MID-SIZE 
TELESCOPE CAPABILITIES

[Editor Note: Solar System studies are explicitly included in this 
survey.]

NOAO, responding to the NSF Senior Review, has chartered a new 
committee, called Renewing Small Telescopes for Astronomical Research
(ReSTAR), to develop a prioritized, quantitative, science-justified
list of instrumental and operations capabilities appropriate to 
telescopes with apertures less than 6 meters, together with estimates
of the number of observing nights needed. The committee must both
address near-term needs and uses of such telescopes, and attempt to
predict how these needs will evolve over the next ten years into the
era of Pan-STARRS, LSST, JWST, ALMA, GSMT and the NVO.

To complete its challenging task, this committee needs input from 
you and your colleagues on the telescope performance and instrument
capabilities that you need to accomplish your science!

The Committee takes the "Renewing" part of its name seriously - new
telescopes, modernization of existing telescopes, and new 
instrumentation are all possible. In thinking about the instruments
and observing modes needed on small (under 2-m) and midsize 
(2- to 5-m) telescopes to carry out your exciting science programs
in the next 10 years, think broadly. Our blueprint for the future
system of small and mid-sized telescopes should not be constrained 
by existing instrumentation and the limitations of existing
telescopes.

FINAL ANNOUNCEMENT - ASTROPHYSICS 2020: LARGE SPACE MISSIONS BEYOND
THE NEXT DECADE

Contributed talks and posters are welcome but the number of slots is 
now very limited. Indeed, only one contributed talk slot remains but 
there are quite a few slots available for posters. If you are
interested in presenting your results, please register as soon as
possible or contact Marc Postman (postman@stsci.edu).

AGU UPCOMING DEADLINES

The 2008 Joint Assembly session proposal deadline is 31 October.  To
submit a proposal go to http://www.agu.org/meetings/ja08/program.html.
This is "A Meeting of the Americas" to promote cooperative efforts
among AGU and other scientific societies in Americas.  The meeting
will be held in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, 26-30, May.

The deadline for submitting session proposals for the 2008 Western
Pacific Geophysics Meeting is 30 November 2007. The meeting takes
place in Cairns, Australia, 29 July - 1 August.
http://www.agu.org/meetings/wp08/program.html

The 2008 Fall Meeting housing and registration deadline is November
9. The last day to take advantage of the early registration fees is
November 2. Do not forget to purchase your honors banquet and section
event tickets. The meeting program will be posted in a few days.

LLOYD V. BERKNER SPACE POLICY INTERNSHIPS 2008

As part of its celebration of the 50th anniversary of its founding,
the National Research Council's Space Studies Board (SSB) has expanded
the scope of the Space Policy Intern program it has operated since
1992 by initiating the Lloyd V. Berkner Space Policy Internships.
The goal of the program is to provide promising undergraduate and
graduate students with the opportunity to work in the area of civil
space research policy in the Nation's capital, under the aegis of the
SSB. The Lloyd V. Berkner Space Policy Internships are offered
twice annually. The summer program is restricted to undergraduates
and the autumn program is open to both undergraduate and graduate
students. The deadline for applications for the summer 2008
program is January 15, 2008. The deadline for applications to
the autumn program is June 16, 2008.

Additional details, including eligibility criteria and application
procedures, can be found at:

POSTDOC IN LUNAR GEOLOGY AND GEOCHEMISTRY AT MARSHALL SPACE FLIGHT 
CENTER

NASA Postdoc in Lunar Geology and Geochemistry
Marshall Space Flight Center
Huntsville, AL 35816
https://www2.orau.gov/nasacatalog/Listing.aspx?Opportunity=18395

Postdoctoral opportunity to conduct original research on the geology  
and/or geochemistry of lunar surface materials, including, but not  
limited to, theoretical investigations, numerical modeling of  
physical/chemical processes, experimental/laboratory investigations  
and field analog studies. Projects linking basic lunar science to  
exploration activities such as in-situ resource utilization, regolith  
simulant studies, or lunar mapping activities are synergistic with  
ongoing efforts at MSFC and are especially welcome. In addition to  
conducting fundamental research, the appointee will have an  
opportunity to participate in next-generation lunar instrumentation  
concepts, mission concepts, and observations. Available analytical  
facilities include electron microscopy (scanning electron microscopy,  
electron microprobe, and transmission electron microscopy), secondary- 
ion mass spectrometry, and dusty plasma lab. Previous lunar science  
experience is not necessary. Application deadline is Nov. 1, 2007.  
Interested applicants should apply online and also contact Dr.  
Barbara Cohen (bcohen@unm.edu) directly to discuss potential projects.

MRO HIRISE POST-DOCTORAL POSITION

The Astrogeology Team of the U.S. Geological Survey in Flagstaff, 
Arizona has an opening for full-time, term research scientist in 
Geology or Geophysics at the GS-12 to GS-13 grade levels 
(approximately equivalent to Post-Doctoral Fellow to Assistant
Professor).  Starting annual salary range is $63,417 to $75,414.

The Astrogeology Team specifically requires additional personnel to 
support the High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment (HiRISE) 
onboard the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO).  The applicant
should have prior experience in planning imaging observations of
Mars (especially participation in mission operations), radiometric
calibration of imaging systems, and geologic interpretation of Mars
data, with emphasis on either polar, volcanic, or tectonic processes. 
The applicant will also conduct an independent research program in
planetary science via externally funded grants.
