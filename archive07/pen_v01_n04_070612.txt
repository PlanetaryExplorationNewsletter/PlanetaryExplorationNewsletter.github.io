NASA ANNOUNCEMENT

NSPIRES: NEW PROPOSAL OPPORTUNITY FOR LRO PARTICIPATING SCIENTISTS

This amendment establishes a new program element in Appendix C.25 
entitled "Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) Participating 
Scientists."  This new program element solicits proposals for LRO 
Participating Scientists. LRO Participating Scientists will serve as 
members of the LRO Science Team and will participate in LRO Science 
Team activities such as data analysis, archiving, and publication. 
For this LRO Participating Scientists program, NASA is soliciting 
science investigations using the LRO spacecraft during the one year 
exploration mission as well as during the science mission following 
the completion of the exploration mission. Notices of Intent to 
propose are due July 16, 2007, and proposals are due September 7, 2007.

On or about June 12, 2007, this Amendment to the NASA Research 
Announcement "Research Opportunities in Space and Earth Sciences 
(ROSES) 2007" (NNH07ZDA001N) will be posted on the NASA research 
opportunity homepage at http://nspires.nasaprs.com/ (select 
"Solicitations" then "Open Solicitations" then "NNH07ZDA001N").

Further information about this program element is available from Dr. 
Kelly Snook, Planetary Science Division, Science Mission Directorate, 
NASA, Washington, DC 20546-0001; Telephone: (202) 358-2302; E-mail:

FIRST WORKSHOP ON BINARIES IN THE SOLAR SYSTEM (AUGUST 20-23, 2007),
STEAMBOAT SPRINGS, COLORADO

The goal of this workshop is to bring together various ideas on 
detection, characterization, and formation of binary and multiple 
objects among the NEO, main-belt, Trojan, and TNO populations.
The venue is a small (pop. 10,000) ski-resort village in the Colorado 
Rocky Mountains. The workshop will be over 2.5 days ... full days on 
Aug 21 & 22 and a half day on Aug 23. This will leave the remainder of 
the day on Aug 23 for anyone who wishes to participate in the field 
trip to an exposure of the KT boundary layer in southern Colorado on 
the morning of Friday Aug 24. We ask that anyone interested in the 
meeting should indicate immediately their interest (if you have not 
already done so) by responding in the manner below. This will be the 
last mailing to the general community.  All future mailings will be 
only to those who've responded. Registration will open soon for the 
hotel.  Agenda and details for presentations will be forthcoming 
shortly. A developing web page, with the first announcement, which 
contains more details can be found at:

FIRST RELEASE OF MARS RECONNAISSANCE ORBITER DATA BY PDS

On June 8, 2007, the Planetary Data System announced its first release 
of science data from the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO) mission. 
The release includes data acquired during areobraking, transition, and 
typically the first 30 days of observation, November 8 - December 7, 
2006. Data sets from these experiments are now available: CRISM 
(Compact Reconnaissance Imaging Spectrometer for Mars), HiRISE (High 
Resolution Imaging Science Experiment), Gravity/Radio Science, CTX 
(Context Imager), MARCI (Mars Color Imager), MCS (Mars Climate Sounder), 
and the Accelerometer. Data from SHARAD, the Shallow Radar experiment, 
will also be released shortly as the team resolves processing 
problems encountered during the early days of mapping. SPICE kernels 
for all instruments are available.

MRO data are archived at the PDS Geosciences, Imaging, Atmospheres, 
and NAIF Nodes, and can be accessed from these nodes' web sites and 
from the main PDS home page, http://pds.nasa.gov. Interested users 
should  use the Subscription Manager on this site to subscribe to email 
announcements of future MRO releases. The next release will occur in 
September 2007, with subsequent releases every three months.

DAWN SCIENCE SYMPOSIUM, JUNE 28-30, COCOA BEACH, FLORIDA

The Dawn science team is hosting a symposium at the Cocoa Beach Hilton
in parallel with the last days of readying the spacecraft for launch
(now scheduled for July 7 with a five day window). The topics will 
include: Dawn mission overview; Physical and Chemical Properties of 
Ceres; Geology and Geophysics of Vesta; the Mineralogy, Petrology
and Geochemistry of Vesta; Planet formation; and more. Contributed 
oral and poster presentations are welcome. Please send your proposed 
title to Carol Raymond at Carol.A.Raymond@jpl.nasa.gov. Registration 
for the conference is $180 for the three days of the symposium. Rooms 
may still be available at the Cocoa Beach Hilton at a rate of $105 
plus tax per night. Go to

SEEKING NOMINATIONS FOR COSPAR AWARDS AND MEDALS

The Committee on Space Research (COSPAR) is seeking nominees for 
various awards and medals which recognize the outstanding achievements 
of space scientists throughout the world.  Details of the awards and 
past recipients can be found at 

http://cosparhq.cnes.fr/Awards/awards.htm  

Awards will be presented at the 37th COSPAR Scientific Assembly to be 
held in Montreal, Canada, July 13-20, 2008.

Nomination forms can be obtained from David H. Smith (dhsmith@nas.edu) 
at the National Research Council, Space Studies Board (SSB), which is the 
U.S. adhering body to COSPAR.  All nominations will be processed by the 
SSB.  Completed nomination packages must be submitted to the SSB no later 
than SEPTEMBER 28, 2007.
