[NASA] ADMINISTRATOR ANNOUNCES SENIOR LEADERSHIP APPOINTMENTS

WASHINGTON - On Friday, NASA Administrator Michael Griffin named 
Richard J. Gilbrech as associate administrator for the Exploration 
Systems Mission Directorate, the NASA division designing the next 
generation of spacecraft to return astronauts to the moon and 
eventually journey to Mars. Gilbrech currently serves as the 
director of NASA's Stennis Space Center in Mississippi. Griffin 
also named Robert D. Cabana, deputy director of NASA's Johnson Space 
Center in Houston, to replace Gilbrech as center director at Stennis.

[NASA] OFFICE OF EDUCATION UNDERGRADUATE STUDENT RESEARCH PROGRAM

NASA's Office of Education, in cooperation with the NASA Johnson 
Space Center is requesting proposals for a NASA Cooperative Agreement 
Notice, Undergraduate Student Research Program (USRP).   It has been 
released and is available through the NASA Research Opportunities 
homepage at 

http://nspires.nasaprs.com/ 

and then linking through the menu listings "Solicitations" to "Open 
Solicitations."

Organizations eligible to respond to this CAN are limited to higher 
education institutions and non-profit organizations serving higher 
education students.  Partnerships among these institutions and/or 
organizations are encouraged to apply.

The NASA USRP is one of NASA's workforce development projects for 
undergraduate students.  It will incorporate science, technology, 
engineering, and mathematics (STEM) activities of each of NASA's 
field centers and the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL).  Undergraduate 
students selected for this program will undertake research 
internships at NASA field centers under the tutelage of NASA 
scientists and engineers.

SECOND MAGELLAN SCIENCE SYMPOSIUM (2ND ANNOUNCEMENT)

The Second Magellan Science Symposium will be held at the 
Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics (CfA) on 29-30 October
2007 at the CfA. Deadlines are approaching and we urge you to 
register and submit your abstract.

This is an open meeting, so any interested parties are welcome to 
attend, however admission will be restricted to individuals who
pay the registration fee, which covers coffee breaks and spectacular
lunches.

Please go to:

http://cfa-www.harvard.edu/events/2007/smss/

for details.

We have blocked rooms at the Sheraton Commander and the Tria Hotel, 
however these will only be blocked until approximately the last week
in September.

We urge attendees, at their earliest convenience, to register for 
the symposium & banquet, submit an abstract and make a room
reservation. Space is limited.

The rack rate for a hotel room in the Boston area in October can be
very high and choices will be extremely limited. If you would like 
to explore some alternatives, we list a number of B&B's and hotels
on the Symposium accommodations page.

We expect this to be an exciting meeting and look forward to seeing 
you in Cambridge in October.

[Editor Note: The program includes talks on Exoplanets (transits and
spectroscopy of host stars) and Neptune Trojan Asteroids.]

LABORATORY INVESTIGATIONS RELATED TO ANALYSES OF MARS DATA

The Fall 2007 AGU Meeting will be held in San Francisco, CA from 
December 10-14. Pre-planned sessions were recently announced, and 
co-conveners Timothy Glotch (Stony Brook University) and Joel Hurowitz 
(JPL) would like to encourage submissions to their proposed session. 
The session is described below and is also available at

http://www.agu.org/meetings/fm07/?content=search. 
Due-dates for abstract submission are Sept. 6.

Laboratory investigations are key to correctly interpreting data 
returned from space missions. This session will focus on results from 
laboratory studies designed to aid in analysis of remotely sensed or 
in situ data acquired by past, currently active, and upcoming Mars 
missions. Examples include laboratory spectroscopic investigations that 
aid in interpretation of data from TES, THEMIS, OMEGA, CRISM, and other 
orbital spectrometers, or Mini-TES and Pancam data acquired by the MER 
Rover missions. Other examples include laboratory geochemical studies 
that will aid in the interpretation of MER APXS and Mossbauer data or 
future Mars Science Laboratory APXS, CheMin, ChemCam, and SAM data. 
Cross-disciplinary studies that make use of multiple measurement 
techniques and data sets are especially encouraged.

A NEW SPIN ON SATURN? RECENT RESULTS OF THE ATMOSPHERE AND INTERIOR
FROM CASSINI AND EARTH-BASED OBSERVATIONS

Abstract submissions are invited for this session of the AGU meeting in 
San Francisco, December 10-14, 2007. This session highlights new 
discoveries and developments in our understanding of the interior, 
atmosphere, and ionosphere of Saturn. 

Deadline: September 6. 
Go to http://www.agu.org/meetings/fm07/

Description:  New advances in understanding the enigmatic rotation 
rate of Saturn and the nature of Saturn's circulation, dynamics, 
aurorae, and chemistry have been made during this third year of Cassini 
Orbiter investigations. This session focuses on new observations and 
results dealing with Saturn's interior and atmosphere utilizing the 
comprehensive suite of instruments onboard the Cassini orbiter. Both 
invited and contributed presentations on these topics will be 
highlighted. Recently obtained Cassini observations will be emphasized, 
but observations from Earth and HST, and theoretical models are also 
welcome.
 
Looking forward to a great Saturn Session,

Conveners:  Kevin H. Baines (blueskies4321@yahoo.com)
and Christopher T.  Russell (ctrussell@igpp.ucla.edu)
