NASA ANNOUNCEMENT

NSPIRES: NSBRI POSTDOCTORAL FELLOWSHIP PROGRAM SOLICITING APPLICATIONS

The National Space Biomedical Research Institute (NSBRI) is soliciting 
applications for its Postdoctoral Fellowship Program. Two-year 
fellowships are available in any U.S. laboratory carrying out 
space-related biomedical or biotechnological research that supports 
the NSBRI's goals.  NSBRI research addresses and seeks solutions to 
the various health concerns associated with long-duration human space 
exploration.

Applicants must submit proposals with the support of a mentor and 
institution, and all proposals will be evaluated by a peer-review 
panel. The program is open to U.S. citizens, permanent residents, or 
persons with pre-existing visas obtained through their sponsoring 
institutions that permit postdoctoral training for the project's 
duration.

Detailed program and application submission information is available 
on the NSBRI Web site at 

http://www.nsbri.org/Announcements/rfa07-02.html 

Notices of intent and applications must be submitted through the 
NASA Solicitation and Proposal Integrated Review and Evaluation 
System (NSPIRES).  Notices of intent are due July 10, 2007, and the 
application deadline is August 1, 2007.

Questions may be directed to Sonia Rahmati Clayton, Ph.D., Program 
Coordinator, NSBRI Postdoctoral Fellowship Program, email:
postdoc@www.nsbri.org, or phone: 800-798-8244
