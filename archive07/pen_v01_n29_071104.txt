[SPECIAL NASA MESSAGE] FROM JAMES GREEN AND DENIS BOGAN: BROADENED 
JUPITER DATA ANALYSIS PROGRAM

At the recent DPS meeting it was announced that the New Horizons 
Jupiter Data Analysis Program (NHJDAP) would be broadened to include 
the analysis of older data in the Jupiter system, not just from the 
New Horizons mission.  This is appropriate in that the Galileo 
mission data returned after calendar year 2000 was never open to a 
Data Analysis Program.  Furthermore the planetary community has been 
greatly stimulated by the new Flagship studies in the Jupiter system 
and this provides a perfect opportunity to support further mission 
studies in this area.

In order to have the Planetary Data System nodes prepare for analysis 
of the older data and complete the ingesting of all the recent New 
Horizons Jupiter system encounter data, our plan is to release both the
Cassini DAP and the revised JDAP calls in ROSES 2008 as early in the 
year as possible (February 2008).  The due dates will be separated by 
2-4 weeks to facilitate PIs proposing to both.   The due dates will 
be in the May timeframe with a review panel meeting in the summer. 
Please carefully check the upcoming NSPIRES announcements and program 
calls for additional details or contact James Green 
(james.green@nasa.gov) or Denis Bogan (dbogan@nasa.gov).

AGU 2008 JOINT ASSEMBLY DEADLINE FOR SESSION PROPOSALS

The Joint Assembly will be 26-30 May 2008 in Fort Lauderdale, Florida
and will continue to build on the theme of A Meeting of the Americas. 
This theme is to promote cooperative efforts among the AGU and other 
scientific societies in the Americas. As such, we encourage sessions 
focusing on scientific topics of current interest, particularly to 
the Americas. The Assembly is typically a moderate-sized meeting that 
allows for a higher fraction of oral presentations than can 
typically be accommodated at the AGU Fall Meeting.

Don't forget to submit your session proposal by 5 November. 
Instructions can be found at:

http://www.agu.org/meetings/ja08/program.html

NEW FACULTY OPENINGS AT UCLA

UCLA is launching an initiative to grow its geosciences program under
the theme "Surface Envelopes of Earth and Planets: Processes and
Interactions". Appointments will be made in the Atmospheric and
Oceanic Sciences, Earth and Space Sciences and the Institute of 
Geophysics and Planetary Physics. Candidates are sought in eight
specific areas: Atmospheric Science; Planetary Science; Biogeoscience;
Land Surface Processes; Planetary Atmospheres; Environment; Surface
Processes and Climate; Solar Variability. Consideration of 
applications begins December 17, 2007.
