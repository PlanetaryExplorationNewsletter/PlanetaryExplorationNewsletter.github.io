[SPECIAL NASA MESSAGE] FROM JAMES GREEN: DISCOVERY AND SCOUT 
MISSION CAPABILITIES EXPANSION PROGRAM

Recall that in the September 23rd PEN I had alerted everyone of a 
new special ROSES 2007 opportunity: Discovery and Scout Mission 
Capabilities Expansion (DSMCE). The DSMCE call solicited mission 
concept proposals for low cost planetary missions that require an 
Advanced Stirling Radioisotope Generator (ASRG) power system that 
is currently under development by NASA. That request for proposals 
ended on November 30th. I wanted to take this opportunity to let you 
know the response was fantastic!  We received about 40 proposals, 
composed roughly of 1/4 outer solar system, 1/4 inner solar system, 
and 1/2 Mars/Moon. We are working towards getting them evaluated, 
selected, and awarded as fast as we can. Thanks for your great 
response.

[NASA] TO RELEASE COOPERATIVE AGREEMENT NOTICE FOR MEMBERSHIP IN
THE NASA ASTROBIOLOGY INSTITUTE

NASA intends to release a Cooperative Agreement Notice (CAN, Cycle-5)
soliciting new institutional members to the NASA Astrobiology 
Institute (NAI). The CAN will be released early in 2008, and 
proposals will be due approximately 90 days later. NAI CAN 
Cycle-5 is responsive to the recommendations of the recent
NRC study (Assessment of the NASA Astrobiology Institute, 2007, 
http://www7.nationalacademies.org/ssb/).

Proposals will be required to clearly articulate an innovative,
interdisciplinary, astrobiology research program, together with plans 
to advance the full scope of NAI objectives as defined in the 
Institute's Mission Statement (see NAI website: http://nai.nasa.gov/).
NASA anticipates making $4-11M per year available for this selection, 
leading to 4-8 awards, each of 5 years duration. Participation
in this solicitation is open to all categories of organizations,
domestic and non-U.S., including industry, educational institutions,
nonprofit organizations, NASA centers, and other Government agencies.
 
For further information please contact: Dr. Carl Pilcher, Director, 
NASA Astrobiology Institute, Mail Stop 247-6, Ames Research Center,
National Aeronautics and Space Administration, Moffett Field, CA

[NASA] FINAL TEXT AND DUE DATES FOR ASTROBIOLOGY SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY 
FOR EXPLORING PLANETS

This amendment announces a proposal opportunity in Appendix C.20 of
ROSES-2007 entitled "Astrobiology Science and Technology for
Exploring Planets" (ASTEP).

This program element solicits proposals for investigations focused on
exploring the Earth's extreme environments in order to develop a
sound technical and scientific basis to conduct astrobiological
research on other solar system bodies. The ASTEP program is a
science-driven exploration program that is expected to result in new
science and operational/technological capabilities to enable the next
generation of planetary exploration. A unique feature that is central
to the ASTEP program is the use of terrestrial (Earth-based; not
necessarily nonaquatic) field campaigns to further science and
technology and NASA's exploration capabilities.

Notices of Intent to propose are due January 18, 2008, and proposals
are due March 18, 2008.

Table 2 and Table 3 of the Summary of Solicitation for this NRA have
been updated to reflect this change.

On or about December 13, 2007, this Amendment to the NASA Research
Announcement "Research Opportunities in Space and Earth Sciences
(ROSES) 2007" (NNH07ZDA001N) will be posted on the NASA research
opportunity homepage at http://nspires.nasaprs.com/ (select
"Solicitations" then "Open Solicitations" then "NNH07ZDA001N").

Further information about this program element is available from Dr.
John D. Rummel, Planetary Science Division, Science Mission
Directorate, NASA, Washington, DC 20546-0001; Telephone: (202)

[NASA] PROPOSE TO BECOME A MEMBER OF THE VENUS SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
DEFINITION TEAM

To the Planetary Science Community:

NASA recently announced the formation of a Venus Science and
Technology Definition Team (STDT), chaired by Mark Bullock, that will
guide a study of Venus Flagship mission architectures.  I encourage
you to propose to become a member of the STDT. The scientific
motivations for future Venus exploration are described in the VEXAG
(Venus Exploration and Analysis Group) Goals and Objectives:

http://www.lpi.usra.edu/vexag/

and the required technologies are described in Technologies for
Extreme Environment:

http://solarsystem.nasa.gov/multimedia/download-detail.cfm?DL_ID=322_

I urge you to apply for membership on the STDT to ensure that the
Venus Flagship architectures reflect the scientific goals of the
community.  Letters of interest are due no later than December 15,
2007 (12:00 pm EST). Please send a letter of interest with abbreviated
CV and one page on your expertise and possible contribution to the
STDT by email to Adriana Ocampo at NASA HQ (aco@nasa.gov).

[Editor Note: The deadline for this application passed yesterday, 
however if you are still interested, please contact Ellan Stofan at
the address above.]

THE SCIENCE OF SOLAR SYSTEM ICES (ScSSI): A CROSS-DISCIPLINARY 
WORKSHOP

May 5-8, Oxnard, CA

As a response to the growing need for cross-disciplinary dialog 
and communication in the Planetary Ices science community, NASA's Jet 
Propulsion Laboratory and the Lunar and Planetary Institute are 
hosting a workshop entitled: The Science of Solar System Ices (ScSSI): 
A Cross-Disciplinary Workshop. The role of laboratory research and 
simulations in advancing our understanding of solar system ices 
(including satellites, KBOs, comets, and giant planets) is becoming 
increasingly important. Understanding ice surface radiation processing, 
particle and radiation penetration depths, surface and subsurface 
chemistry, morphology, phases, density, conductivity, etc., are only a 
few examples of the inventory of issues that are being addressed by 
Earth-based laboratory research. This workshop aims to achieve direct 
dialog and foster focused collaborations among the observational, 
modeling, and laboratory research communities.  

The deadline for abstract submission is Tuesday, February 19, 2008,
5:00 p.m. CST.

PODCASTS OF TALKS BY NOTED ASTRONOMERS AVAILABLE ON ASP SITE

Audio recordings of ten public lectures by noted astronomers are now
available as free MP3 downloads at the web site of the nonprofit 
Astronomical Society of the Pacific (ASP):

http://www.astrosociety.org/education/podcast/index.html

These talks were recorded at Foothill College in the Silicon Valley 
Astronomy Lecture Series.  They are made available through a kind
donation to the ASP by a donor with a strong interest in education
who wishes to remain anonymous. Each hour-long lecture on some
exciting development in our study of the universe is followed
by an extensive question and answer period, in which the speaker
gives further details and personal glimpses about the topics under
discussion.

A few talks are also available as video files (instructions can be 
found on the same page.) 

[Editor Note: A full list of the available lectures, including 
abstracts, is available via the link above.]
