[NASA] INFORMATIONAL BRIEFING IN SUPPORT OF ISS PAYLOADS FOR THE SMEX 
AO

On Wednesday, December 19, 2007, NASA will provide an informational 
telecon briefing on the International Space Station (ISS) external 
payload accommodation and integration capabilities.  The capabilities 
for installing and operating payloads on the Express Logistics 
Carriers (ELC) mounted on the ISS truss structure, the Japanese 
Experiment Module ("Kibo") Exposed Facility (EF), the European Space 
Agency (ESA) Columbus External Payload Facility (EPF), the U.S. 
Laboratory's Window Research Observation Facility (WORF), and the 
Japanese HII Transfer Vehicle (HTV) (launch vehicle) will be described.

[NASA] HUBBLE SPACE TELESCOPE CYCLE 17 CALL FOR PROPOSALS

Proposal Deadline: March 07, 2008

NASA and The Space Telescope Science Institute (STScI) are pleased to 
announce the Cycle 17 Call for Proposals for Hubble Space Telescope 
(HST) Observations and funding for Archival Research and Theoretical 
Research programs. Participation in this program is open to all 
categories of organizations, both domestic and foreign, including 
educational institutions, profit and nonprofit organizations, NASA 
Centers, and other Government agencies.

This solicitation for proposals will be open through March 07, 2008, 
8:00pm EST. The Astronomer's Proposal Tools (APT), which is required 
for Phase I Proposal Submission will be made available/released for 
Cycle 17 Phase I use during the 2nd week of January 2008. Results of 
the selection will be announced in early June 2008.

All programmatic and technical information, as well as specific 
guidelines for proposal preparation, are available electronically 
from the STScI World-Wide Web site at the Announcement Web Page with 
URL: http://www.stsci.edu/hst/proposing/docs/cycle17announce

In Cycle 17, proposers should assume that HST will operate in 
three-gyro mode. HST has been operating in two-gyro mode since 29
August 2005.

AAAS POLICY ALERT

US Federal Budget News

[Editor note: NASA and other programs are operating on reduced funding
as a consequence of government failure to pass a budget for FY08, which 
began October 1. The following is an update from AAAS.]

Congress remained out of session last week, and there was no progress 
on FY 2008 appropriations. (The Senate has technically been in session
and has been meeting in pro forma session for a few seconds every
three days, a parliamentary tactic to keep the President from making
recess appointments).
  
The current continuing resolution (CR) providing temporary funding at
last year's funding levels for all domestic programs runs out next
Friday (Dec. 14). Both House and Senate resume regular business this
week.

Within the next two weeks, Congress hopes to assemble an omnibus
appropriations bill with $11 billion more for domestic programs than
the President's request, down from the $23 billion extra that
Congress had been hoping to add.

POSSIBLE ONE-DAY EXTENSION OF THE IPEWG MEETING SCHEDULE

Dear colleagues,

Following up the final announcement of the first meeting of the
International Primitive Body Exploration Working Group, we are already
receiving many responses by now.  Thus, we are now investigating a
possibility if we could extend the meeting for one more day, i.e., to
continue until January 16th.

So please plan your travel schedule carefully and let your colleagues
know about this, too.  Even if we eventually need to pack everything
in the original two days, Okinawa still offers great tourist spots
that you can visit and quite easily spend more than one day!

We will update our homepage as soon as such an schedule extension is
decided and we will send emails to all those who have registered by
then. The homepage is as follows:

http://www.jspec.jaxa.jp/okinawa_index.html

In case that your presentation/participation must be done before
January 16th, please kindly let us know upon your registration or
email me.

Thank you very much for your kind attention.  I look forward to meeting
you all in Okinawa.

Sincerely yours,

Hajime YANO

SECOND WORKSHOP ON MARS VALLEY NETWORKS

October 20-24, 2008
Moab, Utah

Focus discussions will include extraction of watershed information
from digital elevation models of the martian surface, age-dating
valley network systems, and other quantitative measurements of valley
networks. A fieldtrip to look at sapping features in the Colorado
Plateau is also planned.

Contact "workshops@si.edu" to receive updates and to pre-register, or

11TH CONFERENCE ON ELECTROMAGNETIC AND LIGHT SCATTERING

The meeting will address theoretical developments and simulations, 
laboratory and field experiments, measurements and applications in
light scattering by particles with emphasis on cosmic dust and
planetary aerosols.

The conference will be held on September 7-12, 2008 at the University 
de Havilland Campus in Hatfield, just 20 miles north of London.
