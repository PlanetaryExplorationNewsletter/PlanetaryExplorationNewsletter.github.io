WE WANT TO INCREASE PEN READERSHIP!

The Planetary Exploration Newsletter is a quick and easy means of
distributing information across the professional planetary science
community. Despite several notices by our participating professional
societies and other groups, many of our colleagues are still unaware of
PEN's existence! Help us improve our communication by downloading the
flier at

http://planetarynews.org/flier_pen.pdf

and posting it at your institution. Thank you!

[NASA] NSPIRES: PROPOSAL OPPORTUNITY: EDUCATION AND PUBLIC OUTREACH 
(E/PO) DIVISION SUPPORT GROUPS

On September 4, 2007, the National Aeronautics and Space 
Administration (NASA) Science Mission Directorate (SMD) is releasing 
a Cooperative Agreement Notice (NNH07ZDA002C) for submission of 
proposals to support the coordination and integration of the 
education and public outreach activities in SMD.  Four awards are 
anticipated, one Division Support Group for each of the four SMD 
Science Divisions: Astrophysics, Earth Science, Heliophysics, and 
Planetary Science.  The support functions include: support the 
integration and coordination of E/PO activities between Science 
Divisions across SMD; support the integration and coordination of all 
mission and non-mission E/PO activities within the respective Science 
Division; support the science community and scientists interested in 
E/PO; support the education communities interested in SMD E/PO 
content; support special requirements within the respective Science 
Division; and provide electronic communication and collaboration. 
Proposals should clearly articulate an approach to these support 
functions that extends the value of SMD investments in E/PO, promotes 
coherence across SMD, and contributes to NASA's education outcomes.

Participation is open to all categories of organizations (domestic 
and non-U.S.), including industry, educational institutions, 
not-for-profit organizations, Federally Funded Research and 
Development Centers, NASA Centers, the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, and 
other Government agencies.  Upon its release date, this Cooperative 
Agreement Notice will be available electronically from

http://nspires.nasaprs.com/ (select "Solicitations" then select "Open
Solicitations" then select "NNH07ZDA002C").

Notices of Intent (NOIs) are due October 2, 2007, and proposals are 
due December 7, 2007.

EARTH & SPACE 2008: INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ENGINEERING, SCIENCE, 
CONSTRUCTION, AND OPERATIONS IN CHALLENGING ENVIRONMENTS

3-5 March 2008

Long Beach, California, USA

Experts from a variety of disciplines will gather to discuss 
exploration, engineering, construction, and operations in challenging 
environments on the Moon, Earth and Mars, in space and on other 
bodies of the inner Solar System.

The 2008 Earth & Space Conference will be the best source for new 
insights and strategies in the Aerospace field. You will find a 
combination of research and applied engineering along with current 
practices in the industry and space-related business.

Symposia of note:
-Exploration and Utilization of Extraterrestrial Bodies 
-Granular Materials in Lunar and Martian Exploration 
-Advance Materials, Structures and Mechanics 
-Ballistic Impact and Crashworthiness Response of Aerospace Structures 
-Intelligent Sensors and Actuators 
-Dynamics and Systems

Abstract deadline: 17 September 2007

AGU: CELEBRATING 40 YEARS IN SAN FRANCISCO!

AGU is celebrating it's 40th consecutive Fall Meeting in San Francisco
this December. A bit of trivia - how many Fall Meetings have you
attended in San Francisco?

The Program Committee has assembled an exciting program this year with
about 550 preplanned sessions.  If you cannot locate a session that
fits your interest, please submit to a General Contributions session in
the appropriate discipline.

The abstract deadline is 6 September at 2359 UT.  Submission guidelines
can be found at:

http://www.agu.org/meetings/fm07/.

Please remember that AGU does not accept late abstract submissions.
Only AGU members in good standing can submit an abstract for the 
meeting.

Consider registering now for the meeting and making your hotel
accommodations. Details can be found at:

http://www.agu.org/meetings/fm07/.

This will be our final reminder to you about the abstract deadline.
Please submit early to avoid the congestion on the deadline date.

AGU ABSTRACT CALL: FOLLOW THE OXIDANTS? CHEMICAL ENERGY FOR PLANETARY 
ENVIRONMENTS AND LIFE (P-13) 

Contributed abstract submissions are solicited for this planetary
science session of the American Geophysical Union meeting in San
Francisco, December 10-14, 2007. This session highlights the abiotic
production and impact of oxidants on chemical evolution, surface and
subsurface conditions, atmospheres, and astrobiological potential of
planetary environments within and beyond the solar system.

Deadline: September 6.

Go to http://www.agu.org/meetings/fm07/

Suggested topics for this session include measurements
and models for space environment inputs to surface and atmospheric
oxidation; observations, laboratory measurements, and theoretical
models for oxidant formation on planetary and extrasolar bodies;
transport of oxidants to, and impact on, subsurface environments
including liquid water and mixed fluid reservoirs and oceans; chemical
interactions and reaction products of oxidants and organics; oxidant
connections to evolution and survival of life; and oxidant effects on
the survival and recognizability of biosignatures. Contributions for
instrument and mission concepts related to oxidant production and
loss, organic interactions, and astrobiological impact are
particularly encouraged. Topics for invited presentations now include
oxidant production measurements in the laboratory and models for
effects on Snowball Earth, Mars, and icy bodies of the outer solar
system.

AGU ABSTRACT CALL: LABORATORY INVESTIGATIONS INTO THE COMPOSITIONS OF 
SOLID SURFACES FROM THE ASTEROID BELT TO THE OORT CLOUD

We would like to encourage submission of abstracts on any topic 
involving laboratory research related to outer solar system solid body
composition to the Planetary Session P14, described below, at the Fall
AGU meeting in San Francisco, December 10-14, 2007.

See details of the meeting at: 

http://www.agu.org/meetings/fm07/

The abstract submission deadline is 6 September 2007, 2359 UT.

Session Description:   The compositions of surfaces in the outer solar
system can be influenced by many processes including internal geologic
activity, impact cratering, solar, cosmic, and magnetospheric 
radiation, and micrometeoroid bombardment. This session solicits an 
intentionally wide range of laboratory investigations related to 
understanding the compositions of solid surfaces in the outer solar 
system in part to foster greater communications between diverse areas
of research. This session is particularly interested in exploring the
general physical and chemical processes that help explain phenomena 
observed in telescopic and spacecraft measurements.

Conveners: Karl Hibbitts (APL-Johns Hopkins University;
Karl.hibbitts@jhuapl.edu), and Thom Orlando (Georgia Institute of
Technology, thomas.orlando@chemistry.gatech.edu).
