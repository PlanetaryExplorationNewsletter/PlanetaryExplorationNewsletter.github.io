SPECIAL: FROM JAMES GREEN, PLANETARY SCIENCE DIVISION DIRECTOR, NASA HQ

I want to draw your attention to an extremely exciting opportunity 
that we are developing for you. SMD is considering issuing a NASA 
Research Announcement (NRA) soliciting annually Mission of 
Opportunity proposals that is not tied to a specific AO. From my 
perspective, this is an important new step forward to better serve 
the planetary science community and get more science done for NASA's 
money that can only succeed with your input. A more detailed 
description of this opportunity can be found at:

init&solId={F1C69583-3A23-8049-FCB7-FE3377ADB200}&path=init

I encourage you to go read and respond to the announcement as it 
applies. To comply with this request you must submit your response in 
the form of an NOI at the NSPIRES website (http://nspires.nasaprs.com/)
under the announcement titled: "Request for Information: Science 
Mission Partnership Opportunities" before the deadline. Your inputs to 
this request for information (RFI) are due on September 26, 2007.
