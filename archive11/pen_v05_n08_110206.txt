THE MOON: THE FIRST BILLION YEARS OF CRUSTAL EVOLUTION

The Woodlands Waterway Marriot, The Woodlands, Texas
March 5-6, 2011
Sponsored by: Brown University, The Vernadsky Institute, 
Brown/MIT NLSI.

The goal of Microsymposium 52 is to present a summary of new 
discoveries, and to bring together representatives of the lunar 
geology, mineralogy, petrology, spectroscopy, geochemistry and 
geophysics communities to ponder the implications of these new 
findings for the next generation of significant scientific problems.  
A critical aspect of this discussion will be to assess the implications 
of this new perspective for future modes and destinations for robotic 
exploration of the Moon.

CALL FOR SYMPOSIUM PAPERS: CHEMISTRY AS A TOOL FOR SPACE EXPLORATION 
AND DISCOVERY AT MARS

August 28-September 1, 2011 
Denver, Colorado
At the Fall 2011 American Chemical Society National Meeting

Mars is the most accessible location outside of the Earth to 
investigate for evidence of past and present habitable zones and for 
extinct or extant extraterrestrial life.  Chemistry-based approaches 
provide the central tool in these exploration efforts. This search 
involves the interplay of physical, organic, inorganic, analytical, 
biological, and geochemistry along with inputs from atmospheric 
physics and remote imaging. NASA and ESA missions, some joint, will 
launch over the next 10 years and carry chemistry-based 
instrumentation to examine whether evidence of past/present 
habitability and habitation exists and where on Mars future 
exploration should be directed. 

Submit abstracts by March 21 to:

http://abstracts.acs.org 

You need to register for an ACS user name and password, log in, select 
242nd National Meeting, create new abstract (if first time), then 
"Chemistry as a Tool for Space Exploration and Discovery at Mars" under 
"CASW". 

Contributed papers may be in the form of oral talks or posters.

Symposium is co-sponsored by the NASA Astrobiology Institute.

[NASA] EARTH AND SPACE SCIENCE FELLOWSHIP (NESSF) PROGRAM 2011/2012
ACADEMIC YEAR PROPOSAL SUBMISSION DEADLINE IS EXTENDED TO FEBRUARY 8

Due to the severe winter weather conditions experienced in large parts 
of the country and the resultant power outages and other hardship 
conditions, the proposal submission deadline for the subject program 
is being extended to February 8, 2011. 

This change will allow additional proposal preparation time for 
proposers who may have been impacted by these conditions, so that all 
proposers may prepare high-quality, responsive proposals.

VENUS LUNCH-TIME TOWN-HALL MEETING AT LPSC, THURSDAY, MARCH 10, 2011

You're invited to participate in a Venus Town-Hall Meeting at LPSC on 
Thursday, March 10, 2011 between Noon and 1:00 p.m. in the Montgomery 
Ballroom, Woodlands Waterway Marriott Hotel and Convention Center, 
Woodlands, Texas.

This will provide for an update on Venus related inputs to the 
Planetary Sciences Decadal Survey, status of the current Venus 
missions and upcoming events.  Discussion topics will be Increasing 
Student Participation in Venus Explorations as well the Exploration 
of Venus in theNext Decade.

The next VEXAG sponsored Science Conference and VEXAG Meeting is 
tentatively scheduled for Monday through Thursday, August 29 - 
September 1, 2011 on the East Coast.  Details will be available soon
