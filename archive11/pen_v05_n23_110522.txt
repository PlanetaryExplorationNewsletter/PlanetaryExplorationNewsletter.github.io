ELISABETTA (BETTY) PIERAZZO, 1963-2011

Betty Pierazzo, Senior Scientist at the Planetary Science Institute,
died on Sunday, May 15, at her home in Tucson, Arizona. She was 47.
Betty was an expert in the area of impact modeling throughout the solar
system as well as an expert on the astrobiological and environmental 
effects of impacts on Earth and Mars. She had a passion for teaching
and was a driving force in the development and expansion of PSI's 
education and public outreach program. Betty approached both life 
and work with enthusiasm and joy and was an inspiring colleague, 
teacher, mentor, and staunch friend. Memorial sites have been posted

SOLICITING ABSTRACTS FOR GSA PLANETARY GEOLOGY DIVISION-SPONSORED 
SESSIONS

2011 Geological Society of America Annual Meeting

Abstract Submission Deadline: Tuesday, July 26, 2011

The 2011 Annual Meeting of the Geological Society of America will be

GSA-PGD G.K. GILBERT SESSION HONORING DR. STEVE SQUYRES

The Planetary Geology Division of the Geological Society of America 
will hold its annual G.K. Gilbert Award Session at the GSA Annual 
Meeting in Minneapolis, October 9-12, 2011, as part of its 30th 
Anniversary Celebration. This year's honoree is Dr. Steve Squyres, 
Professor, Cornell University.  We are soliciting abstracts for the 
Gilbert session from colleagues and former students/postdocs of 
Dr. Squyres.

The G. K. Gilbert Award is presented annually by the Planetary Geology 
Division of the Geological Society of America for outstanding 
contributions to the solution of fundamental problems in planetary 
geology in the broadest sense, which includes geochemistry, mineralogy, 
petrology, geophysics, geologic mapping, and remote sensing. Such 
contributions may consist either of a single outstanding publication 
or a series of publications that have had great influence in the field. 
The award is named for the pioneering geologist G. K. Gilbert.  The 
topic of this year's Gilbert session is "Robotic Exploration of 
Planetary Surfaces".

To submit an abstract please go to:

http://gsa.confex.com/gsa/2011AM/top/index.epl

and select "213. Robotic Exploration of Planetary Surfaces: The 
G.K. Gilbert Award Session".  You will be taken to the abstract 
submittal page.

EPSC-DPS SESSION: SB11. SOLAR SYSTEM SCIENCE FROM WISE

We would like to invite all interested researchers to contribute
abstracts to the "Solar System Science from WISE" session of the
European Planetary Science Congress and Division of Planetary Sciences
(EPSC-DPS) Joint Meeting 2011 to be held in Nantes, France, October
3rd-7th, 2011.  This session is part of the "Small Bodies" program
group.  With the recent public release of WISE data covering half of
the inertial sky, a new era of thermal infrared study of small bodies
has begun.  This data set contains observations of everything from
NEOs to Centaurs and beyond, while the full catalog includes nearly
two orders of magnitude more objects than its predecessor, IRAS.

The abstract deadline is May 31, 2011, and more information as well as
the abstract submission tool can be found at the website:

http://meetings.copernicus.org/epsc-dps2011/home.html

We encourage you to pass this message on to any interested colleagues
and students.

Conveners: A. Mainzer and J. Masiero

EPSC-DPS SESSION: GP8-MG9. MOON-MAGNETOPSHERE INTERACTIONS AT JUPITER 
AND SATURN

Please consider submitting an abstract to this interdisciplinary 
session! Abstracts are due May 31.

New data and data analyses, modeling capabilities, and theories have 
improved our understanding of satellite-magnetosphere interactions in 
recent years.  It is a good time to take stock of the current state of 
knowledge.  This session invites presentations that deal with all 
aspects of the influences of active and inert satellites on the 
magnetospheres of Jupiter and Saturn, as well as the effects of the 
magnetospheres on the moons themselves. Topics can include, for 
instance, consequences to the plasma flow near the body, the generation 
of current systems, mass loading and microsignatures.  We also welcome 
talks focused on modifications of satellite surfaces by magnetospheric 
weathering processes.  For example, the generation of atmospheres and 
extended or even circumplanetary tori would be appropriate.  Comparisons 
between the satellite-magnetosphere interactions in the two systems will 
be given priority.  

Co-Conveners: Chris Paranicas & Amanda Hendrix

[NASA] NEW PROPOSAL OPPORTUNITUES FOR EARCH AND SPACE SCIENCE 
EXPERIMENTS USING SHORT DURATION ORBITAL PLATFORMS INCLUDING CUBESATS

Short duration orbital platforms, such as CubeSats, may offer new 
capabilities for the conduct of NASA scientific research, education, 
and technology advancement. NASA has commenced a CubeSat Launch 
Initiative and begun regularly providing launch opportunities for 
CubeSats as secondary payloads on NASA launch vehicles. 

Generally speaking, proposals for investigations that are carried out 
through development, launch, and operation of a short duration orbital 
experiment are permitted in any ROSES program element that solicits 
investigations for use on suborbital platforms, including aircraft, 
sounding rockets, and scientific balloons. In this sense, a 
CubeSat-based investigation is a "suborbital class" investigation even 
though it will generally be placed into orbit, and it is subject to the 
same cost and risk tolerance constraints to which traditional 
suborbital investigations are subject. Go to:

http://nspires.nasaprs.com/ 

select "Solicitations" then "Open Solicitations" then "NNH11ZDA001N".

Questions concerning programs through which short duration orbital 
platforms are solicited may be addressed to the NASA POC identified at 
end of each program element appendix. General questions concerning the 
solicitation for experiments on short duration orbital platforms may 
be addressed to

JOURNALIST REQUESTS INPUT FROM LATEST DISCOVERY PROPOSERS

From: David Mosher (dave@davemosher.com)

I'm a science journalist working on a fun and informative story for a 
popular science publication about the category I, II, III and IV 
mission proposals submitted to NASA's 2010 Discovery Program. 
Unfortunately, there is no public access to these detailed and finely 
crafted proposals.

If you were involved in any of the 28 submissions -- especially 
category IV "nonselected" proposals -- I'd love to chat with you as 
soon as possible. I'm interested in gathering basic mission 
descriptions and images (conceptual illustrations, engineering 
diagrams, etc.) to properly showcase each of the ideas.

About me: I'm a Wired.com contributor who has worked for 
Discovery.com, Space.com and Discover Magazine in the past. My most 
recent freelance clients include Scientific American/Nature, National 
Geographic News, Science, and more. 

Thank you.

UPCOMING DEADLINE - LUNGRADCON 2011

If you've already submitted an abstract for the NASA Lunar Science 
Forum, it's not to late to do so for LunGradCon 2011, too! The 2nd 
Annual Lunar Graduate Conference (LunGradCon 2011) will be held on 
Sunday, July 17, 2011 at the NASA Ames Research Center (ARC), prior to 
the NASA Lunar Science Forum. LunGradCon provides an opportunity for 
grad students and early-career postdocs to present their research on 
lunar science in a low-stress, constructive, friendly environment of 
their peers. In addition gaining experience with oral presentations, 
the conference presents opportunities for networking with fellow grad 
students, postdocs, and senior members of the NASA Lunar Science 
Institute. A limited amount of funding (~$400) will be provided for 
travel and lodging costs. The astract submission deadline is May 31, 
2011.
