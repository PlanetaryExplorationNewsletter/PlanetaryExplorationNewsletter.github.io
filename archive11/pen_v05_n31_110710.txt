THE WHITE HOUSE IS SOLICITING COMMENTS FOR REVISIONS TO THE OMB 
CIRCULAR A-21

The White House is soliciting comments for revisions to Office of 
Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-21, the document that defines 
how grantees may spend grant money and how it must be handled and 
reported by their host institutions.  One might expect parallel 
changes in the parallel documents covering different types of grantee 
institutions.  The goal is to reduce the burdens of managing and 
spending Federal grants, and it applies to grants from all agencies.  

Comments are due 28 July.  Please see:

GSA ANNUAL MEETING 2011 SESSION T214: EXPLORING BY SPACECRAFT - 
FIRST MESSENGER RESULTS FROM ORBIT

We invite abstracts for the following topical session, co-sponsored by 
the GSA Planetary Geology Division, GSA Geophysics Division, GSA 
Mineralogy, Geochemistry, Petrology, and Volcanology Division, and the 
GSA Structural Geology and Tectonics Division

After three successful flybys of Mercury, NASA's MESSENGER (MErcury 
Surface, Space ENvironment, GEochemistry, and Ranging) spacecraft 
entered orbit about the innermost planet in March 2011.  The orbital 
phase of the mission will enable the first global perspective on the 
planet's geology, surface composition, topography, and gravity and 
magnetic fields.  The first six months of MESSENGER's year-long mission 
corresponds to one solar day on Mercury, so the entire surface will 
have been viewed in sunlight during that period.  This session will 
highlight the latest results on Mercury's volcanic, tectonic, and 
impact cratering history.

Conveners: 
Sean C. Solomon, Carnegie Institution of Washington 
Louise M. Prockter, Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory
David T. Blewett, Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory

The GSA Annual meeting will be held in Minneapolis from October 9-12, 
2011.

Abstract deadline: July 26, 2011

AGU FALL 2011 SESSION:  P28. PLASMA INTERACTIONS WITH AIRLESS BODIES

Conveners:  Jasper Halekas, Zoltan Sternovsky, Xu Wang, Matt Fillingim

We invite contributions on plasma interactions with airless bodies,
including linkages to surfaces, magnetic fields, exospheres, impact
processes, dust dynamics, and dusty plasmas. These universal processes
operate at the Moon, Mercury, moons of Mars and outer planets, and
small bodies.  Recent years have seen new observations from an
international fleet of lunar probes, Mars Express, Earth-based assets,
etc.  The Lunar Science Institute (NLSI) and others have led
corresponding advances in laboratory experiments, theory, and
modeling.  In the coming years, we expect more exciting new data from
ARTEMIS, MESSENGER, LADEE, etc.  This session is open to observational,
theoretical, and laboratory topics, including comparative and
predictive studies.

Invited Speakers: Vassilis Angelopoulos, Geraint Jones, Mihaly

AGU FALL 2011 SESSION:  P29. POLARIMETRY AS AN INVALUABLE TOOL TO STUDY 
THE SOLAR SYSTEM AND BEYOND

Dear Colleagues, 
We kindly invite you to submit an abstract to the session  P29: 
"Polarimetry as an Invaluable Tool to Study the Solar System and 
Beyond" of AGU Fall Meeting 2011, which will take  place in 
San Francisco, CA, 5-8 December.

Abstracts are due 04 August 2011.

Polarimetry is a powerful tool providing a wealth of information  about 
astronomical objects that cannot be obtained by traditional  
photometric/spectroscopic observations.  In the solar system 
polarimetry has been widely used e.g. to characterize the surface  of 
atmosphereless bodies and in solar physics to explore the  magnetism of 
the solar atmosphere.

This session is open to papers about recent spectropolarimetric
observations of solar system bodies (including comets), theoretical or 
experimental investigations and instrumental developments for  
spectropolarimeters to be included in ground-based facilities or 
onboard future space missions.  Presentations about polarimetry of 
exoplanets and circumstellar envelopes are also welcome.  

More information:   Session P29 "Polarimetry as an Invaluable Tool to 
Study the Solar System and Beyond"

AGU FALL 2011 SESSION:  P30. PREPARING FOR THE SCIENCE OF MARS SAMPLE 
RETURN

We would like to draw your attention to a Fall AGU session on 
"Preparing for the Science of Mars Sample Return."  We encourage you 
to see this as an opportunity to contribute to a discussion on what we 
hope to learn when Mars samples are returned to Earth.  We welcome 
submissions from a range of disciplines with a friendly reminder that 
submissions this year are due on August 4, 2011.
 
Returned samples may unlock wide-ranging questions about the geology, 
surface processes, and habitability of Mars that cannot be answered by 
study of meteorites or current mission data.  The 2013-2022 NRC Decadal 
Survey has thus named its #1 Flagship priority as MAX-C, the first of 
a three-mission, multi-decadal effort to return samples from Mars. 
Continued support by the scientific community will be critical to the 
campaign's success.  This session will highlight the large-scale 
implications of existing datasets with an eye toward what may be 
learned when samples are returned.  Topics will span planetary science 
including high- and low-T geochemistry, igneous and sedimentary 
petrology, mineral spectroscopy, and astrobiology.

AGU FALL 2011 SESSION:  P32. SCIENCE ENABLED BY THE NASA LUNAR SCIENCE
INSTITUTE (NLSI) - PROGRESS AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS

We are soliciting contributed submissions on all aspects of lunar 
science, including, but not limited to, research enabled by the NASA 
Lunar Science Institute (NLSI). The past three years have witnessed a 
renaissance in lunar science, demonstrated by five major lunar 
missions, the establishment of NLSI and a growing NextGen community.  
We seek presentations on topics ranging from geology/geochemistry, 
impact cratering, lunar formation and solar system dynamics, space 
plasma/exosphere and surface interactions, volatile characterization as 
well as the unique astronomy enabled by the radio-quiet far side of the 
Moon.

AGU FALL 2011 SESSION:  P33. TITAN - AN EARTH-LIKE WORLD
 
Description: Titan is a unique satellite in the solar system because 
of its substantial atmosphere, resulting in surface-atmospheric 
interactions similar to those on Earth.  As the timescale of 
observations has increased, seasonal changes have been observed, 
including shifts in weather patterns and surface changes probably due 
to rainfall and evaporation or infiltration.  This session will focus 
on the latest Cassini and ground-based results regarding Titan and the 
interactions between its different systems (atmosphere, surface, 
interior, etc.).  Theoretical and modeling results explaining recent 
observations are also encouraged.
 
Abstract deadline is August 4.

AGU FALL 2011 SESSION:  P36. VOLCANISM ASSOCIATED WITH IMPACT BASINS 
IN THE SOLAR SYSTEM

Please consider submitting an abstract to Session P36: Volcanism 
Associated with Impact Basins in the Solar System.

Impact basins are often associated with volcanism, both in their 
interiors and, as increasingly recognized, on their margins.  This 
session will explore aspects of melt generation, ascent, intrusion, 
and eruption, to explain the observed geology, petrology, and 
geophysics of volcanic units and their basin settings.  Key questions 
include "To what extent does the impact process influence the subsequent 
regional magmatic history?" and "What accounts for observed timing 
offsets between impact and volcanism?"  Insights from sample analysis 
and remote sensing, including imaging, spectroscopy, topography, and 
gravity data are solicited.  Results exploiting new datasets from 
ongoing missions to the Moon and Mercury are particularly welcome.

Sponsor: Planetary Sciences (P). Co-Sponsor: Volcanology, Geochemistry, 
and Petrology (V).

AGU FALL 2011 SESSION:  C11. EARTH AND PLANETARY CATASTROPHIC ICE-FLUID 
INTERACTIONS

Dear colleagues,

We would like to draw your attention to the following session at the 
AGU Fall Meeting 2011 in San Francisco, California, USA (December 
5th-9th, 2011).  Abstract submission is now open at:

http://agu-fm11.abstractcentral.com/

and the deadline for submissions is 4 August 23:59 EDT/03:59 +1 GMT.

C11: Earth and Planetary Catastrophic Ice-Fluid Interactions

Conveners: Jason Amundson, Dorian Abbot, Britney Schmidt, and Wendy 
Zhang

This session explores possible connections between mechanical failure 
in disordered particulate systems and catastrophic ice-fluid 
interactions, which occur during the break-up of river and sea ice, in 
ice-melange-filled fjords, ice shelf collapse, and possibly, the 
formation of the chaos terrains on Europa.  Whenever glaciological 
flows involve rapid acceleration, the mechanical resistance can be 
dominated by contribution from the surface debris layer, and can be 
modeled as a two-dimensional assembly of densely-packed particles.  In 
ice collapse and disruption events, fluid-ice interactions can produce 
debris, such as chaos terrain matrix. We invite contributions that 
examine both idealized systems and examples from nature.
