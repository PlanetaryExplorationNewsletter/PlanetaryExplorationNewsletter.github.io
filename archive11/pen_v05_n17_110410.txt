CURRENT STATUS OF ACM 2011

Dear all who are interested in ACM 2011,

Due to the recent earthquake and tsunami disaster in Japan, and its 
consequences, the local and scientific organizing committee of ACM 2011 
have decided to postpone the meeting, until the situation in Japan is 
stabilized.

The committees are now discussing the new schedule. We are currently 
keeping our intention to hold the meeting in the original place, 
Niigata in Japan. We are trying to avoid conflicts with other meetings 
and major university events.

Our decision will be announced to the community as soon as possible.

We are currently closing abstract submission (at the LPI site), 
registration, and travel grant submission.

As we expect that the meeting will be postponed for several months or 
perhaps one year, the submitted abstracts and registrations will be 
discarded. We will open new forms for submission and registration after 
the schedule is fixed.

We apologize for any inconvenience this may cause, and hope you will
be contributing in the future to the ACM meeting.

If you have any questions or comments, please contact:

ACM2011@pub.mtk.nao.ac.jp

Best Regards,
Sho Sasaki,
Chair of Scientific Organizing Committee, ACM 2011

Jun-ich Watanabe
Chair of Local Organizing Committee, ACM 2011

TENURE-TRACK POSITIONS AT BROWN IN EARLY PLANETARY PROCESSES AND 
CLIMATE MODELING

Dear Colleagues:

As you may know, Brown University has recently been implementing a 
"Plan for Academic Enrichment" designed to build research and teaching 
capabilities in new areas and broaden and deepen areas of existing 
strength.  As part of this undertaking, the Department of Geological 
Sciences is currently in the midst of searches for two new tenure-track 
faculty appointments, one in Early Planetary Processes and another in 
Climate Modeling, as we look to deepen and broaden the base of our 
existing program. 

In addition, we are announcing a new opening in the area of Remote 
Compositional Analysis.

Would you please take a moment to advise me of potential candidates 
in this area and to also post and distribute this announcement in 
your department and to potentially interested colleagues? 

Thanks in advance for your advice and assistance. 

Best Regards, 

Jim Head

TENURE-TRACK FACULTY APPOINTMENT AT BROWN: PLANETARY REMOTE 
COMPOSITIONAL ANALYSIS

The Department of Geological Sciences at Brown University 
(http://www.geo.brown.edu/) invites applications for a tenure-track 
faculty appointment in Planetary Remote Compositional Analysis. The 
emphasis of this position is on the application of experimental and 
quantitative analytical approaches to the characterization, analysis 
and understanding of remotely sensed spectroscopic data to address 
critical problems in planetary sciences.  Such problems might include 
the composition of materials comprising planetary bodies, the physical 
and chemical weathering of surfaces, and the nature of planetary 
processes. Analysis of field data and spacecraft data in addressing 
such problems is also strongly encouraged. 

Candidates should complement our current planetary science strengths 
in planetary evolution, volcanism, impact cratering, climate history, 
and remote sensing, as well as departmental focus areas of Earth 
system history, solid Earth dynamics, and Earth and planetary materials 
and processes. The successful candidate will maintain an active, 
externally funded research program and enjoy a commitment to teaching 
at both undergraduate and graduate levels. Appointment is expected at 
the Assistant Professor level, although exceptional circumstances 
could warrant appointment as Associate Professor.

EPSC-DPS CONFERENCE SESSION - ASTEROIDS AND NEAS

We would like to invite all colleagues interested in the research on 
Asteroids and Near-Earth Asteroids to participate in the following 
session at the European  Planetary Science Congress (EPSC-DPS Joint 
Meeting 2011) to be held in Nantes, France, 03-07 October 2011:

Small Bodies Session 4: Asteroids and NEAs

The session will focus on the interrelation between the different 
populations of asteroids (main belt, Trojans) and near-Earth objects, 
with implications on their origin and physical properties. These 
interrelationships may be revealed through observational surveys 
(discovery and characterization) as well as through numerical modeling 
and/or experiments of physical processes (impacts, thermal effects, 
spin up/down and related shape changes and mass loss, etc...) that 
these bodies undergo during their evolution. 

For general information on the conference and online abstract
submission (deadline May 31, 2011), please visit the web site:

[NASA] FINAL TEXT FOR THE MARS FUNDAMENTAL RESEARCH PROGRAM AO

The Mars Fundamental Research Program (MFRP) seeks to sponsor the best 
and most innovative scientific research concerning atmospheric, 
climatological, geologic, geophysical, and geochemical processes on 
Mars. The program offers opportunities for Mars research beyond those 
available from analyses of spacecraft data alone. 

The major change to the text is the explicit incorporation of reference 
to the recent planetary decadal survey. The due date for MFRP Notices 
of Intent and proposals remain unchanged at May 6 and July 8, 2011, 
respectively. 

Go to:

http://nspires.nasaprs.com/ 

select "Solicitations" then "Open Solicitations" then "NNH11ZDA001N".

[NASA] ASTROBIOLOGY SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY FOR INSTRUMENT DEVELOPMENT 
(ASTID)

The ASTID program element requests proposals to develop 
instrumentation capabilities to help meet Astrobiology science 
requirements on future space flight missions, as well as unique 
Astrobiology science objectives on Earth. Selected activities are 
expected to advance the development of scientific instruments or 
instrument components to the point where the instruments could credibly 
be proposed in response to future flight opportunity announcements, 
including instruments that could be accommodated on or in small 
satellites (under 50kg total spacecraft mass), or as small payloads in 
support of future science activities associated with missions of human 
exploration. 

Development of instruments for use in future field campaigns is 
solicited under the Astrobiology Science and Technology for Exploring 
Planets (ASTEP) program.

Proposals to ASTID and the Planetary Instrument Definition and 
Development Program will be reviewed together and thus, if identical 
proposals are submitted to both programs, only one will be reviewed.

[NASA] CHANGE OF SCOPE, NAME AND DUE DATES FOR CASSINI DATA ANALYSIS 
AND PARTICIPATING SCIENTISTS (CDAPS) PROGRAM

The Cassini Participating Scientist Program has been added to the ROSES 
call and merged with the Cassini Data Analysis Program to form a new 
program element called the Cassini Data Analysis and Participating 
Scientists (CDAPS) Program. 

The due date for notices of intent (NOIs) has been delayed to Friday, 
June 10, 2011.

The due date for proposals has been delayed to Friday, July 8, 2011.

The objective of the Cassini Data Analysis and Participating Scientists 
Program (CDAPS) is to enhance the scientific return of the Cassini 
mission by broadening the scientific participation in the analysis and 
interpretation of the data returned by the mission. A subset of CDAPS 
selectees will also serve as Participating Scientists, which will 
further broaden participating in the mission by augmenting the existing 
science team. This program solicits research proposals to conduct 
scientific investigations utilizing data obtained by the Cassini and 
Huygens spacecraft.
