EDITORIAL: JWST THREATENS PLANETARY SCIENCE

The recently released NRC Planetary Decadal Survey ("Visions and 
Voyages"), with input from the planetary community, detailed specific 
priorities for the next decade of solar system exploration. This 
carefully laid out plan is under threat from cost overruns by the 
NASA James Webb Space Telescope. The NRC Planetary Decadal Survey did 
not cite JWST as a priority for planetary science.

JWST has, however, been a priority in the NRC Astrophysics Decadal 
Surveys. When JWST was ranked as the top major initiative for NASA 
astrophysics in the 2001 NRC Astronomy Decadal Survey, it was estimated 
to cost $1B and launch by 2011. NASA has now spent $3.5B on JWST and it 
is now projected to cost a minimum of $8.7B for a launch no earlier 
than late 2018. As a result, JWST's cost increases have outstripped the 
resources of the NASA Science Mission Directorate's Astrophysics 
Division, and NASA leadership has now declared JWST an "agency 
priority." Resources of other NASA programs, including the Agency's 
Planetary Sciences Division within the Science Mission Directorate, 
are now threatened to cover current and future JWST cost overruns. 

Citing these overruns, the House zeroed out JWST from NASA's 2012 
budget. 

We believe it is time to have an open debate on JWST and its value 
across all targeted communities, from planetary, Earth science, and 
heliophysics to human spaceflight. Congress needs to be informed about 
the impact of the choices facing it. 

We individually and together reject the premise that JWST must be 
restored at all costs. We further stand by the following positions:

(1) There are important national priorities in space beyond the goals 
    of JWST that as a country we cannot afford to sacrifice.
(2) If Congress believes JWST is so important that it must be restored, 
    then Congress should commit to adding funds to the NASA budget 
    sufficient to cover JWST's expenses from here forward, recognizing 
    that it may well cost more than $8.7B. 
(3) Without additional funds to NASA, JWST should not be restored 
    unless and until an open science community assessment is made of 
    the value of what will be gained and what will be lost across the 
    entire NASA science portfolio.
(4) If Congress cancels JWST, it is important to preserve the NASA 
    astrophysics budget and mandate the formulation of a plan to retain 
    US astrophysics leadership.
