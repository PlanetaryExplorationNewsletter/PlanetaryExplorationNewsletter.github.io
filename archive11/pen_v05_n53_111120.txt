POSTDOCTORAL POSITION AVAILABLE - WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY

The Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences at Washington 
University in Saint Louis invites applications for their new Steve 
Fossett Postdoctoral Fellowship.  The Department seeks outstanding 
candidates who will strengthen and complement existing areas of study,
including both terrestrial and planetary geology, geochemistry, and 
geophysics.  Candidates will be encouraged to collaborate directly 
with faculty and students within the department, and will be invited
to lead a seminar in their area of expertise.  Ideal candidates will
have trans-disciplinary interests, and will interact scientifically 
with a broad spectrum of the department's members.  This competitive 
postdoc is awarded for a one-year period, which may be extended to 
a second year.  Applicants should contact a potential faculty sponsor 
to discuss additional arrangements.  Applications will be considered 
until the position is filled, but priority will be given to those 
received before January 15, 2012.  For further information:

"COSMOS IN THE CLASSROOM 2010" PROCEEDINGS BEING PUBLISHED IN CD FORMAT

The Astronomical Society of the Pacific announces the publication of 
the papers, handouts, and resources from the national conference on 
teaching introductory astronomy held last summer at the University of 
Colorado. The 350-page proceedings include 80 contributions from
more than 100 authors (including many of the key leaders in astronomy 
teaching and education research).

Edited by Andrew Fraknoi, the volume is being published as a handy CD, 
which allows you to view and print any or all of the sections as you 
need them. The materials included will be of help to both novice and 
veteran instructors seeking to improve or vary their teaching 
techniques. 

For the full table of contents, see:

http://www.astrosociety.org/cosmos/

The regular cost of the proceedings will be $24.95 plus
shipping and handling.  You can, however, order it during the initial 
publication period for the discounted price of $19.95 (plus shipping 
& handling), if you order before Jan. 31, 2012.

To order through the Society's on-line AstroShop, go to:

NASA POSTDOCTORAL FELLOWSHIPS

The NASA Postdoctoral Program (NPP) offers scientists and engineers 
unique opportunities to conduct research at NASA Centers. Each NPP 
fellowship opportunity is designed to advance NASA research in a 
specific project related to space science, earth science, aeronautics,
space operations, exploration systems, lunar science, or astrobiology.

Applicants must have a Ph.D. or equivalent degree in hand before 
beginning the fellowship, but may apply while completing the degree 
requirements. U. S. citizens, Lawful Permanent Residents, and foreign 
nationals eligible for J-1 status as a Research Scholar may apply.  
An H-1B Visa status is not acceptable because the NPP is not an 
employment program.

Stipends for Postdoctoral Fellows start at $50,000 per year, with 
moderate supplements for high cost-of-living areas and for certain 
academic specialties. Funds are available for relocation expenses, 
up to a specified limit, and health insurance is available through 
the program. Fellows also receive $8,000 per appointment year to 
support travel to conferences, meetings, and other activities that 
directly support their research.

Applications are accepted three times each year: March 1, July 1, 
and November 1.

[NASA] LETTER FROM SARA: RFIS ON ACCESS TO RESULTS OF FEDERALLY FUNDED 
RESEARCH

Dear Colleagues,
 
This is the letter from SARA, a short update for NASA scientists. 
The White House Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) 
recently released two requests for information about increasing public 
access to results of federally funded research, specifically, 
peer-reviewed publications and digital data resulting from federally 
funded scientific research. The idea is that OSTP is trying to assess 
what information should be accessible to the public, when, and how. 
For example, peer reviewed publications from NIH funding are available 
to the public in manuscript format a year after publication (via PMC) 

http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/about/public-access-info/

with links back to the official journal version. There is no such 
public electronic library for NASA (or any other Agency). Thus, access 
to articles depends on the publisher. Articles published in some 
journals become available after a year, even to those who don't have
subscriptions. Those in some other journals never become available 
without subscriptions. Since publishing papers and generating data 
are the major tangible products of the grants given by SMD we want
to encourage our grantees to know about and respond to these RFIs.

planetary bodies. Terrestrial studies (either in the field or 
laboratory) aimed at understanding other planetary bodies are also 
encouraged.

Please note there is an Abstract Processing Charge of 40 euros per 
abstract.

Students: Please note that there is an earlier abstract deadline

[NASA] LIVING WITH A STAR TARGETED RESEARCH AND TECHNOLOGY NASA/NSF 
PARTNERSHIP FOR COLLABORATIVE SPACE WEATHER MODELING

A primary goal of NASA's Living With a Star Targeted Research and 
Technology (LWS TRT) program is the development of first-principles-
based models for the coupled Sun-Earth and Sun-Solar System. Such 
models can act as tools for science investigations, as prototypes 
and test beds for prediction and specification capabilities, as 
frameworks for linking disparate data sets at vantage points 
throughout the Sun-Solar System, and as strategic planning aids 
for enabling exploration of outer space and testing new mission 
concepts.

Title: Living With a Star Targeted Research and Technology NASA/NSF 
   Partnership For Collaborative Space Weather Modeling
