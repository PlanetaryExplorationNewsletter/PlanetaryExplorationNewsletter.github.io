COLD TEMPERATURE TECHNOLOGY APPLICATIONS FOR EXPLORING THE LUNAR 
SURFACE AND SEARCHING FOR VOLATILES

This cross-disciplinary workshop, to be held just prior to the Lunar 
and Planetary Science Conference and open to a broad cross-section 
of scientists, technology implementers and developers, will describe 
the nature of breakthroughs in the development of Low Temperature 
Technologies that could support operation below 100 K and are thus 
essential for exploration of the lunar (and other planetary) surfaces, 
particularly polar or permanently shadowed regions where prevailing 
cryogenic conditions would allow entrapment and thus characterization 
and collection of volatiles. Technologies include High Temperature 
Superconductors for Materials and Mechanisms, Ultra Low temperature 
Ultra Low Power Electronics and Cold Temperature Power System 
Components. Advanced concepts for instrument packages and missions 
requiring cold temperature operation will be discussed.

PDS MOON MINERALOGY MAPPER (M3) DATA RELEASE #2

The Planetary Data System (PDS) announces the availability of the Moon 
Mineralogy Mapper (M3) Data Release #2, an instrument on the ISRO 
Chandrayaan-1 Lunar Orbiter (CH-1).  This release includes raw and 
reduced image data (Level 0 and Level 1B) from Optical Period 2 
(20090415 through 20090816).  These data are made available through
the PDS Imaging Node website at URL: 

http://img.pds.nasa.gov/

Data search and access tools are also available at the PDS Geosciences 
Node's Lunar Orbital Data Explorer, URL:

http://ode.rsl.wustl.edu/moon/

Both Nodes have also posted user guides and tutorials to assist users 
in working with M3 data, URLs:

9TH IAA LOW COST PLANETARY MISSIONS CONFERENCE

June 21-24, 2011; Hosted at the Johns Hopkins University Applied 
Physics Laboratory, Laurel MD.

Abstract Submission is Open!

The 9th Low-Cost Planetary Missions Conference, organized and hosted 
by The Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory in Laurel, 
MD,  is an international forum for planetary scientists, 
technologists, engineers, managers, and agency officials to collect 
and exchange information and ideas for making this class of robotic 
mission scientifically valuable and yet affordably low cost. 

The Low-Cost Planetary Missions conference is designed to increase 
and enhance the global community of practitioners. Areas covered in 
the conference program include, but are not limited to: missions and 
scientific results; mission planning and operations; mission 
management, technology and engineering, and delivery methods. 

The call for papers is posted:
