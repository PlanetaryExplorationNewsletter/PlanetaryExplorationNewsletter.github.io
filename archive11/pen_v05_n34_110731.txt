AGU FALL 2011 SESSION: NG18. TURBULENCE IN GEOPHYSICAL AND 
ASTROPHYSICAL FLUID DYNAMICS

Many of the approaches taken to solve problems in atmospheric and 
oceanic dynamics, mantle convection, dynamo processes, and plasma 
flows are complementary.  In this session, we aim to bring together 
the theoretical, numerical, and experimental work on fundamental fluid 
dynamics from these different fields to promote interaction across the 
spectrum of geophysical and astrophysical fluid dynamics.  In 
particular, we focus on strongly nonlinear dynamics such as: rapidly 
rotating turbulence; MHD turbulence and magnetic field generation; 
atmospheric circulation and jets; heat transfer and mixing in thermal 
turbulence;  double diffusive systems;  and experimental and numerical 
methods of turbulence research.

AGU FALL 2011 SESSION:  P22. PHYLLOSILICATE FORMATION ON MARS -  
CONNECTING EXPERIMENTAL AND THEORETICAL STUDIES WITH PLANETARY 
OBSERVATIONS

Description: Signatures of phyllosilicates have been detected on Mars
using orbital remote sensing. The Opportunity rover is traversing
toward and the upcoming Mars Science Laboratory mission will explore
sites containing such materials. Interpreting orbital and rover
observations of these deposits requires understanding phyllosilicate
composition, occurrence, and formation. This session brings together
experts in detection of phyllosilicates and in experimental and
theoretical studies of phyllosilicate formation and stability. What
are the physiochemical controls on phyllosilicate formation,
stability, and mineral associations and what constraints are provided
by planetary measurements?

AGU FALL 2011 SESSION:  P30. PREPARING FOR THE SCIENCE OF MARS SAMPLE
RETURN

We welcome submissions from a range of disciplines with a friendly 
reminder that submissions are due August 4, 2011.
 
Returned samples may unlock wide-ranging questions about the geology, 
surface processes, and habitability of Mars that cannot be answered by 
study of meteorites or current mission data. The 2013-2022 NRC Decadal 
Survey has thus named its #1 Flagship priority as MAX-C, the first of 
a three-mission, multi-decadal effort to return samples from Mars. 
Continued support by the scientific community will be critical to the 
campaign's success. This session will highlight the large-scale 
implications of existing datasets with an eye toward what may be 
learned when samples are returned. Topics will span planetary science 
including high- and low-T geochemistry, igneous and sedimentary 
petrology, mineral spectroscopy, and astrobiology.

AGU FALL 2011 SESSION:  P31. SATURN - NEW DISCOVERIES FROM THE CASSINI 
ORBITER AND EARTH-BASED OBSERVATORIES

Dear Colleagues,

You are welcome to participate in and submit an abstract to the session 
P31 "Saturn: New Discoveries from the Cassini Orbiter and Earth-Based 
Observatories".

Description: Recent observations from the Cassini orbiter and Earth-
based observatories have revealed new insights into a variety of 
phenomena on Saturn, including aurorae, storms and lightning, zonal 
winds, and deep-seated meteorological systems such as equatorial 
plumes, annular clouds, and the perplexing train of cloud clearings 
known as the "String of Pearls". In late 2010, an unusually large storm 
erupted, the first northern storm observed since 1905. Observed for 
months by both Cassini and Earth-based observatories, this system is 
yielding compositional, dynamical, and chemical insights into the 
workings of storms in the Jovian planets. This session highlights such 
new Saturn discoveries from Earth and by Cassini.

The deadline for abstracts is August 4.

AGU FALL 2011 SESSION:  P32. SCIENCE ENABLED BY THE NASA LUNAR SCIENCE
INSTITUTE (NLSI) - PROGRESS AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS

We are soliciting contributed submissions on all aspects of lunar 
science, including, but not limited to, research enabled by the NASA 
Lunar Science Institute (NLSI). The past three years have witnessed a 
renaissance in lunar science, demonstrated by five major lunar 
missions, the establishment of NLSI and a growing NextGen community.  
We seek presentations on topics ranging from geology/geochemistry, 
impact cratering, lunar formation and solar system dynamics, space 
plasma/exosphere and surface interactions, volatile characterization 
as well as the unique astronomy enabled by the radio-quiet far side of 
the Moon.

FALL AGU SESSION:  P34. USING THE EARTH AS A GUIDE TO EXTRATERRESTRIAL  
PLANETARY SURFACES

We hope you will consider submitting an abstract to session P34:
Using the Earth as a Guide to Extraterrestrial Planetary Surfaces at  
the AGU Fall Meeting 2011.

This session will focus on work that examines planetary surface  
processes and properties through the use of terrestrial analogs. Of  
particular interest will be projects that include terrestrial field  
observations that directly aid in the interpretation of planetary data  
sets. The session will encompass a wide range of topics that are  
expected to include both morphological and compositional studies,  
including both ground-based and orbital data sets; however, all  
studies will be unified by a strong basis in terrestrial geology. The  
goal of this session is to encourage workers to utilize terrestrial  
geological techniques to directly inform interpretations of  
extraterrestrial features, using site-specific examples.

Further details on this session are available at:

[NASA] DUE DATE DELAYED FOR ASTROBIOLOGY: EXOBIOLOGY AND EVOLUTIONARY 
BIOLOGY (EXOB) PROGRAM

To better synchronize the EXOB evaluation and selection cycle with the 
Federal budget process, the EXOB Notice of Intent and proposal due 
dates have changed. To achieve this, the Exobiology proposal due date 
will be moved to the June time frame. To minimize the impact of this 
move, it will be done in two steps. The first step is to move the due 
date for ROSES 2011 (this solicitation) to early March. NASA's 
ROSES-2012 call will not include a solicitation for Exobiology 
proposals. EXOB solicitations will resume in ROSES-2013, with a 
proposal due date of June 2013.

The due date for Notices of Intents has been changed to Friday, 
January 6, 2012. The due date for proposals has been changed to Friday, 
March 2, 2012. Tables 2 and 3 of the Summary of Solicitation for this 
NRA have been updated to reflect this change.

On or about July 28, 2011, this Amendment to the NASA Research 
Announcement "Research Opportunities in Space and Earth Sciences 
(ROSES) 2011" (NNH11ZDA001N) will be posted on the NASA research 
opportunity homepage at:

http://nspires.nasaprs.com/ 
(select "Solicitations" then "Open Solicitations" then "NNH11ZDA001N").
