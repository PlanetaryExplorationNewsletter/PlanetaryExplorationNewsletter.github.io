AGU FALL 2011 SESSION: P06. EVOLUTION AND EXPLORATION OF ASTEROIDS

We would like to invite all interested researchers to submit an 
abstract to this session due on August 4 2011.

Our knowledge of the formation and evolution of large main-belt 
asteroids is expanding rapidly from mission data, ground-based 
observations, and analysis of meteorites. The Rosetta flyby of 
asteroid (21) Lutetia raised tantalizing questions about its 
internal structure and its composition. The arrival of the Dawn 
mission around (4) Vesta, scheduled for July 2011, and the future 
exploration of (1) Ceres are promising future milestones. AO on 
ground-based telescopes allow to map the surface properties of large 
asteroids and also to determine their average densities if they have
satellites. We invite all submissions concerning the formation and 
evolution of asteroids, related analysis of meteorites and 
differentiation modeling.

More information as well as the abstract submission tool can be 
found at the website:

session-search/640

We encourage you to pass this message to any interested colleagues 
and students.

AGU FALL 2011 SESSION: P22. PHYLLOSILICATE FORMATION ON MARS - 
CONNECTING EXPERIMENTAL AND THEORETICAL STUDIES WITH PLANETARY 
OBSERVATIONS

Signatures of phyllosilicates have been detected on Mars using orbital
remote sensing. The Opportunity rover is traversing toward and
the upcoming Mars Science Laboratory mission will explore sites
containing such materials. Interpreting orbital and rover observations
of these deposits requires understanding phyllosilicate composition,
occurrence, and formation. This session brings together experts in
detection of phyllosilicates and in experimental and theoretical
studies of phyllosilicate formation and stability. What are the
physiochemical controls on phyllosilicate formation, stability, and
mineral associations and what constraints are provided by planetary
measurements?

We seek to bring together scientists working on fundamental studies 
of phyllosilicate formation, stability, and occurrence with those
investigating the presence of such phases on Mars. The abstract
submission window is open until August 4, 2011.  Feel free to contact
us with any questions.

AGU FALL 2011 SESSION: P20. NANOCRYSTALLINE MATERIALS ON EARTH AND 
MARS

Poorly crystalline phases such as allophane, imogolite, and 
ferrihydrite are of great interest in terrestrial soil science 
studies, and recent investigations suggest they may be present on  
Mars. These materials, which are precursor phases to more crystalline  
clay minerals and (oxyhydr)oxides, form by near-surface weathering 
processes and thus help constrain past geochemical environments. The 
purpose of this session is to survey the structure, chemistry, and 
analysis of nanocrystalline oxides and aluminosilicates, the chemical
and climatic environments under which they form, and their 
identification and relevance on planetary surfaces, particularly with 
reference to the upcoming Mars Science Laboratory mission.

[NASA] SOLAR ELECTRIC PROPULSION DEMONSTRATION MISSION CONCEPT STUDIES

NASA has issued a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) seeking proposals 
for mission concept studies of a solar electric propulsion system 
demonstration to test and validate key capabilities and technologies 
for future exploration missions.

This Solar Electric Propulsion Demonstration Mission Concept Studies
announcement (NNC11ZMA017K) is open to all non-government United 
States institutions, academia, industry and nonprofit organizations.
NASA anticipates making multiple firm-fixed-priced awards with a 
total value up to $2 million.

NOIs due: July 5
Proposals due: August 4

Responses must be submitted electronically via the NASA Solicitation
and Proposal Integrated Review and Evaluation System (NSPIRES) at:

http://nspires.nasaprs.com

Every organization that intends to submit a proposal in response to 
this BAA must be registered with NSPIRES, and such registration must 
identify the authorized organizational representative(s) who will 
submit the electronic proposal. 

NASA's Glenn Research Center in Cleveland is managing the broad 
agency announcement for the Exploration Systems Mission Directorate 
and relevant technology activities for the Office of the Chief 
Technologist.

[NASA] RELEASE OF A SOLICITATION FOR SOFIA SECOND GENERATION 
INSTRUMENT INVESTIGATIONS

NNH08ZDA009O-SOFIA2G
Release Date: July 8, 2011
Pre-proposal Teleconference: August 4, 2011
NOIs Due: August 15, 2011
Proposals Due: October 7, 2011

This Program Element Appendix is a call for science investigations 
that include the development, delivery, and use of second generation 
instruments for the SOFIA observatory. SOFIA, the Stratospheric 
Observatory for Infrared Astronomy, consists of a German-built 
2.7-meter (2.5-meter useable aperture) telescope mounted in a Boeing 
747-SP aircraft supplied and modified by NASA. Flying at altitudes 
up to 45,000-feet, SOFIA observes from above more than 99 percent of 
Earth's atmospheric water vapor, thereby opening windows to the 
universe not available from the ground. SOFIA offers international 
science teams up to 1000 cloud-free, high-altitude science observing 
hours per year during its two decade design lifetime. Additional 
information on SOFIA may be found at:
 
http://www.sofia.usra.edu/

The full text of the AO and all appendices are available at:

http://nspires.nasaprs.com/ 

(select "Solicitations" then "Open Solicitations" then "NNH08ZDA009O") 

A pre-proposal teleconference will be held; details will be posted at:

APPLICATION DEADLINE FOR THE NASA POSTDOCTORAL PROGRAM

The next deadline to apply for a NASA Postdoctoral Program fellowship 
is July 1, 2011.  These competitive one- to three-year fellowship 
appointments advance NASA's missions in space science, Earth science,
aeronautics, space operations, exploration systems and astrobiology.

Applicants must have a Ph.D. or equivalent degree in hand before 
beginning the fellowship, but may apply while completing the degree 
requirements. U. S. citizens and foreign nationals who hold Lawful 
Permanent Resident status or who are eligible for J-1 status as a 
Research Scholar may apply.  An H-1B Visa status is not acceptable
because the NPP is not an employment program.

Stipend rates for Postdoctoral Fellows start at $50,000 per year, with 
small supplements added for high cost-of-living areas. Funds are 
available for relocation expenses, up to a specified limit.  Fellows 
also receive $8,000 per appointment year to support travel to 
conferences, meetings, and other activities that directly support
their research projects.

Applications for the NASA Postdoctoral Program are accepted three 
times each year: March 1, July 1, and November 1.
