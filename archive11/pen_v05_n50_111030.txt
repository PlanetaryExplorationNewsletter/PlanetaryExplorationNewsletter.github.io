RONALD GREELEY, 1939-2011

It is with deep sadness that we note yet another loss to our community 
this year with the passing of Ronald Greeley on Oct 27th. He was a 
Regents' Professor of planetary geology at Arizona State University 
who has been involved in lunar and planetary studies since 1967 and 
has contributed significantly to our understanding of planetary
bodies within our solar system. He was 72.

2012 LPI SUMMER INTERN PROGRAM IN PLANETARY SCIENCE

Application Deadline:  January 20, 2012

The Lunar and Planetary Institute (LPI) invites undergraduates with at
least 50 semester hours of credit to experience research in the 
planetary sciences. As a summer intern, you will work one-on-one with 
a scientist either at the LPI or NASA Johnson Space Center on a 
research project of current interest in planetary science. Furthermore, 
you will participate in peer-reviewed research, learn from top-notch 
planetary scientists, and preview various careers in science.

The 10-week program begins June 4, 2012, and ends on August 10, 2012.
Selected students will receive a $5000.00 stipend plus a travel 
stipend of $1000.00 (U.S. students) (foreign nationals will receive
a $1500.00 foreign travel reimbursement).

Applications are only accepted via the electronic application form 
found at the LPI's Summer Intern Program website:

http://www.lpi.usra.edu/lpiintern

Faculty members:  Please pass this information on to any of your 
students who might be interested.

POSTDOCTORAL POSITION IN PLANETARY PETROLOGY

The Geology Department at Southern Illinois University Carbondale 
invites applications for a postdoctoral fellowship in planetary 
petrology with a focus on Martian volatiles. The successful candidate 
will work with Dr. Justin Filiberto in NASA-funded efforts, focusing 
on analytical and experimental studies of the pre-eruptive volatile 
contents of Martian basalts. These efforts focus on volatile elements 
(specifically halogens) in planetary magmas, Martian meteorites, 
terrestrial analogs, and experimental studies, starting with analyses
by optical microscopy and electron microprobe.  The candidate will be 
encouraged to design and conduct their own research in petrology. 
Applicants must hold a Ph.D. in geology or a related field or show 
that they will complete all degree requirements by the time of
appointment.  Experience with planetary materials and/or experimental 
equipment is recommended. The position would be for one year, with 
possible extension up to four years depending on performance and 
funding.

Application Deadline: Review of applications will begin immediately 
and continue until the position is filled.

Application Procedure: Applicants should submit a curriculum vitae,
a statement of research interests, and the names and contacts of at 
least three referees to Filiberto@siu.edu
