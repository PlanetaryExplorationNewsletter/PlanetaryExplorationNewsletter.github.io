[NASA] PLANETARY SCIENCE SUMMER SCHOOL APPLICATIONS 

NASA is accepting applications from science and engineering post-docs, 
recent PhDs, and doctoral students for its 23rd Annual Planetary 
Science Summer School, which will hold two separate sessions this 
summer (18-22 July and 1-5 August) at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory 
in Pasadena, Calif. During the program and pre-session webinars, 
student teams will carry out the equivalent of an early mission 
concept study, prepare a proposal authorization review presentation, 
present it to a review board, and receive feedback. By the end of the 
session, students will have a clearer understanding of the life cycle 
of a space mission; relationships between mission design, cost, and 
schedule; and the tradeoffs necessary to stay within cost and schedule 
while preserving the quality of science. Applications are due April 
1st, 2011. Partial financial support is available for a limited number 
of individuals. Further information is available at:

POSTDOCTORAL RESEARCHER IN PLANETARY MAPPING:  LUNAR AND PLANETARY
INSTITUTE

The Universities Space Research Association's Lunar and Planetary 
Institute (LPI), in Houston TX, invites applications for a 
postdoctoral fellowship in planetary science.  The successful 
candidate will work with Dr. Paul Schenk, investigating the topography 
of Jupiter's volcanic moon Io using stereo and shape-from-shading 
techniques (although experience in these tools is not required).  A 
variety of landforms will be mapped, including volcanoes and mountains, 
as well as regional and global scale shape deviations.  The candidate 
will also be expected to develop their own research projects using this 
data.  Candidate must have a recent Ph.D. in geology or geophysics.  
In addition, the candidate shall have a strong background in remote 
sensing/image processing of spacecraft data, and preferably experience 
in geophysical or volcanological investigations.  The position is 
generally for two years, with a possible extension to a maximum of 
three years. Further information on current research and facilities at 
the LPI can be found on our website:

Employer.

DPS-EPSC CONFERENCE SESSION:  THE EXPLORATION OF THE MARTIAN MOONS

We invite for this session, in Nantes in October 2011, papers on the 
results of past or present planetary missions on the Martian Moons, 
and on Phobos in particular. A special emphasis  will be given to the 
January 2011 Mars Express flyby. The following topics can be 
addressed:  position and ephemerids, interior, mass determination, 
gravity  field, subsurface, surface properties, temperatures, 
composition, geology, shape and volume, origin of the moons, solar 
wind interaction. Papers on the future mission Phobos-Grunt and on 
ideas for new missions (in-situ, sample return, manned missions) are 
welcome. Ground-based observations results are also relevant.

PLANETARY DECADAL TOWN HALL MEETING IN ARIZONA

The Planetary Science Institute is hosting a town hall meeting for the 
rollout of the Planetary Decadal Survey, supported by the AAS Division 
for Planetary Sciences. The meeting will be held on Wednesday, March 
30, 1-3 PM Pacific at the Westward Look Resort. Steve Mackwell, 
Steering Committee Member and Director of the Lunar and Planetary 
Institute in Houston, TX, will be representing the Survey. The meeting 
will be available via Webex.

EDITORIAL: PROTECT THE FUTURE OF US SOLAR SYSTEM EXPLORATION

Mark V. Sykes
CEO and Director
Planetary Science Institute

"...We are operating under yet another continuing resolution that 
expires April 8. I encourage EVERYONE to communicate with their 
Congressional representative and Senators and tell them that to 
preserve the seed corn for future solar system exploration by the US, 
while allowing tax payers to realize a return on the large investments 
they have already made in space missions, it is critical that the final 
2011 budget for NASA not reduce planetary research below the 2010 
level. Preferably, the new budget should reflect the Administration's
2011 request for increased funding for planetary research that sought 
in part to restore better balance to planetary programs in general."

"...If Congress cuts the NASA budget across the board by 10% relative 
to 2010, and NASA blindly follows the decadal survey formula, we could 
be years digging out of the current mess."

"...Points to consider [in your communication]"
