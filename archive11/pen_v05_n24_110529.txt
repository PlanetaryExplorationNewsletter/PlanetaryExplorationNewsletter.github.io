ABSTRACTS SOON DUE:  EPSC-DPS MEETING

Dear Colleagues,

We would like to invite you to submit abstracts to the laboratory 
studies session at the joint EPSC-DPS meeting in Nantes, France 
(02-07 October 2011). 

Abstracts Deadline: May 31, 2011

We invite experimentalists, modelers, and observers to submit 
abstracts focusing on "laboratory data, facilities, and needs to 
enhance our understanding of planetary sciences".  This session (LF3)
builds its strength on the tradition of Oxnard, AOGS, AGU, and DPS, 
where we consciously put our efforts to bring the community together 
focusing on Laboratory Studies.

Colleagues who focus on experimental studies that are aimed at 
understanding primitive bodies (asteroids, comets, dust, IDPs), KBOs, 
giant planetary systems, Mars, Moon, and Earth-like exoplanets are 
welcome to submit their abstract to this session. Colleagues who are 
modelers and do observational studies with focused need for new 
experimental data are strongly encouraged to submit their abstract to 
this session as well.

Please do not hesitate to contact us if you have further questions. 

Best Regards
Murthy Gudipati (Convener)
Christophe Cloquet (Co-Convener)

DPS CHILDCARE SURVEY

Please follow the following link and fill out a childcare survey for 
DPS.  It will take 5 minutes, at most.  If you have ever, will ever, 
need now, or don't care at all about childcare, please fill out the 
survey!  This is especially important for those of you who have had 
childcare issues impact your ability to travel.  We will use the 
results of this survey to assess the type of support that the DPS can 
provide.

The Scientific Organizing Committee will do a quick turn-around 
to produce a program for June 10th.

Come talk about the exciting new Cassini data at Saturn!
Predict what Juno will see at Jupiter!

[NASA] NSPIRES RELEASE OF PROCESS ENHANCEMENT FOR PREPARATION, 
SUBMITTAL AND REVIEW OF PROPOSALS

Release 5.3 of NSPIRES is available at:

http://nspires.nasaprs.com

This new release provides enhancements to existing processes involving 
the preparation, submittal and review of proposals.   

Proposal Preparation and Submittal:
The system will automatically block submittal to NASA, e.g. create an 
'error', of a proposal containing unanswered required questions for 
the Program Specific Data element (PSD).

Work-in-progress can be saved on PSD questionnaires, even if there are 
required questions not yet answered.   This section of proposal 
preparation will no longer have to be completed in one session. 

Increased error checking will notify the user if non-required PSD 
questions are unanswered.

The system will issue a warning if an uploaded proposal attachment has
a file size of greater than 17 megabytes.     
 
Peer Review:    
Individual and panel evaluations can be 'Saved as Draft' without 
addressing any required evaluation criteria. 

The system will prevent individual and panel evaluations from being 
'Saved as Final' if required evaluation criteria are not addressed.

A link to the Release 5.3 User Guide for these enhancements is 
available on the NSPIRES website.

If you have questions regarding this NSPIRES release, or any other 
NSPIRES business, please contact the NSPIRES Help Desk:

GSA PLANETARY GEOLOGY DIVISION LOGO DESIGN CONTEST

Dear Planetary Colleagues:

Recent changes in logo guidelines at GSA Headquarters requires the 
Planetary Geology Division to replace it's current logo with a new 
one consistent with the new guidelines.  Thus, the PGD is holding a 
logo design contest to make the new logo.  The winner of the contest 
will receive a $100 cash prize and get to see their emblem on the 
Division's shirts, website, and other items.

If you wish to participate in the contest, please email Division 
Chair David Williams (David.Williams@asu.edu) and he will send you 
the new guidelines for Division logos, and the Adobe Illustrator CS5 
template for you to work with.  The winning logo will be chosen by 
vote of the PGD Management Board and will premire at the 2011 Annual 
Meeting in Minneapolis.

Please submit your entries to David Williams by Monday, July 11, 2011.

Sincerely,
David A. Williams
2011 Chair
Planetary Geology Division
Geological Society of America
