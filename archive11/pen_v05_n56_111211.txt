CANADIAN ASTROBIOLOGY TRAINING PROGRAM

MSc, PhD, Post Doctoral Fellow positions available 2012

Astrobiology is broadly defined as the scientific study of the origin, 
evolution, distribution, conditions and destiny of life in the 
universe. The Canadian Astrobiology Training Program (CATP) is the 
first Canadian cross-disciplinary, multi-institutional undergraduate, 
graduate and postdoctoral training program in Astrobiology and is a 
NSERC-funded Collaborative Research and Training Experience Program 
(CREATE) (2009-2015) located at Canadian universities (McGill, 
McMaster, Western Ontario, Toronto, and Winnipeg). CATP by its very 
nature will be accomplished through collaborative and integrative 
research approaches containing elements of geology, chemistry, 
physics, astronomy, microbiology, and robotics. CATP trainees over 
the next 5 years will be exposed to innovative research and training 
approaches, combining fieldwork at unique Canadian analogue sites, 
including those in the high Arctic, with laboratory work at cutting 
edge analytical facilities at participating university, government, 
and industry partners. Professional training will be enhanced by 
training rotations with our collaborators and our international 
partners. 

Applications will be received until January 25, 2012 for Graduate 
Student Fellowships (MSc and PhD) and Post Doctoral Fellowship (PDF) 
positions in 2012.

Detailed information on the CATP, contact information and how to 
apply may be obtained at (http://create-astrobiology.mcgill.ca/)

NASA POSTDOCTORAL FELLOWSHIPS

The NASA Postdoctoral Program (NPP) offers scientists and engineers 
unique opportunities to conduct research at NASA Centers. Each NPP 
fellowship opportunity is designed to advance NASA research in a 
specific project related to space science, earth science, aeronautics,
space operations, exploration systems, lunar science, or astrobiology.

Applicants must have a Ph.D. or equivalent degree in hand before 
beginning the fellowship, but may apply while completing the degree 
requirements. U. S. citizens, Lawful Permanent Residents, and foreign 
nationals eligible for J-1 status as a Research Scholar may apply.  
An H-1B Visa status is not acceptable because the NPP is not an 
employment program.

Stipends for Postdoctoral Fellows start at $50,000 per year, with 
moderate supplements for high cost-of-living areas and for certain 
academic specialties. Funds are available for relocation expenses, 
up to a specified limit, and health insurance is available through 
the program. Fellows also receive $8,000 per appointment year to 
support travel to conferences, meetings, and other activities that 
directly support their research.

Applications are accepted three times each year: March 1, July 1, 
and November 1.

[NASA] ASTROBIOLOGY INSTITUTE CYCLE 6 CAN AMENDMENT 

NNH12ZDA002C
Release Date:  October 11, 2011
Proposals Due:  February 15, 2012

With this amendment, the proposal due date for NASA Cooperative 
Agreement Notice (CAN) NNH11ZDA012O, "NASA Astrobiology Institute 
(NAI) - Cycle 6," has been delayed to February 15, 2012.  Due to the 
large number of time consuming activities between November and the 
end of January encountered by the Planetary Science and Astrobiology 
community, the proposal due date for the NAI Cycle 6 CAN has been 
changed to February 15, 2012.

Details are posted at the NASA research opportunity homepage:

http://nspires.nasaprs.com/

THE PLUTO SYSTEM ON THE EVE OF EXPLORATION BY NEW HORIZONS: 
PERSPECTIVES AND PREDICTIONS

24-26 July 2013
Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory, Columbia, Md
 
NASA's New Horizons mission is now over 22 AU from the Sun en route 
to a reconnaissance flyby of the Pluto system at 32 AU in July, 2015.
In advance of that historic flyby, the New Horizons mission is 
sponsoring a scientific meeting to review knowledge of the Pluto 
System, to inform the planetary science community about the flyby 
and collaboration/DAP funding opportunities, to discuss and begin to 
prepare groundbased and spacebased observing proposals, and to 
provide a venue for scientific predictions.
