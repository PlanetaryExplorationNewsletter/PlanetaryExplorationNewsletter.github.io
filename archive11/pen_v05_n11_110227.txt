POSTDOCTORAL POSITION IN JPL'S PLANETARY ICES GROUP

Position Title: Comet and Asteroid Observer

The research will involve supporting a variety of programs in studying 
small bodies in the solar system, i.e., comets and asteroids. The 
post-doc will also develop his/her own research program in a topic of 
their choosing.  

Candidates should have a recent PhD in in Planetary Science, Astronomy 
or a related area with a strong background in solar system 
observational astronomy, in particular CCD photometry of small bodies 
in the solar system, along with data reduction and analysis. The annual 
starting salary for recent PhDs is $52,000 USD and can vary somewhat 
according to the selected applicant's qualifications. Postdoctoral 
Scholar positions are awarded for a one-year period. Appointments may 
be renewed in one-year increments for a maximum addition of two years.

COSMIC DUST AT AOGS 2011: CALL FOR ABSTRACT SUBMISSION

Meeting Title: 
Asia Oceania Geosciences Society 8th Annual Meeting (AOGS 2011)

Date: August 8-12, 2011
Location: Taipei, Taiwan

Session URL:
http://www.asiaoceania.org/aogs2011/mars/confSessionView.asp?sID=18

Session Description:
A primary goal of this session is to find a consensus among experts in 
the formation and evolution of cosmic dust: where it comes from and 
where it goes. All kinds of cosmic dust such as intergalactic dust, 
interstellar dust, circumstellar dust, cometary dust, asteroidal dust, 
interplanetary dust, circumplanetary dust, stellar nebular condensates, 
presolar grains, micrometeorites, meteoroids, meteors, and regolith 
particles are the subject of discussion. The session will address 
interrelation between them and perceptions on the dust alteration 
through a variety of processing. This includes different methods of 
its determination (in-situ and laboratory measurements, astronomical 
observations, laboratory and numerical analogue simulations, 
theoretical modeling, etc.). However, the session is open for any other 
aspects of dust research. We plan to publish the proceedings of this 
session.

JOINT ASSEMBLY: CPS 8TH INTERNATIONAL SCHOOL OF PLANETARY SCIENCES

JSPS-DST Asia Academic Seminar

Date: 26 September - 1 October 2011,
1-3 October 2011 for a facility tour [only for a limited number of 
participants]

Venue: Minami-Awaji Royal Hotel, Minamiawaji, Japan

https://www.cps-jp.org/~pschool/pub/2011-09-26/index.html

Topic of the coming school: 

Challenges in Astronomy: Observational Advances

The objective of the school/seminar is to promote education and 
research in planetary sciences for highly motivated graduate students 
and young researchers by providing them with an opportunity to interact 
with leading scientists in a specific field. Note that the term 
"Planetary Sciences" is used in a broader sense to include astronomy, 
astrophysics, astrochemistry, astrobiology, astromineralogy,
geosciences, space science, cosmology, and other related fields.

PLANETARY SCIENCE DECADAL SURVEY UPDATE

The planetary science decadal survey report, "Vision and Voyages for 
Planetary Science in the Decade 2013-2022," was approved for release 
by the NRC on Tuesday 22 February and a prepublication draft of the 
report was delivered to NASA and NSF on Friday 25 February.  Steven 
Squyres and members of the survey committee will brief NASA, NSF, and 
other organizations, agencies and groups in Washington, D.C., during 
the week beginning 28 February.  The public unveiling of the report 
will take place in a special session at the 42nd Lunar and Planetary 
Science Conference on Monday 7 March.  The LPSC session will be 
webcast. For details see:
