PASSING OF JAMES L. ELLIOT (1943-2011) 

James L. Elliot, Professor of Planetary Astronomy and Physics and 
Director of the George R. Wallace, Jr. Astrophysical Observatory at 
MIT, passed away Wednesday night March 2, 2011. Jim was one of the 
pioneers in using stellar occultations to probe planetary atmospheres 
and the physical properties of small bodies in the outer solar system 
and beyond. Among his accomplishments are the discoveries of the ring 
system of Uranus and the atmosphere of Pluto. He received his 
undergraduate degree from MIT in 1965 and his Ph.D. from Harvard in 
1972. Before returning to MIT in 1978, he was a postdoc and faculty 
member in the Astronomy Department of Cornell University. Jim was a 
wonderful mentor and teacher, and was especially supportive of women 
in astronomy. He was an avid gardener, hiker, and Ohio State football 
fan. His easy laughter and sense of humor will be deeply missed.

FIRST ANNOUNCEMENT - LUNGRADCON 2011

The 2nd Annual Lunar Graduate Conference (LunGradCon 2011) will be
held on Sunday, July 17, 2011 at the NASA Ames Research Center (ARC),
preceeding the NASA Lunar Science Forum. 

LunGradCon provides an opportunity for grad students and early-career 
postdocs to present their research on lunar science in a low-stress, 
friendly environment, being critiqued only by their peers. In addition 
to oral presentations, the conference presents opportunities for 
networking with fellow grad students and postdocs, as well as senior 
members of the NASA Lunar Science Institute. A limited amount of 
funding will be provided for travel and lodging costs.

[NASA] INFRARED TELESCOPE FACILITY OBSERVING PROPOSALS 

Due date for August 1, 2011 to January 31, 2012 observing is Friday, 
April 1, 2011.  For submission form see:

http://irtfweb.ifa.hawaii.edu/observing/applicationForms.php 

Available instruments include:  (1) SpeX, a 1-5 micron cross-dispersed 
medium-resolution spectrograph (up to R=2,500);  (2) CSHELL, a 1-5 
micron high-resolution spectrograph (up to R=40,000);  (3) MIRSI, a 5 
to 25 micron camera and low-resolution spectrometer (R=100 to 200), 
(4) NSFCAM2, a 2048x2048 pixel, 1-5 micron camera with a 0.04"/pixel 
scale (40"x40" field-of-view) and a circular variable filter; and 
(5) PI-instruments including a low-resolution 3-14 micron spectrograph 
and high-resolution spectrographs for 8-25 microns.  Information can 
be found at: 

http://irtfweb.ifa.hawaii.edu/Facility/

Important:  NSFCAM2 will be taken off line on Oct. 1, 2011, to install 
a new infrared array.  We expect it to be available starting in Feb. 1, 
2012 - July 31, 2012.  Near-infrared imaging is suitable for some 
projects with the SpeX slit viewer which has 0.12"/pixel and a 60"x60" 
field-of-view.

SpeX will be taken off line from Aug. 1, 2012 - Jan. 31, 2013.  This 
is necessary to upgrade SpeX with new arrays and array controllers. We 
expect to accommodate key projects requiring large amounts of observing 
time using CSHELL, NSFCAM2, MIRSI, MORIS, and visitor instruments.

INVITATION TO LUNCHEON MEETING BETWEEN INDUSTRY AND SCIENCE 
COMMUNITIES ON NEOS AT LPSC

When: Wednesday, March 09, 2011 Noon-1:00 PM Central Time

Where:  The Woodlands Waterway Marriott Hotel and Convention Center 
- Indian Springs conference room

Format: roundtable dialogue, no presentations, moderated

NEOs have continued to grow in interest within both the science and 
exploration communities as well as emerging industry interest. There 
have been some recent discussions on data-sets associated with different 
NEO/Asteroids missions. We discussed the survey vs characterization, 
leading to sub-dividing characterization into spectral vs physical. 
Several commercial groups have come forward with interest in 
commercially-provided data sets relative to the physical 
characterization by employing low-cost, min-sat visits to the objects; 
while others are most interested in the survey/cataloging sets. This 
luncheon is focused at providing a informal forum for discussions 
between the science community and industry relative to NEOs.
