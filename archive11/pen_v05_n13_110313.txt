STATUS AT SENDAI (TOHOKU UNIVERSITY) JAPAN

From: 
Yasumasa Kasaba 
Department of Geophysics, 
Graduate School of Science, 
Tohoku University
Current Email: kasabaya888@dk2.so-net.ne.jp [Normal email, 
kasaba@pat.gp.tohoku.ac.jp is not available because of loss of power 
at Tohoku University]

I am unfortunately at Uppsala, Sweden now. Not at Sendai. Based on 
emails with my colleagues and web information, the current status of 
the Tohoku University Group at Sendai is as follows.

I confirmed that all our members I could catch were safe.

Center of Sendai (including Tohoku University): 

It has relatively stronger ground. It has partially recovered from 
water, but there is no power. There is rare fire.

East area: 

Worse. Worst at the coast area by Tsunami.

Guests staying at Sendai for the International Symposium on 
Planetary Science:

There were numerous guests in this week for a large workshop. 
If you need to confirm and contact, please let me know. I will try 
to search.

I try to be back tomorrow. It seems possible to reach Tokyo (or Osaka) 
in the morning on 13 March. But at the moment, I do not find a route 
to my home.

NASA CENTER FOR LUNAR DUST AND ATMOSPHERIC STUDIES (NLSI/CCLDAS)

NASA Lunar Science Institute's Colorado Center for Lunar Dust and 
Atmospheric Studies (NLSI/CCLDAS) has completed the construction of 
a 3 MV electrostatic dust accelerator. The device is capable of 
accelerating ~ 0.01 - 10-micron radius dust particles to velocities in 
the approximate range of 1-60 km/s. The experimental goals of CCLDAS 
include the effects of hypervelocity dust impacts on: 
a) optical devices
b) secondary dust ejecta, neutral gas, and plasma production
c) electrical signals from antennas
d) the testing and calibration of dedicated dust instrumentation 

The facility is available for use by the lunar and space physics 
communities.  Please contact Mihaly Horanyi (horanyi@colorado.edu) 
if you are interested in using this facility.

[NASA] UNIQUE AND INNOVATIVE SPACE TECHNOLOGY BROAD AGENCY ANNOUNCEMENT

The Game Changing Technology Division, within NASA's Office Of Chief 
Technologist (OCT) is soliciting executive summaries, white papers, 
and proposals for research and development for technology that is 
innovative and unique and promises to enable revolutionary 
(game-changing) improvements to the efficiency and effectiveness of 
our country's space capability. Novel (unique) capabilities are sought 
in any of the NASA Space Technology Grand Challenges or the NASA draft 
Space Technology Roadmaps. Responses may be submitted at any time 
while this solicitation is open. Responses will be reviewed and award 
decisions made throughout the year.
Final due dates are: 
Executive Summary: October 1, 2011
White Paper: November 1, 2011
Proposal: January 3, 2012.

[NASA] INNOVATIVE ADVANCED CONCEPTS RESEARCH ANNOUNCEMENT

This announcement solicits multiple studies, each of which will 
investigate an architecture, mission, or system concept that has the 
potential to change the possible in aeronautics or space. NASA 
Innovative Advanced Concepts (NIAC) is part of the Office Of Chief 
Technologist (OCT). Concepts proposed for NIAC Phase I studies must 
be innovative and visionary, technically substantiated, and very early
in development (10+ years out; Technology Readiness Level 1, 2, or 
early 3). Focused technology maturation and incremental improvement 
are explicitly not of interest in this program. Finally, while NIAC 
encourages great leaps and accepts the accompanying risk, all 
proposals must be technically credible, based on sound scientific 
principles. NOIs are strongly encouraged by March 29, 2011. 
Final proposals are due May 2, 2011.

[NASA] TECHNOLOGY DEMONSTRATION MISSIONS PROGRAM BROAD AGENCY 
ANNOUNCEMENT

This announcement solicits proposals for the demonstration of space 
technologies that provide new system-level technological capabilities.
The Office Of Chief Technologist's (OCT) Technology Demonstration 
Missions Program is seeking to identify candidate crosscutting, 
system-level technologies to be demonstrated in the relevant 
environment such as ground, air, suborbital, or orbital regimes. A 
key requirement in this program is that the technology under 
consideration must clearly be crosscutting. Crosscutting is defined 
as a technology with potential to benefit more than one customer, where 
a customer can be a NASA Mission Directorate, another government 
agency, academia, or the aerospace industry. Proposals will be due on 
or before May 31, 2011.

REQUEST FOR INPUT ON USGS/ISIS SOFTWARE SUPPORT FOR ADDITIONAL 
PLANETARY IMAGING INSTRUMENTS

We request your vote on which additional instruments should be 
supported by USGS/ISIS 3 software.  The results will help us to 
prioritize planetary imaging instruments for development of ISIS 3 
camera models.  Such models allow ingestion and map projection of image 
data in ISIS 3 and facilitate the use of other ISIS 3 software for 
calibration, photometric correction, mosaicking and other cartographic 
data processing.  Please respond by April 8, 2011.

To provide input, please first register at the ISIS Support site:

https://isis.astrogeology.usgs.gov/IsisSupport/
index.php?action=register

FIRST ANNOUNCEMENT FOR THE ENCELADUS FOCUS GROUP MEETING

This meeting will be held at SETI Institute in Mountain View, 
California on May 23/24, 2011. 
The  meeting's focus is on the current activity discovered at 
the south pole of Enceladus, and on the significance and implications 
of this discovery for the presence of liquid water and a habitable 
zone beneath the south polar terrain and for astrobiology.

We request presentations falling within four broad areas:
1. Energy/Mechanisms: The jetting activity at Enceladus' south pole, 
    and related geological and geophysical investigations; the moon's 
    energy budget and thermal/geological history.
2. Habitability: Is there a liquid water reservoir beneath the surface 
    of Enceladus?
3. Biomarkers/Astrobiology: Biomarkers in the plume: What has been, or 
    can be, observed from Cassini; What should be sought in the future; 
    Relevant astrobiological considerations.
4. Future Missions: Mission requirements and concepts for future 
    exploration of Enceladus

The meeting is sponsored by:
The Cassini Imaging Central Laboratory for Operations (CICLOPS) at the 
Space Science Institute in Boulder, Colorado
SETI Institute in Mountain View, California
The Center for Integrative Planetary Science (CIPS) at UC Berkeley

Organizers: Carolyn Porco and Chris McKay
