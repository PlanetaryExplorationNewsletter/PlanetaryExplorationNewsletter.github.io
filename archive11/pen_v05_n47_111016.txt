WILLIAM H. SMYTH, 1941-2011

William H. Smyth passed away on Friday Sept. 30, 2011 after a long 
illness.  He is survived by his wife Iris (of 43 years), three 
children and five grandchildren.

Bill graduated from Harvard in 1972 and after a postcoc with Michael
McElroy working on Voyager observations he became an early member of 
AER in Lexington Ma., where he spent almost all of his career.

Bill was a leader in planetary exospheres and conducted pioneering
research on the exospheres of Io, Europa, Mercury, the moon, comets,
and the Saturnian H cloud, especially in complex orbital environments.
His expertise on Io's neutral clouds and the plasma torus were second
to none. Bill constructed the first successful model of Io's neutral 
clouds and studied their response to and the resulting mass loading 
of Jupiter's magnetosphere. This led to his serving as an IDS with
the Galileo mission.

Recently, Bill extended his research to the denser parts of the 
atmosphere and pioneered the consistent physical description of 
atmospheres through all degrees of collisionality.  Bill was equally 
comfortable developing theory and analyzing observations. His 
meticulous penetrating research, persistent search for the underlying 
truth, honesty, and integrity will be deeply missed.

REGISTRATION AND ABSTRACT SUBMITTAL FOR THE 2012 NEXT-GENERATION 
SUBORBITAL RESEARCHERS CONFERENCE (NSRC-2012) IS NOW OPEN

Hosted by NASA Ames, SwRI, and the Commercial Spaceflight Federation,
NSRC is THE meeting for researchers and educators wanting to 
participate in, learn about, and contribute to the new era of 
commercial, reusable suborbital spaceflight. In 2011, over 350 people 
participated, and over 400 are expected this year.

Reserve your seat by registering today at: 

http://nsrc.swri.org/ 

Abstracts for talks should also be submitted at this web site. The 
conference will take place at the Crowne Royal hotel in Palo Alto near 
NASA Ames February 27 to 29. Students may register at a deeply 
discounted rate.

Sessions range over topics from planetary science, atmospheric 
science, and astro/solar physics applications of next-gen suborbital 
vehicles for research, to how-to panels and talks on the various 
launch companies and NASA's funding for work aboard these vehicles.

On behalf of the sponsors and the conveners of NSRC-2012, we look 
forward to your participation in NSRC in Palo Alto this February, and 
encourage your early (and discounted) registration.

POSTDOCTORAL RESEARCHERS IN LUNAR SCIENCE

The Universities Space Research Association's Lunar and Planetary 
Institute (LPI) invites applications for lunar science and exploration 
postdoctoral fellowships.  Opportunities include:

Lunar Surface Geology and Remote Sensing - Using new LRO data; 
integrating it with existing lunar data to evaluate processes 
associated with impact cratering and/or planetary differentiation.  
Experience with orbital remote sensing methods, photometry of lunar 
materials, and photogeology of lunar or lunar-like terrains preferred. 

Experimental and/or Analytical Petrology and Geochemistry - Using 
Apollo and lunar meteorite samples (or synthetic analogues) to evaluate 
processes associated with impact cratering and/or planetary 
differentiation.  Experience with electron and ion microprobes, and/or 
LA-ICPMS techniques preferred.

Modeling of Impact Cratering Processes - Using hydrocodes and relevant 
analytical techniques to evaluate different cratering processes on the 
Moon, to model specific crater or basin-forming events, and potentially 
guide future exploration scenarios. 

The successful candidate will be a member of the new LPI-JSC Center for 
Lunar Science and Exploration (http://www.lpi.usra.edu/nlsi/), one of 
the core teams within the NASA Lunar Science Institute. 
           
Further information, including submission requirements are found at:

http://www.lpi.usra.edu  

Questions regarding science involved in the position, contact 
Dr. David Kring (kring@lpi.usra.edu).

CALTECH-JPL POSTDOCTORAL SCHOLAR POSITIONS IN MARS ATMOSPHERIC 
STRUCTURE, COMPOSITION AND DYNAMICS
 
This opportunity will involve analysis and modeling of data collected 
by the Mars Climate Sounder (MCS) instrument on board the Mars 
Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO) spacecraft. MCS is an advanced 
limb-sounding infrared radiometer that collects data in one visible and 
8 infrared channels, to characterize Mars' atmospheric temperature 
structure and aerosol loading. MCS has been collecting data at Mars 
since September 2006. The successful candidate(s) will work with Level 
2 data (retrieved profiles of temperature, pressure, and ice and dust 
abundance) to study Martian atmospheric dynamics (including tides) and 
the distribution and properties of Martian clouds and dust. 
Dr. David M. Kass, in JPL's Division 32, will serve as JPL postdoctoral 
advisor to the selected candidate(s). The appointee(s) will carry out 
research in collaboration with the JPL advisor and the MCS team.

Please send a letter describing your research interests, a curriculum 
vitae, a list of three references (with telephone numbers, postal and 
email addresses), and arrange reference letters to be sent to:

ASTRONOMY EDUCATION REVIEW CELEBRATES 10TH ANNIVERSARY

Astronomy Education Review (AER), the on-line journal/magazine about 
astronomy education and outreach, published by the American 
Astronomical Society, celebrates its 10th  anniversary of publication 
this fall. The first paper in the journal, founded by Andrew Fraknoi 
(Foothill College) and Sidney Wolff (NOAO), came on line in October 
2001. After being published by the National Optical Astronomy 
Observatories, with support from NASA and other organizations, AER 
became a publication of the American Astronomical Society, the U.S. 
professional organization of astronomers, in 2009.  Wolff retired at 
that time, but Fraknoi continues to assist the editor-in-chief, Thomas 
Hockey, of the University of Northern Iowa.

The journal can be read at no charge at the web address: 

http://aer.aas.org

AER now publishes the overwhelming majority of research papers about 
astronomy education, by authors from around the world. It also features 
shorter pieces on innovative techniques and materials, resource guides 
and reviews, dissertation abstracts, op-ed pieces, letters and 
announcements. In the first 8 months of 2011, the journal had readers 
in 98 countries and had 14,000 unique visitors to its site. All 
contributions (except announcements) are peer-reviewed.

DEADLINE APPROACHING FOR NASA POSTDOCTORAL FELLOWSHIP

The next deadline to apply for a NASA Postdoctoral Program (NPP) 
fellowship is November 1, 2011.  These competitive one- to three-year 
appointments advance NASA's missions in space science, earth science, 
aeronautics, space operations, exploration systems, lunar science, and 
astrobiology.

Applicants must have a Ph.D. or equivalent degree in hand before 
beginning the fellowship, but may apply while completing the degree 
requirements. U. S. citizens and foreign nationals who hold Lawful 
Permanent Resident status or who are eligible for J-1 status as a 
Research Scholar may apply.  An H-1B Visa status is not acceptable 
because the NPP is not an employment program.

Stipend rates for Postdoctoral Fellows start at $50,000 per year, 
with moderate supplements for high cost-of-living areas and for 
certain academic specialties. Funds are available for relocation 
expenses, up to a specified limit, and health insurance is available 
through the program. Fellows also receive $8,000 per appointment year 
to support travel to conferences, meetings, and other activities that 
directly support their research.
