ANDREW DANTZLER, 1962-2011

Andrew A. Dantzler died unexpectedly Thursday, October 13, 2011.  Andy
worked at NASA from 1984-2006, serving as an optical engineer, Earth
Observing System manager, Landsat 7 instrument manager, assistant 
chief of the Laboratory for High Energy Astrophysics, and Director of 
the Solar System Exploration Division at NASA Headquarters.

In 2006, Andy joined The Johns Hopkins University APL's Civilian Space
Business Area to lead the Living with a Star Missions, which explore 
how the Sun's high-energy rays and energetic particles can generate
hazardous space weather effects near the Earth and affect satellite
operations, as well as the Earth's climate.  Andy was also the first 
Solar Probe Plus program manager.  Solar Probe Plus will journey 
closer to the Sun than any probe has ever gone.

Andy was promoted to Program Area Manager for Civilian Space in July 
2009 - a position that had him overseeing program management for all
Civilian Space programs at APL, including the MESSENGER mission, now 
in orbit about Mercury, and the New Horizons mission on its way to 
Pluto and the Kuiper Belt.  Online condolences may be offered at:

"DESCUBRIMIENTOS EN CIENCIAS PLANETARIAS": CLASSROOM POWERPOINTS 
AVAILABLE IN SPANISH 

The Division for Planetary Sciences of America Astronomical Society 
announces the release of "Descubrimientos en Ciencias Planetarias",
the Spanish translation of the "DPS Discoveries" Classroom Powerpoints. 
We're grateful to Pedro Sada, Universidad de Monterrey, Mexico for his 
efforts. The most recent release in both languages is "A Planet 
Orbiting Two Suns" about the recently discovered planet nicknamed 
"Tatooine". 

These classroom slidesets are succinct summaries of discoveries too 
recent to appear in "Intro Astronomy" college textbooks; each set 
consists of just three slides to be shown: the discovery itself, a 
basic explanation based on good planetary science, and the "big 
picture" context. Another page for further information is provided as 
well. Powerpoints and PDFs can be downloaded from: 

http://dps.aas.org/education/dpsdisc 

that has links to the Spanish and English versions.  The 22 previous 
releases cover a wide range of topics including Mars, Extrasolar 
Planets, Titan, the Moon, Enceladus, Iapetus, Venus, Mercury, 
Saturn's rings, solar system formation, and meteorites.

[NASA] KEPLER GUEST OBSERVER PROGRAM: REVISED TEXT AND NEW DUE DATES

Amendment 28 provides revised text and new due dates for The Kepler 
Guest Observer Program.  This Amendment to the NASA Research 
Announcement "Research Opportunities in Space and Earth Sciences 
(ROSES) 2011" (NNH11ZDA001N) is posted on the NASA research 
opportunity homepage at:

http://nspires.nasaprs.com/ 

(select "Solicitations" then "Open Solicitations" then "NNH11ZDA001N"). 

The major change to the text is the elimination of the exclusive use 
period associated with Cycle 4 GO data.  The new due date for notices 
of intent to propose is December 5, 2011, and the new due date for 
proposals is January 20, 2012.

PRESENTATIONS TO NASA PSS POSTED ON LPI SITE

The Planetary Science Subcommittee of the NASA Advisory Council (NAC)
reports to the Science Committee of the NAC. Regular meetings are held
for the purpose of soliciting from the scientific community and other
persons scientific and technical information relevant to program
planning. 

The latest PSS telecon was on October 13.

Presentations by Jim Green and Eric Smith on the Impact of JWST on the 
Planetary Budget as well as other presentations are now available
at LPI's unofficial PSS site:

DEADLINE APPROACHING FOR NASA POSTDOCTORAL FELLOWSHIP

The next deadline to apply for a NASA Postdoctoral Program (NPP) 
fellowship is November 1, 2011.  These competitive one- to three-year 
appointments advance NASA's missions in space science, earth science, 
aeronautics, space operations, exploration systems, lunar science, and 
astrobiology.

Applicants must have a Ph.D. or equivalent degree in hand before 
beginning the fellowship, but may apply while completing the degree 
requirements. U. S. citizens and foreign nationals who hold Lawful 
Permanent Resident status or who are eligible for J-1 status as a 
Research Scholar may apply.  An H-1B Visa status is not acceptable 
because the NPP is not an employment program.

Stipend rates for Postdoctoral Fellows start at $50,000 per year, 
with moderate supplements for high cost-of-living areas and for 
certain academic specialties. Funds are available for relocation 
expenses, up to a specified limit, and health insurance is available 
through the program. Fellows also receive $8,000 per appointment year 
to support travel to conferences, meetings, and other activities that 
directly support their research.

LUNAR EXPLORATION SUMMER INTERN PROGRAM

The Lunar and Planetary Institute (LPI) is hosting a special lunar 
exploration summer intern program to evaluate possible landing sites 
for robotic and human exploration missions. The LPI invites 
applications from graduate students in geology, planetary science, 
and related programs. The program is also open to undergraduate 
students in geology, astronomy, chemistry, and physics with at least 
50 semester hours of credit.  The goal of this program is to integrate 
NASA's lunar science priorities with the exploration components of the 
new exploration program that takes us beyond low-Earth orbit. This 
will be a unique team activity that should foster extensive 
discussions among students and senior science team members.  The 
10-week program runs from May 29, 2012, through August 3, 2012. Selected 
interns will receive a $5000 stipend to cover the costs associated with 
being in Houston for the duration of the program. Additionally, U.S. 
citizens will receive up to $1000 in travel expense reimbursement, and 
foreign nationals will receive up to $1500 in travel expense 
reimbursement.  Please pass this information on to any students who 
might be interested.  Application deadline is January 20, 2012.
