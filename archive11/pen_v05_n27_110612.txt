PEN UNSUBSCRIBE ATTACK

A robotic attack managed to unsubscribe more than 20 PEN subscribers
this morning - the clue being that it was nearly simultaneous. These
were all resubscribed. The unsubscribe page will be disabled. Those who
would like to unsubscribe, please send an email to pen_editor@psi.edu.

Thank you!

[NASA] LUNAR SCIENCE FORUM - FINAL ANNOUNCEMENT

The 4th annual NASA Lunar Science Forum will be held July 19-21, 2011 
at NASA Ames Research Center in Moffett Field, CA.

Registration for the Forum is FREE and will remain open until June 30th 
- Please register early.  International visitors MUST have registered 
by June 5th, 2011 in order to process your NASA visitor information.

This year's Forum will feature sessions on in-depth scientific results 
from the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter and Lunar Crater Observation and 
Sensing Satellite, a dedicated side-conference for graduate students 
and young lunar professionals, as well as the annual recognition of 
scientific accomplishments and associated keynote lecture.  As in past 
years, science sessions are structured to report on both recent results 
and future opportunities for lunar science, exploration, education and 
outreach. We also look forward to news on the upcoming lunar missions 
GRAIL and LADEE, and welcome abstracts across the many fields of lunar 
science.

We look forward to another exciting meeting focusing on science of, on 
and from the Moon!

SECOND ANNUAL LUNAGRADCON 2011

The 2nd Annual Lunar Graduate Conference (LunGradCon 2011) will be held 
on Sunday, July 17, 2011 at the NASA Ames Research Center (ARC), 
preceeding the NASA Lunar Science Forum. LunGradCon provides an 
opportunity for grad students and early-career postdocs to present 
their research on lunar science in a low-stress, friendly environment, 
being critiqued only by their peers. In addition to oral presentations, 
the conference presents opportunities for networking with fellow grad 
students and postdocs, as well as senior members of the NASA Lunar 
Science Institute. A limited amount of funding will be provided for 
travel and lodging costs.

2011 NEXT GENERATION LUNAR SCIENTISTS & ENGINEERS WORKSHOP

The 3rd annual Next Generation Lunar Scientists & Engineers (NGLSE) 
Workshop will be help on Monday, July 19, 2011 at the NASA Ames 
Research Center (ARC), preceding the NASA Lunar Science Forum. This 
one-day workshop for graduate students and early career professionals 
offers the opportunity for participants to network with other students/ 
early career professionals, and will specifically include a media 
training workshop. The purpose of this group is to engage and develop 
the next generation of lunar scientists and engineers, and to enable 
their successful involvement in current planning for the exploration 
of the Moon.

APPLICATION DEADLINE FOR THE NASA POSTDOCTORAL PROGRAM

The next deadline to apply for a NASA Postdoctoral Program fellowship 
is July 1, 2011.  These competitive one- to three-year fellowship 
appointments advance NASA's missions in space science, Earth science, 
aeronautics, space operations, exploration systems and astrobiology.
 
Applicants must have a Ph.D. or equivalent degree in hand before 
beginning the fellowship, but may apply while completing the 
dissertation. U. S. citizens and foreign nationals who hold Lawful 
Permanent Resident status or who are eligible for J-1 status as a 
Research Scholar may apply. An H-1B Visa status is not acceptable 
because the NPP is not an employment program.
 
Stipend rates for Postdoctoral Fellows start at $50,000 per year, with 
small supplements added for high cost-of-living areas. Funds are 
available for relocation expenses, up to a specified limit. Fellows 
also receive $8,000 per appointment year to support travel to 
conferences, meetings, and other activities that directly support 
their research projects.
 
Applications for the NASA Postdoctoral Program are accepted three times 
each year: March 1, July 1, and November 1.

[NASA] NOIS FOR PIDD AND ASTID ARE DUE 7/1/2011

The Planetary Instrument Definition and Development Program (PIDDP) 
supports the advancement of spacecraft-based instrument technology that 
shows promise for use in scientific investigations on future planetary 
missions. The goal of the program is not to develop flight-qualified 
hardware, but rather to define and develop scientific 
instruments/components to the point where the instruments may be 
proposed in response to future announcements of flight opportunity 
without additional extensive technology development.

The Astrobiology Science and Technology for Instrument Development 
(ASTID) program element requests proposals to develop instrumentation 
capabilities to help meet Astrobiology science requirements on future 
space flight missions, as well as unique Astrobiology science 
objectives on Earth. Selected activities are expected to advance the 
development of scientific instruments/components to the point where 
the instruments could credibly be proposed in response to future 
flight opportunity announcements. The development of instruments for 
use in future field campaigns is solicited under the Astrobiology 
Science and Technology for Exploring Planets (ASTEP) program.

FALL AGU SESSION P05: COORDINATED MINERALOGY AND MORPHOLOGY STUDIES OF
MARTIAN AQUEOUS DEPOSITS

We hope you will consider submitting an abstract to session P05:
Coordinated Mineralogy and Morphology Studies of Martian Aqueous
Deposits at the AGU Fall Meeting 2011.

This session focuses on coordinated investigations of mineralogy and  
morphology, including surface and orbital data, in order to gain new  
insights into aqueous outcrops on Mars and the geochemical  
environments of their formation.

Conveners:

Janice Bishop, SETI Institute & NASA-ARC
Catherine Weitz, Planetary Sciences Institute
James Wray, Cornell University & Georgia Tech.

The meeting is December 5-9, 2011 in San Francisco. The abstract
deadline is August 4, 2011.

COMET ELENIN WILL NOT MEAN THE END OF THE WORLD IN SEPTEMBER 
(STUDENTS WILL HAVE TO GO BACK TO SCHOOL IN THE FALL!)

As part of a rash of conspiracy theories about the end of the world 
that seem to be popular these days, some web commentators are now 
suggesting that Comet Elenin - which will pass closest to the Earth on 
Oct. 16th, 2011 - was connected somehow to the recent earthquake in 
Japan and will cause major destruction to our planet in months to 
come. 

Astronomer David Morrison, writing for the "Astronomy Beat" column of 
the Astronomical Society of the Pacific, has examined these claims and 
finds them all without foundation. As a public service, the Society is 
making the updated column available free to all readers at:
