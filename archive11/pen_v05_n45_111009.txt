CHARLES P. "CHUCK" SONETT, 1924-2011

It is with deep sadness that we note yet another loss to our community 
this year with the recent passing of Chuck Sonett. Chuck was the first 
Planetary Science Department head at the University of Arizona, 
succeeding Gerard Kuiper as the second director of LPL. He was 
involved with the very beginning of the US space program, through the 
Apollo program, and was involved with the ESA/NASA Ulysses mission.

discuss potential impacts on the FY12 budget of the NASA Planetary 
Division (the fiscal year begins October 1, 2011, but the federal 
budget is currently under Continuing Resolution).

Invited Speakers include:

Jim Green, Director of the SMD Planetary Science Division
Eric Smith, Deputy Director of the JWST Program Office

[NASA] CONCEPTS FOR THE NEXT NASA X-RAY ASTRONOMY MISSION: CORRECTIONS

"Dear Colleague Letter" has been replaced by the correct "Request for
Information".  Also, the page limit for responses is 10 pages (not 7).

Solicitation number: NNH11ZDA018L
Response Date:  October 28, 2011

NASA is seeking information that can be used to develop concepts that 
meet some or all of the scientific objectives of the International 
X ray Observatory (IXO).  Information being sought includes relevant 
mission concepts, instrument concepts, enabling technologies, or any 
aspect of flight, ground or launch systems architecture.

NASA is seeking information relevant to an X-ray astronomy mission 
concept or mission concepts that will satisfy some or all the 
scientific objectives listed in Table 1.  The RFI also requests 
standalone instrument concepts as well as relevant key enabling 
technologies for such missions or instruments.  Mission concepts 
should range in cost from ~ $300M to $2,000M in FY12 dollars.

[NASA] REQUEST FOR APPLICATIONS FOR X-RAY COMMUNITY SCIENCE TEAM

NASA is requesting letters of application from U.S. scientists to apply 
for membership in the X-ray Community Science Team (CST).  This request 
is open to all U.S. scientists, including individuals planning to 
respond to the Request for Information (RFI).  Letters of application 
are invited from individuals, not groups.

NASA expects to select approximately 10 individuals for membership on 
the X-ray CST and plans to announce its selection by November 3, 2011. 
An initial meeting (by telecon) is tentatively scheduled for the week 
of November 10, 2011.  Prospective applicants need to ensure that they 
will have the necessary time and commitment to support their 
participation in the X-ray CST through the anticipated presentation to 
the CAA in Spring-Summer 2012.  

Replies to this call should be submitted by email only and be received 
by 4:30 PM EST on October 19, 2011.  Please email your letter (with 
subject line "X-ray CST Application") to Dr. Richard Griffiths, NASA 
HQ, at richard.e.griffiths@nasa.gov. Questions may be addressed to 
Dr. Griffiths at the email address provided or at 202-358-1605.

POSTDOCTORAL RESEARCHERS IN LUNAR SCIENCE

The Universities Space Research Association's Lunar and Planetary 
Institute (LPI) invites applications for lunar science and exploration
postdoctoral fellowships.  Opportunities include:

Lunar Surface Geology and Remote Sensing - Using new LRO data; 
integrating it with existing lunar data to evaluate processes 
associated with impact cratering and/or planetary differentiation.  
Experience with orbital remote sensing methods, photometry of lunar 
materials, and photogeology of lunar or lunar-like terrains preferred. 

Experimental and/or Analytical Petrology and Geochemistry - Using 
Apollo and lunar meteorite samples (or synthetic analogues) to evaluate
processes associated with impact cratering and/or planetary 
differentiation.  Experience with electron and ion microprobes, and/or 
LA-ICPMS techniques preferred.

Modeling of Impact Cratering Processes - Using hydrocodes and 
relevant analytical techniques to evaluate different cratering 
processes on the Moon, to model specific crater or basin-forming 
events, and potentially guide future exploration scenarios. 

The successful candidate will be a member of the new LPI-JSC Center 
for Lunar Science and Exploration (http://www.lpi.usra.edu/nlsi/), 
one of the core teams within the NASA Lunar Science Institute. 
           
Further information, including submission requirements are found at:

http://www.lpi.usra.edu

Questions regarding science involved in the position, contact
Dr. David Kring (kring@lpi.usra.edu). 

The Universities Space Research Association is an Equal Opportunity 
Employer.

ANNOUNCEMENT: EUROPA LANDER OPEN FORUM

The Europa Science Definition Team (SDT) has been tasked by NASA 
Headquarters to consider a lander option for Europa.  As part of the 
information gathering effort, the Europa SDT will solicit input from 
the scientific community at large.  A Town Hall meeting consisting of 
presentations and discussion is scheduled for the afternoon 
immediately following the upcoming OPAG meeting in Pasadena, on 
Thursday October 20, from 1:30 to 5:00 pm.  Please see:

http://icpi.nasaprs.com/opag

Details from recent lander design studies will be presented, followed 
by community presentations and open discussion.  Brief presentations 
are solicited relating to topics such as: potential science objectives 
and priorities, instrument techniques, landing environment and sites, 
sample handling, and astrobiological context.

Requests for brief (~5-minute) presentations on relevant topics will 
be accepted until the week of the event.

Interested parties unable to attend in person are encouraged to join 
electronically.  Video conferencing details may be found at the OPAG 
web site:

http://www.lpi.usra.edu/opag/
 
Note that registration for OPAG does not confirm participation in the 
Forum.

Please forward questions or RSVP to Steve Vance (svance@jpl.nasa.gov).

THE NASA POSTDOCTORAL PROGRAM

The next deadline to apply for a NASA Postdoctoral Program (NPP) 
fellowship is November 1, 2011.  These competitive 1-3 year 
appointments advance NASA's missions in space science, earth science, 
aeronautics, space operations, exploration systems, lunar science, and 
astrobiology.

Applicants must have a Ph.D. or equivalent degree in hand before 
beginning the fellowship, but may apply while completing the degree 
requirements. U. S. citizens and foreign nationals who hold Lawful 
Permanent Resident status or who are eligible for J-1 status as a 
Research Scholar may apply.  An H-1B Visa status is not acceptable 
because the NPP is not an employment program.

Stipend rates for Postdoctoral Fellows start at $50,000 per year, 
with moderate supplements for high cost-of-living areas and for 
certain academic specialties. Funds are available for relocation 
expenses, up to a specified limit, and health insurance is available 
through the program. Fellows also receive $8,000 per appointment year
to support travel to conferences, meetings, and other activities that
directly support their research.

Applications for the NASA Postdoctoral Program are accepted three 
times each year: March 1, July 1, and November 1.
