EPSC-DPS EPO SESSIONS

Education & Public Outreach Sessions at the Joint EPSC/DPS Conference
in Nantes, France    
October 3-7, 2011
Abstract Submission Deadline: May 31, 2011

Planetary scientists with interests in Education and Public Outreach 
are invited to submit an abstract for presentation of your work at 
the joint European Planetary Science Congress (EPSC) / AAS Division

http://meetingorganizer.copernicus.org/EPSC-DPS2011/sessionprogramme/OA 

You are invited to submit abstracts for either an oral or a poster 
presentation. 
*** Submitting an abstract for an OEA session does not preclude you 
from submitting a science abstract as well.***

Questions about the OEA sessions can be directed to Lou Mayo 
(Louis.A.Mayo@nasa.gov).

EPSC-DPS SESSION: GP1. GIANT PLANET ATMOSPHERES AND INTERIORS

Dear colleagues, 

We would like to invite you to contribute to the Giant Planets 
sessions of the European Planetary Science Congress and Division of 
Planetary Sciences (EPSC-DPS) Joint Meeting 2011 to be held in Nantes,
France, October 3rd-7th 2011 - Deadline:  May 31st.

Recent observations of the gas and ice giants have revealed complex 
evolving atmospheric systems, from short term variability (impacts on 
Jupiter, mid-latitude storms on Saturn, discrete features on Uranus 
and Neptune), medium-term changes (the life cycle of Jupiter's South 
Equatorial Belt, seasonal storms on Saturn) and seasonally-induced 
hemispheric asymmetries and equator-to-pole contrasts on Saturn, 
Uranus and Neptune. Temporal variability within the weather layer 
may provide key diagnostics of processes occurring in regions 
inaccessible to remote sensing, within the deep troposphere and 
planetary interior. Abstracts concerning the present state of the 
neutral atmospheres (dynamics, chemistry and vertical structure); 
their temporal evolution and coupling to the planetary interior 
(internal structure, convection and interaction with the atmosphere) 
are particularly welcome, along with a discussion of future priorities 
for the exploration of giant planet atmospheres from ground- and 
space-based facilities.

For general information on the conference and online abstract
submission (deadline May 31, 2011), please visit the web site: 

http://meetings.copernicus.org/epsc-dps2011/home.html 

Please forward this email to any colleagues who may be interested 
in contributing to this session, and we look forward to seeing you 
in Nantes!

Leigh Fletcher, Glenn Orton, Patrick Irwin and Tristan Guillot

EPSC-DPS SESSION: GP3. TITAN'S INTERIOR, SURFACE, AND ATMOSPHERE AND 
(EX)CHANGES THEREIN
   
Titan is the only moon in the solar system with a dense atmosphere and 
the only place besides Earth with stable liquids at its surface. This 
session focuses on the exchange processes between the interior and the 
atmosphere and how these processes have shaped Titan's surface. The 
session welcomes abstracts describing observations, laboratory 
experiments and numerical simulations.

Conveners: A. Coustenis, C. Sotin, E. Turtle

EPSC-DPS SESSION: GP4/AB6. TITAN AS A PREBIOTIC CHEMICAL SYSTEM 

The scope of this session is the past, present and future of Titan. 
This session will examine Titan as a system with the goal of trying to
better understand the chemistry and potential for a prebiotic world. 
There are many questions to address. How did Titan form? What was the
origin of its atmosphere? What is the source of methane and what is the 
timing of its outgassing to the surface? How much methane is present 
today in the surface-atmosphere system of Titan? How thick are the 
deposits of organic materials, where are they in the Titan crust, and 
what is the extent of their further chemistry beyond stratospheric 
photochemistry toward complex organics of prebiotic interest? How has 
organic chemistry evolved over time on the surface of Titan, and is the 
evolution progressive or cyclic? Was Titan's surface much warmer in
the past and what will conditions be like when the Sun becomes a red
giant? What are the next appropriate steps in the exploration of Titan 
in terms of mission design and instrument techniques?

Conveners: P. Beauchamp, A. Coustenis, J. I. Lunine

USGS SHOEMAKER FELLOWSHIP ANNOUNCEMENT

The U.S. Geological Survey Astrogeology Science Center in Flagstaff, 
Arizona, has a two-year full-time research position now posted online. 
The position is at the GS-12 grade level (comparable to a post-doctoral
researcher in academia). Funded by the NASA Planetary Geology and 
Geophysics (PGG) Program, this position is generally known as the 
NASA 'Shoemaker Fellow' at USGS in honor of Dr. Eugene Shoemaker. 
The selected Fellow will work at the Astrogeology Science Center in
Flagstaff on a variety of research projects in planetary science. 
The position is managed and supervised by the Astrogeology Science 
Center. The application opportunity will be open from 
5/11/11 to 6/06/11.

To learn more or to apply, go to USAJOBS: 

http://www.usajobs.gov 

and view Job Announcement Number PAC-2011-0413 for a position as 
Geologist, Geophysicist, or Physical Scientist. Applicants must apply

[NASA] AIST POTENTIAL BIDDERS CONFERENCE 

The Advanced Information System Technology (AIST) program is designed 
to bring information system technologies to a Technology Readiness 
Level (TRL) that allows integration into existing or future technology/
science research and development programs, or infusion into existing 
or planned subsystems/systems to enable timely and affordable delivery 
of information to users. 

The AIST Capabilities and Needs Matrix is documented at:

http://esto.nasa.gov/AIST-ROSES

along with the TRL definitions and information about former AIST 
solicitations for technology.

For ROSES-2011, the AIST solicitation features a new collaboration 
initiative with the NASA Applied Sciences Program (ASP) to promote the 
integration of technical capabilities enabled by AIST development 
for use by selected decision support or end user applications. 
Section 1.4 describes the technology infusion option for Earth science 
applications. 

The text of the AIST solicitation can be found at: 

http://tinyurl.com/43j7e2l 

A Potential Bidders Conference for AIST will be held on Thursday, 
May 26, 2011 at 13:00 EDT / 10:00 PDT to address questions regarding 
the solicitation. Inquiries in advance, send email to 
aistquestions@nasaprs.com. The conference will be entirely virtual, 
conducted via WebEx connectivity. Instructions for participating in the
conference will be posted on the ESTO web site:

http://esto.nasa.gov

on or before May 26.
