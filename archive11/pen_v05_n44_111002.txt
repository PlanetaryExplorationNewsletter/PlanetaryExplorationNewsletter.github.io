NEW RESOURCES FOR THOSE WHO TEACH ASTRONOMY

As the fall semester or quarter begins, here are a few new educational
resources from the nonprofit Astronomical Society of the Pacific that 
may help you if you are teaching or explaining astronomy:

1. Frank Drake Tells How He Came Up with the Drake Equation:

http://www.astrosociety.org/drake/

2. A New Classroom Activity - How High Up is Space:

http://www.astrosociety.org/education/activities/I11_How_High_Space.pdf

3. An "Astronomy Behind the Headlines" podcast on "Science from the 
Moon" (on current and future Moon missions, with guest Dr. Jack Burns,
University of Colorado):

http://astrosociety.org/abh/index.html

4. An Astronomer Looks at Astrology (an information sheet for both 
students and instructors):

http://www.astrosociety.org/astrology.pdf

5. A new issue of "The Universe in the Classroom" with information 
and activities for the 2012 Transit of Venus:

http://www.astrosociety.org/education/publications/tnl/78/78.html

6. The Universe at Your Fingertips 2.0 
(a DVD-ROM with 133 hands-on classroom activities, and lots of 
articles, resources, images, and how-to videos for teaching astronomy 
at many levels and in many settings):

THE NASA POSTDOCTORAL PROGRAM

The next deadline to apply for a NASA Postdoctoral Program (NPP) 
fellowship is November 1, 2011.  These competitive 1-3 year 
appointments advance NASA's missions in space science, earth science, 
aeronautics, space operations, exploration systems, lunar science, and 
astrobiology.

Applicants must have a Ph.D. or equivalent degree in hand before 
beginning the fellowship, but may apply while completing the degree 
requirements. U. S. citizens and foreign nationals who hold Lawful 
Permanent Resident status or who are eligible for J-1 status as a 
Research Scholar may apply.  An H-1B Visa status is not acceptable 
because the NPP is not an employment program.

Stipend rates for Postdoctoral Fellows start at $50,000 per year, 
with moderate supplements for high cost-of-living areas and for 
certain academic specialties. Funds are available for relocation 
expenses, up to a specified limit, and health insurance is available 
through the program. Fellows also receive $8,000 per appointment year
to support travel to conferences, meetings, and other activities that
directly support their research.

Applications for the NASA Postdoctoral Program are accepted three 
times each year: March 1, July 1, and November 1.

POSTDOCTORAL RESEARCHER IN PETROLOGY OF PLANETARY MATERIALS

The Lunar and Planetary Institute (LPI), part of the Universities 
Space Research Association, invites applications for a postdoctoral 
fellowship in the petrology of planetary materials.

The successful candidate will work with Dr. Allan Treiman in NASA-
funded efforts, focusing on planetary crusts and magmas, and their 
volatiles constituents; target materials include lunar highlands rocks, 
Martian meteorites, and terrestrial analogs.  These efforts focus on 
planetary samples, starting with analyses by optical microscopy and 
electron microprobe; other instruments are available at nearby Johnson 
Space Center or with external collaborators.  The candidate will be 
encouraged to design and conduct their own research in planetary 
science, propose for external funding, participate in grant review 
panels and analysis groups, and become involved with spacecraft 
missions.

The successful candidate will have a recent Ph.D. in petrology or 
geochemistry; experience with planetary materials is helpful, but 
not required.  The position would be for two years, with possible 
extension to a third year.  Review of candidates will begin on 
November 15, 2011, with a hiring decision as soon as possible 
thereafter. Further information can be found on our website:

Employer.

POSTDOCTORAL RESEARCHERS IN LUNAR SCIENCE

The Universities Space Research Association's Lunar and Planetary 
Institute (LPI) invites applications for lunar science and exploration
postdoctoral fellowships.  Opportunities include:

Lunar Surface Geology and Remote Sensing - Using new LRO data; 
integrating it with existing lunar data to evaluate processes 
associated with impact cratering and/or planetary differentiation.  
Experience with orbital remote sensing methods, photometry of lunar 
materials, and photogeology of lunar or lunar-like terrains preferred. 

Experimental and/or Analytical Petrology and Geochemistry - Using 
Apollo and lunar meteorite samples (or synthetic analogues) to evaluate
processes associated with impact cratering and/or planetary 
differentiation.  Experience with electron and ion microprobes, and/or 
LA-ICPMS techniques preferred.

Modeling of Impact Cratering Processes - Using hydrocodes and 
relevant analytical techniques to evaluate different cratering 
processes on the Moon, to model specific crater or basin-forming 
events, and potentially guide future exploration scenarios. 

The successful candidate will be a member of the new LPI-JSC Center 
for Lunar Science and Exploration (http://www.lpi.usra.edu/nlsi/), 
one of the core teams within the NASA Lunar Science Institute. 
           
Further information, including submission requirements are found at:

GERALD A. SOFFEN MEMORIAL FUND TRAVEL GRANT OPPORTUNITY

The Gerald A. Soffen Memorial Fund is pleased to announce the final 
2011 Travel Grant application opportunity for undergraduate and 
graduate students pursuing studies in fields of space science and 
engineering. 

The Travel Grants, in the amount of $500, enable student recipients 
to attend professional meetings to present their research. The Fall 
2011 Travel Grant application deadline is October 15, 2011.

Jerry Soffen, a biologist by training, led a distinguished career in 
NASA, including serving as the Project Scientist for Viking and as an
architect for the NASA Astrobiology Institute. The Travel Grant 
continues Jerry's dedication to educating and involving future 
generations in space science and engineering pursuits. The electronic 
application materials and instructions are accessible through the 
Soffen Fund website:

http://nasa-academy.org/soffen/travelgrant/

Questions regarding the application or application process may be 
sent to: travelgrant@nasa-academy.org

OUTER PLANETS ASSESSMENT GROUP MEETING, 19-20 OCTOBER 2011

The meeting will take place at the Westin Pasadena, and the agenda can 
be found at http://www.lpi.usra.edu/opag, along with information 
regarding hotel and other logistics at:

http://icpi.nasaprs.com/opag

Potential attendees are kindly asked to go to:

http://icpi.nasaprs.com/opag 

and click on the invitation link and RSVP for attendance (this will 
assist our meeting planners).

NASA has entered an era of strong fiscal constraints, and is struggling
to maintain its commitments to missions in development and in flight. 
Community input will be vital in preserving robust Outer Planets 
Exploration. This OPAG meeting accordingly will focus on threats to 
the Cassini Solstice mission, implementation of the Planetary Science 
Decadal Survey, an update on European plans, and studies of potential 
missions to Europa.

Bill McKinnon, OPAG Chair
