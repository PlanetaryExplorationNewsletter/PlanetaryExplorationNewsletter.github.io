AOGS SESSION: OUTER PLANETS AND ICY WORLDS (PS.06)

Annual Meeting of the AOGS (Asia-Oceania Geosciences Society)
Taipei, Taiwan August 8-12, 2011

http://www.asiaoceania.org/aogs2011/public.asp?page=home.htm

This session will be devoted to outer planet satellites, including Io 
and icy worlds large (e.g. Titan) and small (e.g. Enceladus), rings 
and icy dwarf planets. The session will include solicited, contributed, 
and poster presentations addressing observational, laboratory, and 
theoretical studies relevant to past, ongoing, and future missions. 
Relevant topics include:
(1) interior structure, composition and thermal evolution,
(2) surface geology and composition,
(3) composition and dynamics of neutral atmospheres
(4) orbital dynamics and satellite interactions,
(5) structure and dynamics of planetary rings,
(6) physical properties of ring particles and small satellites of 
outer planet satellites.

http://www.asiaoceania.org/aogs2011/public.asp?page=home.htm

This session invites solicited, contributed, and poster presentations

[NASA] AVAILABILITY FOR SUMMER OF INNOVATION (SOI) COMPETITIVE GRANTS 
PEER REVIEW

NASA Research and Education Support Services (NRESS) is seeking persons 
to evaluate proposals submitted in response to the NASA Cooperative 
Agreement Notice (CAN) titled, "2011 Summer of Innovation Project". 
NASA is seeking reviewers with various backgrounds and professional 
affiliation including Pre-K through 12 teachers and principals, college 
and university educators, researchers and evaluators, social 
entrepreneurs, strategy consultants, grant makers and managers, and 
others with education expertise.

The Summer of Innovation is a solicitation-driven project that 
supports student interest in STEM by strengthening the capacity of 
community- and school-based organizations that inspire and engage 
middle school students in STEM content during the summer. SoI then 
continues to support follow-on and extended learning efforts designed 
to keep students involved in NASA-themed STEM activities during the
academic year.

For details please visit:

http://nspires.nasaprs.com 
or 
http://www.grants.gov/

The review period is scheduled for March 1-8, 2011. 

If you would like to be a reviewer, please e-mail 
NASASOIP2011@nasaprs.com by COB February 18, 2011.  
Include contact information, resume/vita, and a summary of your

DAWN SCIENCE TEAM - EDUCATION AND PUBLIC OUTREACH LIAISON CALL FOR 
APPLICATIONS

The Dawn project has an immediate opening for an EPO-Science Team 
liaison who will coordinate with the Dawn Science and EPO Teams to 
engage the Public in the Dawn Mission.  The incumbent requires a PhD 
in planetary science with working knowledge of small solar system 
bodies strongly preferred.  The funding available for FY11 activities 
is approximately $33K which is expected to cover both salary, travel 
and other expenses associated with the position. The available funding 
in following years will be about $43K.  

Interested individuals should send an email to margie@igpp.ucla.edu 
who will  supply a statement of work for the position  Applicants 
should then provide a detailed budget and resume that clearly outlines 
their experience that prepares them for these responsibilities as well 
as their vision for public outreach while Dawn orbits Vesta beginning 
in July 2011 and cruises to its eventual rendezvous with Ceres in 2015. 

The incumbent is expected to have no ties with any Dawn investigation. 
The incumbent does not gain data analysis or publication rights through 
this position. All applications received by February 14, 2011 will be 
considered.

MARS EXPRESS OMEGA DATA RELEASE

New data has been released in the ESA Planetary Science Archive from 
the Mars Express OMEGA instrument. Data from the entire second mission 
extension is now available in the data set:

MEX-M-OMEGA-2-EDR-FLIGHT-EXT2-V1.0

This covers the period from November 2007 until January 2010.

The new data can be accessed via the standard PSA user interfaces 
available from our website:

RESOURCES FOR SKEPTICAL EXAMINATION OF ASTROLOGY FROM THE ASTRONOMICAL 
SOCIETY OF THE PACIFIC

In light of the recent media interest into problems with astrology and 
the fact that the astrological signs and astronomical constellations 
no longer line up, the non-profit Astronomical Society of the Pacific
has updated its long-popular article examining astrology from an 
astronomical perspective and is making it available on the Web at:

http://www.astrosociety.org/astrology.pdf

(It includes the suggestion of a new "science" of jetology --
where the position of jumbo jets at the time a person is born 
determines his or her destiny and love life -- which many educators 
have found useful over the years.)

There is also a resource guide for looking at a wide
range of astronomical pseudo-science at:

41ST SAAS-FEE ADVANCED COURSE "FROM PLANETS TO LIFE"

From the Swiss Society for Astrophysics and Astronomy
41st Saas-Fee Advanced Course "From Planets to Life"

This astrobiology course consists of 28 lectures organized in three 
parts as follow:

- Earth geology and climatology history
   Prof. James Kasting (Pennsylvania State University)
- Origin and critical steps of life development on Earth
   Prof. John Baross (University of Washington)

In addition to the formal course, the setting of this event provides 
ample time for informal discussions during the meals and other social 
events.

We are approaching our maximum hosting capacity, however, we can 
still accommodate for about a dozen additional participants.

The regular registration deadline is JANUARY 28th, 2011. After this 
date the registration fee will raise from CHF450.- to CHF500.-.

JAPAN GEOSCIENCE UNION INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM 2011:
SESSION ON FUTURE EXPLORATION OF THE JUPITER AND SATURN SYSTEMS

We would like to invite you to attend and contribute to the Japan 
Geoscience Union International Symposium 2011 (JpGU 2011), held in 
Chiba-city, Japan, 22-27 May 2011, See:

http://www.jpgu.org/meeting_e/index.htm

Pay attention particularly to session: P-PS01: "Future explorations 
of Jupiter and Saturn system"

Giant planets are the most prominent representative bodies not only 
in the solar system but also in other extrasolar systems. The origin of 
the Jovian planets and the icy moons are inseparable and thus their 
origin, internal structure, composition, etc. will be comprehensively 
discussed. In front of the future mission Era, we'd like to promote the 
study of Jovian planets and their satellites. Also, progress in 
developing a solar sail mission to observe Jupiter system and Trojan 
asteroids will be discussed.

Important Dates:
 Feb, 4 12:00 JST Deadline of Abstract submission
 May, 9 Pre-JpGU Meeting registration closes

We would appreciate forwarding this session announcement to interested
colleagues and look forward to seeing you in Chiba, Japan.
