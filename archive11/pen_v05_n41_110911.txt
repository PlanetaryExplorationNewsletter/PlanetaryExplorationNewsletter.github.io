NICHOLAS M. SHORT (July 18, 1927 - June 12, 2011)
 
Nicholas M. Short helped establish the fields of shock metamorphism 
and meteorite impact crater studies. He made contributions to lunar 
sample investigations and remote sensing in terrestrial geology. Nick 
died in Bowie, MD, after a long battle with cancer. 
 
Nick received his Ph.D. in geochemistry in 1958 from MIT and at
the Lawrence Livermore Laboratory studied the unique 
deformation effects created in rocks and minerals by the intense 
shock waves produced by nuclear and chemical explosions.  He helped 
establish that the extreme environments of nuclear explosions were 
close to those of natural meteorite impact events, with effects that 
provide indicators of ancient impact events. He co-edited (with Bevan 
French) Shock Metamorphism of Natural Materials (1968) ("The Green 
Bible"), which remains a fundamental text in the field.  He used 
remote-sensing data for terrestrial geological and environmental 
studies and developed the still-active NASA Remote Sensing Tutorial 
Web site (http://rst.gsfc.nasa.gov). Retiring from Goddard in 1988, 
and joining Bloomsburg University, he continued to work on remote 
sensing and actively expanded and updated the Tutorial until just 
shortly before his death. 

His keenly inquiring mind and enthusiasm will be missed.

ANGIOLETTA CORADINI, 1946-2011

Angioletta Coradini, one of the world-recognized leading experts in 
Planetary Sciences, with varied interests ranging from minor bodies to 
outer planets, and theory on the formation of our Solar system passed 
away on September 4, 2011. She started her scientific career in 1969 
with her PhD thesis at the Rome University "La Sapienza" on the origin 
of glassy particles found in lunar soils.  During the eighties she 
collaborated  with the JPL Team who developed the TIMS (Thermal 
Infrared Mass Spectroscope), gaining experience that allowed her to 
lead the Italian team for the Cassini VIMS Spectrometer visual channel. 
She gained further experience in the management of space experiments, 
starting with the PI-ship of VIRTIS on Rosetta, and continuing with 
other experiments including VIR on DAWN, now in orbit around Vesta, 
JIRAM on the Juno mission en route to Jupiter, the infrared 
spectrometers on Venus Express, Bepi Colombo, and many other projects.
In recognition of her significant contributions to the planetary 
sciences she received many honors and awards. Angioletta will be deeply 
missed and remembered by her family, colleagues and friends.

POSTDOCTORAL RESEARCHER: PETROLOGY OF PLANETARY MATERIALS

The Lunar and Planetary Institute (LPI), part of the Universities 
Space Research Association, invites applications for a postdoctoral 
fellowship in the petrology of planetary materials. The successful 
candidate will work with Dr. Allan Treiman in NASA-funded efforts, 
focusing on planetary crusts and magmas, and their volatile 
constituents; target materials include lunar highlands rocks, Martian 
meteorites, and terrestrial analogs.  These efforts focus on planetary 
samples, starting with analyses by optical microscopy and electron 
microprobe; other instruments are available at nearby Johnson Space 
Center or with external collaborators.  The candidate will be 
encouraged to design and conduct their own research in planetary 
science, propose for external funding, participate in grant review 
panels and analysis groups, and become involved with spacecraft 
missions.

The successful candidate will have a recent Ph.D. in petrology or 
geochemistry; experience with planetary materials is helpful, but 
not required.  The position would be for two years, with possible 
extension to a third year.  Review of candidates will begin on 
November 15, 2011, with a hiring decision as soon as possible 
thereafter. Further information can be found on our website:

POSTDOCTORAL RESEARCHERS IN LUNAR SCIENCE

The Universities Space Research Association's Lunar and Planetary 
Institute (LPI) invites applications for lunar science and exploration 
postdoctoral fellowships.  Opportunities include:

Lunar Surface Geology and Remote Sensing - Using new LRO data; 
integrating it with existing lunar data to evaluate processes 
associated with impact cratering and/or planetary differentiation.  
Experience with orbital remote sensing methods, photometry of lunar 
materials, and photogeology of lunar or lunar-like terrains preferred. 

Experimental and/or Analytical Petrology and Geochemistry - Using 
Apollo and lunar meteorite samples (or synthetic analogues) to 
evaluate processes associated with impact cratering and/or planetary 
differentiation.  Experience with electron and ion microprobes, 
and/or LA-ICPMS techniques preferred.

Modeling of Impact Cratering Processes - Using hydrocodes and 
relevant analytical techniques to evaluate different cratering 
processes on the Moon, to model specific crater or basin-forming 
events, and potentially guide future exploration scenarios. 

The successful candidate will be a member of the new LPI-JSC Center 
for Lunar Science and Exploration (http://www.lpi.usra.edu/nlsi/), 
one of the core teams within the NASA Lunar Science Institute.

NASA POSTDOCTORAL FELLOWSHIPS
 
The next deadline to apply for a NASA Postdoctoral Program (NPP) 
fellowship is November 1, 2011.  These competitive one- to three-year 
appointments advance NASA's missions in space science, earth science, 
aeronautics, space operations, exploration systems, lunar science, and 
astrobiology.
 
Applicants must have a Ph.D. or equivalent degree in hand before 
beginning the fellowship, but may apply while completing the degree 
requirements. U. S. citizens and foreign nationals who hold Lawful 
Permanent Resident status or who are eligible for J-1 status as a 
Research Scholar may apply.  An H-1B Visa status is not acceptable 
because the NPP is not an employment program.
 
Stipend rates for Postdoctoral Fellows start at $50,000 per year, with 
moderate supplements for high cost-of-living areas and for certain 
academic specialties. Funds are available for relocation expenses, up 
to a specified limit, and health insurance is available through the 
program. Fellows also receive $8,000 per appointment year to support 
travel to conferences, meetings, and other activities that directly 
support their research.

SCIENCE CAFE SPEAKERS NEEDED FOR PBS PROGRAM "FINDING LIFE BEYOND 
EARTH"

A new NOVA program, Finding Life Beyond Earth, will premier Wednesday, 
October 19th, at 9pm on PBS.  It focuses on a central theme in 
Astrobiology, Are we alone?, as it explores the latest discoveries 
changing how we think about the potential for life in our solar 
system.
 
As part of a targeted outreach campaign, NOVA is providing resources 
for Science Cafe organizers to host themed cafes around the countryâ€”
and they need your help as a potential cafe speaker!

NOVA is currently compiling a list of scientists and researchers who 
would like to speak at these cafes. This speaker list will be made 
available to cafe organizers to assist them in their planning. 
Please consider registering for the Finding Life Beyond Earth Cafe 
Speaker List at:

OUTER PLANETS ASSESSMENT GROUP MEETING,  19-20 Oct 2011

The REVISED agenda for the October 19-20, 2011, OPAG meeting has been 
posted. Please see:
 
http://www.lpi.usra.edu/opag

The meeting will take place at the Westin Pasadena, and information 
regarding hotel and other logistics is also linked. Please note that 
room availability outside of the OPAG meeting time block is limited 
due to numerous conventions in the Los Angeles area, so early booking 
is advised if you wish to stay later or arrive earlier.

NASA is now entering an era of strong fiscal constraints.  Community 
input will be vital in preserving robust Outer Planets Exploration. 
This OPAG meeting accordingly will focus on threats to the Cassini 
Solstice mission, implementation of the Planetary Science Decadal 
Survey, an update on European plans, and studies of potential missions 
to Europa.

Please also note that the upcoming due date for proposals to the NASA 
Outer Planets Research (OPR) Program has been changed to 
November 4, 2011.
