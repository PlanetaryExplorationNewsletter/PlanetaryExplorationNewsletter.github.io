[NASA] PLANETARY SCIENCE SUBCOMMITTEE MEETING FOR NOVEMBER 2-3, 2011 IS
CANCELLED

From Jim Green, Director, Planetary Science Division, and 
Jonathan Rall, Executive Secretary, Planetary Science Subcommittee

Due to the unexpected and tragic loss of Ron Greeley, Chair of the 
Planetary Science Subcommittee (PSS), the PSS meeting scheduled for 
November 2-3 at NASA Headquarters has been canceled. The meeting will 
be rescheduled for a later date and notice of that new date will be 
published in the Federal Register. 

We apologize for any inconvenience due to these extraordinary 
circumstances but felt that the meeting should be canceled since it 
would likely conflict with Ron's funeral or memorial service. We 
anticipate that many in the planetary science community will pay their 
respects to Ron, a pillar of planetary science, and celebrate his 
incredible journey.
