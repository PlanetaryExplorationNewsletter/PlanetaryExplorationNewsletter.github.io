POSTDOCTORAL RESEARCHERS IN LUNAR SCIENCE

The Universities Space Research Association's Lunar and Planetary 
Institute (LPI) invites applications for lunar science and exploration 
postdoctoral fellowships.  Opportunities include:

Lunar Surface Geology and Remote Sensing - Using new LRO data; 
integrating it with existing lunar data to evaluate processes 
associated with impact cratering and/or planetary differentiation.  
Experience with orbital remote sensing methods, photometry of lunar 
materials, and photogeology of lunar or lunar-like terrains preferred. 

Experimental and/or Analytical Petrology and Geochemistry - Using 
Apollo and lunar meteorite samples (or synthetic analogues) to 
evaluate processes associated with impact cratering and/or planetary 
differentiation.  Experience with electron and ion microprobes, 
and/or LA-ICPMS techniques preferred.

Modeling of Impact Cratering Processes - Using hydrocodes and 
relevant analytical techniques to evaluate different cratering 
processes on the Moon, to model specific crater or basin-forming 
events, and potentially guide future exploration scenarios. 

The successful candidate will be a member of the new LPI-JSC Center 
for Lunar Science and Exploration (http://www.lpi.usra.edu/nlsi/), 
one of the core teams within the NASA Lunar Science Institute.  
            
Further information, including submission requirements are found at: 

http://www.lpi.usra.edu  

Questions regarding science involved in the position, contact 
Dr. David Kring (kring@lpi.usra.edu).

Employer.

POSTDOCTORAL RESEARCHER: PETROLOGY OF PLANETARY MATERIALS

The Lunar and Planetary Institute (LPI), part of the Universities 
Space Research Association, invites applications for a postdoctoral 
fellowship in the petrology of planetary materials. The successful 
candidate will work with Dr. Allan Treiman in NASA-funded efforts, 
focusing on planetary crusts and magmas, and their volatile 
constituents; target materials include lunar highlands rocks, Martian 
meteorites, and terrestrial analogs.  These efforts focus on planetary 
samples, starting with analyses by optical microscopy and electron 
microprobe; other instruments are available at nearby Johnson Space 
Center or with external collaborators.  The candidate will be 
encouraged to design and conduct their own research in planetary 
science, propose for external funding, participate in grant review 
panels and analysis groups, and become involved with spacecraft 
missions.

The successful candidate will have a recent Ph.D. in petrology or 
geochemistry; experience with planetary materials is helpful, but 
not required.  The position would be for two years, with possible 
extension to a third year.  Review of candidates will begin on 
November 15, 2011, with a hiring decision as soon as possible 
thereafter. Further information can be found on our website:

NASA POSTDOCTORAL FELLOWSHIPS
 
The next deadline to apply for a NASA Postdoctoral Program (NPP) 
fellowship is November 1, 2011.  These competitive one- to three-year 
appointments advance NASA's missions in space science, earth science, 
aeronautics, space operations, exploration systems, lunar science, and 
astrobiology.
 
Applicants must have a Ph.D. or equivalent degree in hand before 
beginning the fellowship, but may apply while completing the degree 
requirements. U. S. citizens and foreign nationals who hold Lawful 
Permanent Resident status or who are eligible for J-1 status as a 
Research Scholar may apply.  An H-1B Visa status is not acceptable 
because the NPP is not an employment program.
 
Stipend rates for Postdoctoral Fellows start at $50,000 per year, with 
moderate supplements for high cost-of-living areas and for certain 
academic specialties. Funds are available for relocation expenses, up 
to a specified limit, and health insurance is available through the 
program. Fellows also receive $8,000 per appointment year to support 
travel to conferences, meetings, and other activities that directly 
support their research.

[NASA] UPCOMING PROPOSAL WRITING WORKSHOP

Most planetary scientists depend on competitive NASA research grants 
to fund their work, and each year NASA receives thousands of proposals 
and selects only about one third of them. How will you fare in this 
competition?  Do you know how to write a NASA proposal?  Do you know 
where to submit it?  Do you know the lessons your competitors have 
gleaned after years of writing their own proposals?

If you are unsure of the answers to any of these questions please plan 
on attending the upcoming Proposal Writing Workshop.  The workshop is 
sponsored by the Solar Systems Exploration Division at NASA GSFC and 
will be given by Curt Niebur, a program scientist in the Planetary 
Science Division at NASA Headquarters. The workshop is open to all and 
will focus on understanding NASA's research programs, including 
information on how to write a research proposal, where to apply for 
funding, and pathways for participation on missions.

Workshop Details:
Where: NASA GSFC Visitor Center
When: August 22nd, 9 AM - 12 PM
Directions can be found at:
