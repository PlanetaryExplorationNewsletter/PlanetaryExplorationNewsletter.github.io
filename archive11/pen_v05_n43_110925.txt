MICHAEL J. DRAKE, 1946-2011

It is with deep sadness that we note the loss of Mike Drake this past 
week. Chair of the University of Arizona Department of Planetary 
Science and Head of the Lunar and Planetary Laboratory, Mike was the 
PI of the recently selected OSIRIS Rex mission and a long time leader 
of the planetary community and substantial contributor to our science. 
He will be very much missed.

A memorial and opportunity to post remembrances is posted at:

POSTDOCTORAL RESEARCHERS IN LUNAR SCIENCE

The Universities Space Research Association's Lunar and Planetary 
Institute (LPI) invites applications for lunar science and exploration 
postdoctoral fellowships.  Opportunities include:

Lunar Surface Geology and Remote Sensing - Using new LRO data; 
integrating it with existing lunar data to evaluate processes 
associated with impact cratering and/or planetary differentiation.  
Experience with orbital remote sensing methods, photometry of lunar 
materials, and photogeology of lunar or lunar-like terrains preferred.  

Experimental and/or Analytical Petrology and Geochemistry - Using 
Apollo and lunar meteorite samples (or synthetic analogues) to evaluate 
processes associated with impact cratering and/or planetary 
differentiation.  Experience with electron and ion microprobes, and/or 
LA-ICPMS techniques preferred.

Modeling of Impact Cratering Processes - Using hydrocodes and relevant 
analytical techniques to evaluate different cratering processes on the 
Moon, to model specific crater or basin-forming events, and 
potentially guide future exploration scenarios.  

The successful candidate will be a member of the new LPI-JSC Center for 
Lunar Science and Exploration (http://www.lpi.usra.edu/nlsi/), one of 
the core teams within the NASA Lunar Science Institute.

POSTDOCTORAL RESEARCHER: PETROLOGY OF PLANETARY MATERIALS

The Lunar and Planetary Institute (LPI), part of the Universities 
Space Research Association, invites applications for a postdoctoral 
fellowship in the petrology of planetary materials. 

The successful candidate will work with Dr. Allan Treiman in 
NASA-funded efforts, focusing on planetary crusts and magmas, and 
their volatiles constituents; target materials include lunar highlands 
rocks, Martian meteorites, and terrestrial analogs.  These efforts 
focus on planetary samples, starting with analyses by optical 
microscopy and electron microprobe; other instruments are available at 
nearby Johnson Space Center or with external collaborators.  The 
candidate will be encouraged to design and conduct their own research 
in planetary science, propose for external funding, participate in 
grant review panels and analysis groups, and become involved with 
spacecraft missions.

The successful candidate will have a recent Ph.D. in petrology or 
geochemistry; experience with planetary materials is helpful, but 
not required.  The position would be for two years, with possible 
extension to a third year.  Review of candidates will begin on 
November 15, 2011, with a hiring decision as soon as possible 
thereafter. Further information can be found on our website:

NOMINATIONS INVITED FOR 2012 ASP AWARDS

The Astronomical Society of the Pacific Invites Nominations for the 
Society's 2012 Awards.

The Astronomical Society of the Pacific (ASP) is now accepting 
nominations for the Society's 2012 awards honoring excellence in 
astronomy and space science research, technology, education, and public 
outreach.

Recipients receive a cash award and engraved plaque, as well as travel
and lodging to accept the award at the Society's 124th annual meeting. 
The nominations deadline is December 15, 2011.  Submission guidelines, 
lists of past recipients and additional information can be found at:

http://www.astrosociety.org/membership/awards/awards.html

To make inquiries or received additional information, please contact 
Albert Silva at 415.337.1100 x 100 or asilva@astrosociety.org.

THE NASA POSTDOCTORAL PROGRAM

The next deadline to apply for a NASA Postdoctoral Program (NPP) 
fellowship is November 1, 2011.  These competitive one- to three-year 
appointments advance NASA's missions in space science, earth science, 
aeronautics, space operations, exploration systems, lunar science, and 
astrobiology.

Applicants must have a Ph.D. or equivalent degree in hand before 
beginning the fellowship, but may apply while completing the degree 
requirements. U. S. citizens and foreign nationals who hold Lawful 
Permanent Resident status or who are eligible for J-1 status as a 
Research Scholar may apply.  An H-1B Visa status is not acceptable 
because the NPP is not an employment program.

Stipend rates for Postdoctoral Fellows start at $50,000 per year, 
with moderate supplements for high cost-of-living areas and for 
certain academic specialties. Funds are available for relocation 
expenses, up to a specified limit, and health insurance is available 
through the program. Fellows also receive $8,000 per appointment year 
to support travel to conferences, meetings, and other activities that 
directly support their research.

Applications for the NASA Postdoctoral Program are accepted three 
times each year: March 1, July 1, and November 1.
