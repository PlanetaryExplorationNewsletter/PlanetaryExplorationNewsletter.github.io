EDITOR NOTE: NEW URL FOR NASA PLANETARY SCIENCE SUBCOMMITTEE TELECON

It has come to our attention that the URL distributed in last Sunday's
PEN for participating in tomorrow's PSS telecon to discuss the 
impact of JWST on the planetary budget does not work. The following 
(wrapped) URL links to the information you need to call in:

http://www.federalregister.gov/articles/2011/09/20/2011-24129
/nasa-advisory-council-science-committee-planetary-science
-subcommittee-meeting

The time of the telecon is:

Thursday, October 13, 2011, 2-4 PM Eastern. 

You are encouraged to participate.

The Editors
