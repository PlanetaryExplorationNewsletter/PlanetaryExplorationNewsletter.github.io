LYNN MARGULIS, 1938-2011
 
Lynn Margulis passed away on November 22, 2011, at her home, in 
Amherst, Massachussetts, aged 73. She was born in Chicago and enrolled 
at the University of Chicago when she was 14. Lynn was a renowned 
biologist and University Professor in the Department of Geosciences at 
the University of Massachusetts, whose faculty Margulis joined in 1988. 
Prior to that she taught at the University of Boston for 22 years. She 
is best known for her theory on the origin of eukaryotic organelles, 
and her contributions to the endosymbiotic theory. She is also 
associated with the Gaia hypothesis, based on an idea developed by the
English environmental scientist James Lovelock.

The author of "Symbiotic Planet: A New Look at Evolution" penned 
hundreds of research papers and many books during her illustrious 
career. She taught classes in environmental evolution for nearly 40 
years. Lynn, who was once married to astronomer Carl Sagan and then to 
chemist Thomas Margulis, was elected to the National Academy of Arts 
and Sciences in 1983 and received the National Medal of Science in 
1999. She is survived by her four children and nine grandchildren.

CHARLES KOWAL, 1940-2011

Charles T. Kowall died November 28, 2011, after a long battle with 
cancer. He was noted for his discovery of the unusual asteroid/comet 
2060 Chiron, the first of the Centaurs. He also discovered two moons of 
Jupiter (Leda and Themisto), a number of asteroids as well as comets. 
For his discoveries, Kowal was awarded the James Craig Watson Medal 
from the National Academy of Sciences. Subsequently, while reading 
through Galileo's notebooks, he found that Galileo had seen the planet 
Neptune, 135 years before its official discovery. Kowal worked at 
Space Telescope Science Institute in support of the Hubble Space 
Telescope, and later worked on the Near Earth Asteroid Rendezvous 
(NEAR) mission at the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory. He 
retired in 2006. An obituary has been published at:

NORDIC-NASA SUMMER SCHOOL

The Nordic-NASA summer school "Water, Ice and the Origin of Life in 
the Universe", which will be held in Iceland from 2 to 15 July 2012, 
aims to give participants a thorough high-level introduction into the 
role of water in the evolution of life in the cosmos, starting from
formation of water molecules in space and ending with evolution of the 
first organisms. It will bring together students and researchers from 
a multitude of different subjects, making it a truly multidisciplinary 
event. The event will be organized by the Nordic Astrobiology Network 
(http://www.nordicastrobiology.net) together with the NASA Astrobiology 
Institute. Field studies on the colonization of lava fields and 
glaciers will complement the lectures.

The event is aimed for graduate students and early career scientists 
(up to 5 years after their first Ph.D.)  in fields related to 
astrobiology. The event is open to applicants from all nationalities.

Detailed information about the summer school and the application 
procedure (deadline 31 January 2012) can be found at: 

http://www.nordicastrobiology.net/Iceland2012

Applicants accepted by the Scientific Committee as participants will 
receive free lodging, meals and excursions, but will have to organize 
financial means for their travel to and from Iceland.

GRADUATE STUDENT OPPORTUNITIES AT STONY BROOK UNIVERSITY

The Department of Geosciences at Stony Brook University (Stony Brook, 
NY) invites applications to its graduate program for Fall 2012, for 
students wishing to pursue research in planetary science.  Research 
opportunities in planetary geology span several disciplines, including 
remote sensing, experimental and theoretical geochemistry, experimental 
petrology, laboratory spectroscopy, and theoretical light scattering 
studies. Particular emphasis is placed on understanding the magmatic 
evolution of Mars and the Moon and aqueous alteration of the Martian 
crust. Facilities and equipment available for pursuing planetary 
geology studies include a custom-built mid-IR emission spectrometer, a 
UV-visible-near-IR reflectance spectrometer, a micro-FTIR imaging 
spectrometer, a micro-Raman imaging spectrometer, a low-temperature 
experimental geochemistry laboratory, a fully-equipped experimental 
petrology laboratory capable of simulating conditions from deep within 
planetary interiors to the surface, a portable thermal imager for field 
studies, and an image processing facility.  Remote sensing studies make 
use of a variety of instruments orbiting Mars and the Moon, as well as 
instruments carried on landed missions, notably the Mars Exploration 
Rovers.  For application and program information, visit: 

http://www.geosciences.stonybrook.edu

Applications are due by January 15, 2012.

EGU 2012, VIENNA, CALL FOR ABSTRACTS

We invite you to submit an abstract to the following session 
(PS5.1/ST6.2) during the next EGU in Vienna, Austria (22-27 April 2012) 
entitled "Planetary Plasma Physics, Including Electrodynamics of 
Induced Magnetospheres".

The emphasis of the session is on all aspects of planetary plasma 
physics, particles, fields and waves, including
(1) magnetospheres, ionospheres, auroras, of solar system and 
extrasolar planets and satellites
(2) the solar wind interaction with inner planets, moons, asteroids, 
dust and comets, and
(3) intercomparisons of planetary magnetospheres and ionospheres.

Contributions are welcome that address previous (e.g. CHANDRAYAAN-1, 
KAGUYA), present (e.g. CASSINI, MARS EXPRESS, VENUS EXPRESS, ROSETTA, 
MESSENGER, CHANG'E 2), forthcoming (e.g. BEPI COLOMBO) and planned 
(e.g. LAPLACE/JUICE) observations from space and from the ground. 
Theoretical modelling and simulations are also strongly encouraged, 
both in themselves and as a basis for intercomparisons and 
interpretation of results.

Deadlines are 17 January 2012 for reception of abstracts, and 
15 December 2011 to apply for financial support.

Conveners: P. Garnier, H. Opgenoorth, M. Lester

FAMELAB ASTROBIOLOGY

Are You the Next Carl Sagan?  Come Find Out at FameLab Astrobiology!
 
Calling all grad students and postdocs doing research related to 
astrobiology....

FameLab Astrobiology is a science communication extravaganza!  Via four 
preliminaries and one final competition, spanning January thru April 
2012, early career astrobiologists will compete to convey their own 
research or related science concepts.  Each contestant has the 
spotlight for only three minutes using no slides, no charts -- just 
the power of words and anything you can hold in your hands.  A panel 
of experts in both science and science communication will do the 
judging.  One of the four preliminaries will be held 100% online via 
YouTube!
 
Beyond the competition, at each preliminary event there will be 
sciencela Scalice at the NASA Astrobiology Institute 
with any questions.

NSF REVIEW AND ARECIBO

The NSF astronomy division is in the process of organizing a 
"portfolio review" of all NSF Astronomy Division-supported activities 
with the goal of again reducing expenditures. Go to:

http://www.nsf.gov/mps/ast/ast_portfolio_review.jsp

That web page solicits community input, and I would encourage each of
you to provide your input to the process.

While the call for input mentions only the "Astro2010" astronomy
decadal survey, the management of Arecibo Observatory has been invited
to submit, by January 6, a "vision statement" for the observatory over 5,
10, and 15 year timescales, to be based on the Astronomy *and* Planetary
Science Decadal Surveys. In addition, at least two of the panel members
have planetary interests, so hopefully the planetary perspective will
be consido have from you any material that you believe might
help us in formulating that vision statement.

Please feel free to share this request with your colleagues.

Regards,
Michael C. Nolan
Arecibo Observatory

beginning the fellowship, but myment program.

Stipends for Postdoctoral Fellows start at $50,000 per year, with 
moderate supplements for high cost-of-living areas and for certain 
academic specialties. Funds are available for relocation expenses, up 
to a specified limit, and health insurance is available through the 
program. Fellows also receive $8,000 per appointment year to support 
travel to conferences, meetings, to support
