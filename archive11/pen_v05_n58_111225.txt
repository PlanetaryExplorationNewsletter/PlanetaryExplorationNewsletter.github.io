PHYSICIST AND FORMER ASTRONAUT JOHN GRUNSFELD TO HEAD NASA SCIENCE 
DIRECTORATE

NASA has named physicist and former astronaut John Grunsfeld as the new 
associate administrator for the Science Mission Directorate at the 
agency's headquarters in Washington. Grunsfeld will take the reins of 
the office effective Jan. 4, 2012. He succeeds Ed Weiler, who retired 
from NASA on Sept. 30.

Grunsfeld currently serves as the deputy director of the Space 
Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore, which manages the science 
program for the Hubble Space Telescope and is a partner in the 
forthcoming James Webb Space Telescope. His background includes 
research in high energy astrophysics, cosmic ray physics and in the 
field of exoplanet studies with specific interest in future 
astronomical instrumentation.

"It is an honor and a privilege to be offered the opportunity to lead 
NASA's Science Mission Directorate during this exciting time in the 
agency's history," Grunsfeld said. "Science at NASA is all about 
exploring the endless frontier of the Earth and space. I look forward 
to working with the NASA team to help enable new discoveries in our 
quest to understand our home planet and unravel the mysteries of the 
universe."

CPS 9TH INTERNATIONAL SCHOOL OF PLANETARY SCIENCES

Registration is now open for the upcoming school.

Objective and Scope: The objective of the school is to promote
education and research in planetary sciences for highly motivated
graduate students and young researchers by providing them with an
opportunity to interact with leading scientists in a specific
field. Note that the term "Planetary Sciences" is used in a
broader sense to include astronomy, astrophysics, astrochemistry,
astrobiology, astromineralogy, geosciences, space science,
cosmology, and other related fields.

The topic of the coming school: Across the Earth into Exoplanets

The first circular and the detailed information are now available 
at the CPS website:

a poster presentation to the PS2.4 Session on Mars Science & 
Exploration, where results of ongoing and future European and 
international missions to Mars will be presented and discussed. Thank 
you for your consideration.

RADAR SESSION AT 34TH INTERNATIONAL GEOLOGICAL CONGRESS

Please consider submitting an abstract for the session on RADAR in 
Planetary Exploration, to be held at the 34th International Geological 
Congress in Bribane, Australia, 5-10 August 2012. There are also a 
couple of planetary-related field trips.

http://www.34igc.org/

GPR and SAR radars contribute to our knowledge of the distribution of 
ice on Earth and Mars, and of the geology of outer solar system 
planetary bodies, such as Titan. This symposium welcomes contributions 
in all areas of radar technology applied to the remote  observation of 
solar system objects.

We hope to see you in Brisbane,

[NASA] POSTDOCTORAL FELLOWSHIPS

The NASA Postdoctoral Program (NPP) offers scientists and engineers 
unique opportunities to conduct research at NASA Centers. Each NPP 
fellowship opportunity is designed to advance NASA research in a 
specific project related to space science, earth science, aeronautics, 
space operations, exploration systems, lunar science, or astrobiology.

Applicants must have a Ph.D. or equivalent degree in hand before 
beginning the fellowship, but may apply while completing the degree 
requirements. U. S. citizens, Lawful Permanent Residents, and foreign 
nationals eligible for J-1 status as a Research Scholar may apply.  
An H-1B Visa status is not acceptable because the NPP is not an 
employment program.

Stipends for Postdoctoral Fellows start at $50,000 per year, with 
moderate supplements for high cost-of-living areas and for certain 
academic specialties. Funds are available for relocation expenses, up 
to a specified limit, and health insurance is available through the 
program. Fellows also receive $8,000 per appointment year to support 
travel to conferences, meetings, and other activities that directly 
support their research.

Applications are accepted three times each year: March 1, July 1, 
and November 1.

ANNOTATED LISTING OF ASTRONOMY APPS FOR PHONES AND TABLETS PUBLISHED 
IN ASTRONOMY EDUCATION REVIEW

An annotated overview of 98 astronomy applications for smart phones 
and tablets has been published in the on-line journal "Astronomy 
Education Review."  Compiled by Andrew Fraknoi (Foothill College), the 
list features a brief description and a direct URL for each app.

You can access the article free of charge at: 

http://aer.aas.org/resource/1/aerscz/v10/i1/p010302_s1 

The listing includes a variety of apps for displaying and explaining 
the sky above you (some using the GPS function in your device); a 
series of astronomical clocks, calculators, and calendars; sky catalogs 
and observing planners; planet atlases and globes; citizens science 
tools and image displays; a directory of astronomy clubs in the U.S.; 
and even a graphic simulator for making galaxies collide. A number of 
the apps are free, and others cost just a dollar or two. A brief list 
of articles featuring astronomy app reviews is also included. 

Astronomy Education Review is on-line journal about astronomy education 
and outreach, published by the American Astronomical Society, which 
celebrated its 10th anniversary this fall.  You can find it at:
