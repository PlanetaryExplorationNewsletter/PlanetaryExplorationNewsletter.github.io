NASA PLANETARY SCIENCE SUBCOMMITTEE TO DISCUSS DECADAL SURVEY AND 
RECENT BUDGET DEVELOPMENTS

The Planetary Science Subcommittee of the NASA Advisory Council will be 
meeting in Washington, DC, on April 18-19, 2011, at NASA Headquarters. 
They will be discussing responses to the recently released planetary 
decadal survey and strategies for implementing it.  Jim Green will give 
a preliminary report on the impact of the 2011 budget passed last week 
by Congress and signed by the President.  In that budget, NASA Science 
was increased by 10% over 2010, only 1.3% below that requested in the 
President's budget.

The PSS agenda is posted at:

POSTDOCTORAL RESEARCHER IN PLANETARY MAPPING:  LUNAR AND PLANETARY
INSTITUTE

The Universities Space Research Association's Lunar and Planetary 
Institute (LPI), in Houston TX, invites applications for a 
postdoctoral fellowship in planetary science.  The successful 
candidate will work with Dr. Paul Schenk, investigating the topography 
of Jupiter's volcanic moon Io using stereo and shape-from-shading 
techniques (although experience in these tools is not required).  A 
variety of landforms will be mapped, including volcanoes and mountains, 
as well as regional and global scale shape deviations.  The candidate 
will also be expected to develop their own research projects using this 
data.  Candidate must have a recent Ph.D. in geology or geophysics.  
In addition, the candidate shall have a strong background in remote 
sensing/image processing of spacecraft data, and preferably experience 
in geophysical or volcanological investigations.  The position is 
generally for two years, with a possible extension to a maximum of 
three years. Further information on current research and facilities at 
the LPI can be found on our website:

http://www.lpi.usra.edu

The Universities Space Research Association is an Equal Opportunity 
Employer.

JSPS-DST ASIA ACADEMIC SEMINAR AND CPS 8TH INTERNATIONAL SCHOOL OF 
PLANETARY SCIENCES JOINT ASSEMBLY

Registration is now open for the upcoming school:  "Challenges in 
Astronomy: Observational Advances"

The objective of the school/seminar is to promote education and 
research in planetary sciences for highly motivated graduate students 
and young researchers by providing them with an opportunity to 
interact with leading scientists in a specific field.  Note that the 
term "Planetary Sciences" is used in a broader sense to include 
astronomy, astrophysics, astrochemistry, astrobiology, astromineralogy, 
geosciences, space science, cosmology, and other related fields.

The second circular and the detailed program are now available at the 
CPS Web site:

NEW "DISCOVERIES IN PLANETARY SCIENCE" CLASSROOM POWERPOINTS AVAILABLE

The DPS Education Subcommittee announces the 4th release of
"Discoveries in Planetary Science" Classroom Powerpoints, covering
six new topics:

- A Thousand New Planets
- Buried Martian Carbonates
- The Lunar Core
- A Six Planet System
- Martian Gully Formation
- Propellers in Saturn's Rings

These are succinct summaries of discoveries too recent to appear in
"Intro Astronomy" college textbooks; each set consists of just three
slides to be shown: the discovery itself, a basic explanation based on
good planetary science, and the "big picture" context.  Another page 
for further information is provided as well. Powerpoints and PDFs can 
be downloaded from:

http://dps.aas.org/education/dpsdisc

Feedback from the community on how these slide sets are used and
received is welcomed, and will be used to improve future releases. 
Planetary scientists with recent or upcoming results of broad interest 
are encouraged to submit them for consideration by providing an initial 
draft using the template provided on the website. For more information, 
contact Nick Schneider & Dave Brain at dpsdisc@aas.org.
