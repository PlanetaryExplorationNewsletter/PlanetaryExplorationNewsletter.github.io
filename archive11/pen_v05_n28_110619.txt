APPLICATION DEADLINE FOR THE NASA POSTDOCTORAL PROGRAM

The next deadline to apply for a NASA Postdoctoral Program fellowship 
is July 1, 2011.  These competitive one- to three-year fellowship 
appointments advance NASA's missions in space science, Earth science, 
aeronautics, space operations, exploration systems and astrobiology.
 
Applicants must have a Ph.D. or equivalent degree in hand before 
beginning the fellowship, but may apply while completing the 
dissertation. U. S. citizens and foreign nationals who hold Lawful 
Permanent Resident status or who are eligible for J-1 status as a 
Research Scholar may apply.  An H-1B Visa status is not acceptable 
because the NPP is not an employment program.
 
Stipend rates for Postdoctoral Fellows start at $50,000 per year, 
with small supplements added for high cost-of-living areas.  Funds 
are available for relocation expenses, up to a specified limit.  
Fellows also receive $8,000 per appointment year to support travel 
to conferences, meetings, and other activities that directly support 
their research projects.
 
Applications for the NASA Postdoctoral Program are accepted three 
times each year: March 1, July 1, and November 1.

[NASA] COMMENT PERIOD FOR DRAFT OF SOLICITATION (ASTROPHYSICS 
TECHNOLOGY FELLOWSHIPS FOR EARLY CAREER RESEARCHERS)

The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Science 
Mission Directorate (SMD) is releasing a draft solicitation for 
community review and comment: Astrophysics Technology Fellowships for 
Early Career Researchers (ATF). This solicitation will be a program 
element appendix to the NASA Research Announcement "Research 
Opportunities in Space and Earth Sciences (ROSES) 2011" (NNH10ZDA001N).  
Upon the release date, the full text of the draft solicitation will be 
available at:
 
http://nspires.nasaprs.com/

The objective of this solicitation is to give early career researchers 
the opportunity to develop the skills necessary to lead astrophysics 
flight instruments/projects and become principal investigators (PIs) of 
future astrophysics missions; to develop innovative technologies that 
have the potential to enable major scientific breakthroughs; and to 
foster new talent by putting early-career instrument builders on a 
trajectory towards long-term positions.

The comment period for the draft ATF program element ends on July 8, 
2011. 

Comments may be addressed in writing or by e-mail to the ATF Program

[NASA] PDS RELEASE 6 OF LUNAR RECONNAISSANCE ORBITER DATA

The NASA Planetary Data System is pleased to announce a new delivery 
of Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) data for the following 
instruments: CRaTER, DLRE, LAMP, LEND, LOLA, LROC and  Mini-RF.  Radio 
Science Tracking data will be released shortly.   SPICE data will be 
released later this summer.

In general, LRO Release 6 includes data collected between December 15, 
2010 and March 14, 2011.

To access the above data, please visit the following link:

http://pds.nasa.gov/subscription_service/SS-20110615.html

PDS offers two services for searching the LRO archives:

1.  The Planetary Image Atlas at the Imaging Node allows selection of 
LRO data by specific search criteria: 

http://pds-imaging.jpl.nasa.gov/search/lro/

2.  The Lunar Orbital Data Explorer at the Geosciences Node allows 
searching and downloading of LRO data and other lunar orbital data 
sets (Clementine and Lunar Prospector):

PLANETARY SCIENCE WORKFORCE SURVEY

Just how many planetary scientists are there working in the US?  
And how did they get to their current positions?

The American Institute of Physics is conducting a NASA-sponsored
survey of the workforce in planetary sciences.  If you are a member of
AGU, DPS/AAS, the Meteoritical Society or attend LPSC then you 
will likely receive an email request to fill in an online survey.

In the meantime, a survey of 48 US academic departments that include
planetary science was completed this spring.

Description of the project and results of the department survey are 
posted at:

FALL AGU SESSION P34: USING THE EARTH AS A GUIDE TO EXTRATERRESTRIAL  
PLANETARY SURFACES

We hope you will consider submitting an abstract to session P34:
Using the Earth as a Guide to Extraterrestrial Planetary Surfaces at  
the AGU Fall Meeting 2011.

This session will focus on work that examines planetary surface  
processes and properties through the use of terrestrial analogs. Of  
particular interest will be projects that include terrestrial field  
observations that directly aid in the interpretation of planetary data  
sets. The session will encompass a wide range of topics that are  
expected to include both morphological and compositional studies,  
including both ground-based and orbital data sets; however, all  
studies will be unified by a strong basis in terrestrial geology. The  
goal of this session is to encourage workers to utilize terrestrial  
geological techniques to directly inform interpretations of  
extraterrestrial features, using site-specific examples.

Further details on this session are available at:

http://sites.agu.org/fallmeeting/scientific-program/session-search/668

Conveners:
Craig Hardgrove, Stony Brook University
Nina Lanza, University of New Mexico

The meeting is December 5-9, 2011 in San Francisco. The abstract
deadline is August 4, 2011.
