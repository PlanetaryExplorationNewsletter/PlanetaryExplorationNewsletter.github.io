PASSING OF TOM GEHRELS (1925-2011)

Planetary science suffered another loss this week with the passing of 
Tom Gehrels, 86, a long-time professor at the Lunar and Planetary 
Laboratory at the University of Arizona. He pioneered the study of 
wavelength dependence of polarization of stars and planets and was the 
principal investigator for the Pioneer 10 and 11 Imaging 
Photopolarimeters. He studied asteroids for much of his career and 
founded the Spacewatch Project at Kitt Peak. He also founded the 
highly respected Space Science Series. He will be greatly missed.

AGU FALL 2011 SESSION: NG05. EXTREME SPACE WEATHER

We invite our planetary science colleagues to consider submitting an  
abstract.

This session will focus on solar, interplanetary, *planetary*,  
astrophysical, magnetospheric, ionospheric and atmospheric phenomena  
that can be directly observed, simulated in advanced models, inferred  
from paleo-data (such as ice cores, rocks, and meteorites) and  
observed from a multitude of stars like the Sun. The extremes of  
interest include events like the 1859 Carrington event, as well as the  
recent deep extended solar minimum. What are the worst cases that we  
should prepare for in terms of geomagnetic storms, energetic-particle  
populations, or solar irradiance changes? Should we care about  
experiencing a modern-day Maunder Minimum? What are the implications  
for planets and exoplanets, both in the present epoch and in the past?  
Predictions for the next solar cycle are welcome.

Questions can be directed to any of the session organizers: Bruce  
Tsurutani (bruce.tsurutani@jpl.nasa.gov), Karel Schrijver, Lika  
Guhathakurta, Walter Gonzalez, Tony Mannucci, Gibor Basri, Dave

AGU FALL 2011 SESSION: P02. ACCRETION AND DIFFERENTIATION OF 
TERRESTRIAL PLANETS - EXPERIMENTS AND MODELING

The two major events in terrestrial planet formation are accretion and
differentiation. These processes are best studied through analog
experiments and theoretical modeling. Experimental approaches include
exploring melt and fluids phase equilibria, major and trace element 
partitioning coefficients, isotopic data and physical differentiation
processes. Computational approaches include models of impact 
processes, core formation, magma ocean evolution and mantle 
convection. We invite contributions that advance our understanding
of terrestrial planet formation or that highlight new concepts for 
future investigations. Contributions emphasizing a lab-modeling 
multidisciplinary approach are particularly welcome.

AGU FALL 2011 SESSION: P03. ACTIVE MARS SURFACE PROCESSES AND THE ROLE
OF VOLATILES
 
One of the most important recent revelations about Mars is the number,
diversity, and breadth of scale of surface processes that are 
currently active. The realization that Mars is a geologically and 
geochemically dynamic planet derives from recent observations and 
ongoing, multi-year spacecraft monitoring at high spatial, spectral,
and temporal resolution. The roles of volatiles H2O and CO2 are 
central to much of this activity, yet are far from understood. 
Surface activity of interest to the session may involve redistribution
of volatiles themselves, the direct or indirect influence by volatiles,
geochemical volatile-surface interaction, or very little apparent
direct involvement of volatiles. Examples include, but are certainly
not limited to: Ground ice processes; transient or recurring features
or events, e.g., slope markings, south polar CO2-frost fans, spiders,
etc., north polar avalanches, dust devils; geomorphic features such as 
dunes, other aeolian features, and gullies, especially whose activity
may involve or be mediated by volatiles; polar residual cap evolution;
seasonal patterns of ice and frost distribution; surface & near-surface 
geochemical interactions and weathering processes; change monitoring of
geomorphic, spectral, and ephemeral features.

AGU FALL 2011 SESSION: P12. HYDROTHERMAL MARS - ANALOGS AND 
OBSERVATIONS

We seek to bring together scientists working on observational and 
theoretical studies of hydrothermal activity, both on Earth and Mars.

If you are working on a related project, please consider submitting 
for this session.

Session Description:
Description: Evidence for the presence of volatiles in the martian 
past, coupled with a history of volcanic and impact activity, indicate 
that hydrothermal activity likely occurred on Mars. Recent 
spectroscopic detection of minerals consistent with high-temperature 
alteration suggest hydrothermal origins. We wish to combine 
terrestrial analog studies, laboratory, and modeling experiments to 
address remote sensing observations of potential hydrothermal products 
on Mars.

AGU FALL 2011 SESSION: P19. MERCURY - THE VIEW FROM ORBIT

Conveners:  
Sean C. Solomon 
Brian J. Anderson 
Ralph L. McNutt, Jr. 
Louise M. Prockter

After three successful flybys of Mercury, NASA's MESSENGER spacecraft 
began orbiting the innermost planet in March of this year. The orbital 
phase of the mission is enabling the first global perspective on
Mercury's geology, surface composition, topography, gravity, and 
internal magnetic field and the first continuous observations of the 
planet's exosphere, magnetosphere, and solar-wind interaction. This
session will highlight the latest results on Mercury from MESSENGER 
measurements obtained during the initial eight months of orbital 
operations. The conveners also welcome contributed papers on 
complementary ground-based observations, laboratory measurements, and 
theoretical developments relevant to planetary processes at Mercury.

AGU FALL 2011 SESSION: P35. USING TOPOGRAPHY TO INVESTIGATE THE 
EVOLUTION OF SOLAR SYSTEM BODIES

We invite abstracts to the session "Using Topography to Investigate 
the Evolution of Solar System Bodies" for the Fall AGU meeting in 
San Francisco, December 5-9, 2011. We seek to bring together 
scientists who use topographic measurements as part of their efforts 
to better understand the evolution of planets, asteroid and comets.
 
Description: Spacecraft data have enabled the surface topography of 
many solar system bodies to be determined. These data provide insight 
into near-surface processes and properties that exist over the 
visible history of a body, on global and local scales. We invite 
abstracts on any topic in which topography plays a role. These may
describe theoretical investigations, laboratory studies or data 
analysis of any body in the solar system and can include (but are 
not limited to): topographic measurements that are indicative of the 
types of surface terrain or environments present; processes that 
create or erase/erode surface topography at any scale; and subsurface
processes that are expressed by surface topography.

AGU FALL 2011 SESSION: SA06. IONOSPHERES OF UNMAGNETIZED PLANETS - 
VENUS, MARS, AND TITAN

Dear Colleagues,

We kindly invite you to submit an abstract to the session
SA06: Ionospheres of Unmagnetized Planets: Venus, Mars and Titan
at the 2011 AGU Fall Meeting in San Francisco (5-9 December). 
Abstracts are due August 4.

Atmospheric dynamics, solar photons, energetic particles and induced 
and intrinsic magnetic fields combine in myriad ways to create 
planetary ionospheres. Venus has a dense dayside ionosphere and 
mysterious ionospheric 'holes' on the night side. Locally intense 
remnant crustal magnetic fields alter Mars' otherwise Venus-like 
ionosphere to create a plasma laboratory unique in the solar system. 
Titan is bombarded by solar photons and Kronian energetic electrons, 
creating a dynamic ionosphere and rich hydrocarbon chemistry. In all 
cases, these ionospheres are the reservoirs for atmospheric escape. 
Related contributions are sought covering recent advances or reviews
of observations, numerical modeling or relevant laboratory 
experiments.

AGU FALL 2011 SESSION: V11. INFERRING PROCESSES FROM VOLCANIC DEPOSITS
IN THE SOLAR SYSTEM

Colleagues,

We would like to draw your attention and encourage your contributions 
to the Fall 2011 AGU session: V11. Inferring Processes From Volcanic 
Deposits in the Solar System

This session will bring together physical volcanologists from the 
planetary and terrestrial geology communities and explore the current
understanding of explosive and effusive volcanology. Topics may 
include field and remote-sensing investigations of volcanic deposits 
that aim to further our understanding of formation or degradation 
processes (e.g. pyroclastic deposit emplacement, lava flow inflation, 
deposit erosion). Bringing planetary, terrestrial, explosive and 
effusive volcanologist together will help to address current problems
in the field and identify gaps in our current understanding of 
volcanic processes.

This session is sponsored by: Volcanology, Geochemistry and Petrology
together with Planetary Sciences.

Please do not hesitate to contact the conveners (below) if you have 
any questions.

ESA POSTDOCTORAL FELLOWSHIPS IN SPACE SCIENCE

The European Space Agency awards several postdoctoral fellowships each
year. The aim of these fellowships is to provide young scientists, 
holding a PhD or the equivalent degree, with the means of performing 
space science research in fields related to the ESA Science and 
Robotic Exploration Programmes. Areas of research include planetary 
science, astronomy and astrophysics, solar and solar-terrestrial 
science, plasma physics and fundamental physics. The fellowships have 
a duration of two years and are tenable at the European Space Research 
and Technology Centre (ESTEC) in Noordwijk, Netherlands, or at the 
European Space Astronomy Centre (ESAC) in Villafranca del Castillo, 
near Madrid, Spain.

Applications are now solicited for fellowships in space science to 
begin in the fall of 2012. Preference will be given to applications 
submitted by candidates within five years of receiving their PhD. 
Candidates not holding a PhD yet are encouraged to apply, but they 
must provide evidence of receiving their degree before starting the 
fellowship.

PLANETARY PROTECTION RESEARCH PROGRAM SUBMISSION   

Deadline: September 2, 2011.  
Of particular interest are the following areas:

* Limits of life in laboratory simulations of planetary environments, 
particularly studies of the distribution and dynamics of organisms 
in conditions present on Mars (including gullies and ice-rich 
environments) or within a subsurface ocean as may be present on icy 
satellites - potentially in the presence of a heat source brought 
from Earth;

* Modeling of planetary environmental conditions and transport 
processes that could affect transport of spacecraft-associated 
contaminants to locations in which Earth organisms might thrive, 
for example Mars Special Regions or the subsurface of icy bodies 
such as Europa and other outer planet satellites;

* Development of modern molecular analytical methods to rapidly 
detect, classify, and/or enumerate the spectrum of Earth microbes 
carried by spacecraft. Of particular interest are methods capable 
of identifying microbes with high potential for surviving spacecraft
flight or planetary environmental conditions (e.g., anaerobes, 
psychrophiles, radiation-resistant organisms);

* Technologies, and procedures for sterilization compatible with 
spacecraft materials and assemblies.

Questions concerning the Planetary Protection Program may be addressed
