AIGS 2011 NEW ANNOUNCEMENT - 25 MARCH, 2011 IS THE EXTENDED DEADLINE
FOR ABSTRACT SUBMISSION & REGISTRATION FEE WAIVER APPLICATION

Dear Members, Colleagues and Friends of AOGS

The calamity in Japan is very unfortunate and to accommodate AOGS 
members here, the deadline for abstract submission and registration 
fee wavier application will be extended by 10 days, till 25 March, 
2011.

As you can imagine, many are busy with the March 11 M9 earthquake and 
resultant tsunami. Japan has the largest share of AOGS members and the 
single most important thing is to ensure that they are safe. Many are 
also supporting rescue and radiation decontanmination efforts. 

This week, our hearts go out to the people here and do join me to wish 
Japan a speedy recovery. Thank you.

Minhan DAI, AOGS 2011 Program Chair
AOGS Secretary General & OS Section Vice-President

[NASA] PDS - LUNAR RECONNAISSANCE ORBITER DATA RELEASE 5

The NASA Planetary Data System is pleased to announce a new delivery of 
Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) data for the following instruments:  
CRaTER, DLRE, LAMP, LEND, LOLA, and LROC.  Mini-RF and SPICE data will 
be released shortly.  This release includes a new LAMP product, Level 5 
Gridded Data Records and a new LOLA SHADR product.

In general, LRO Release 5 includes data collected between September 15 
and December 14, 2010.

To access the above data, please visit the following link:

http://pds.nasa.gov/subscription_service/SS-20110315.html

PDS offers two services for searching the LRO archives:

(1) The Planetary Image Atlas at the Imaging Node allows selection of 
LRO data by specific search criteria: 

http://pds-imaging.jpl.nasa.gov/search/lro/

(2) The Lunar Orbital Data Explorer at the Geosciences Node allows 
searching and downloading of LRO data and other lunar orbital data 
sets (Clementine and Lunar Prospector):

SETI INSTITUTE SEMINAR SERIES IS TURNING 130

The SETI Seminar Series is a weekly scientific colloquium held in
Mountain View California. We have speakers from around the Bay Area and
beyond talk about their latest science results. Every Sunday we archive
a new talk here, there are almost 130 talks online to view:

http://youtube.com/setiinstitute

Latest talks include 'New Horizons' by Alan Stern, 'Evidence for a
Subsurface Ocean on Titan' by Francis Nimmo, and 'Habitability of
Martian Permafrost' by Aaron Zent.

Send any comments or questions to Dr. Adrian Brown, abrown@seti.org.

[NASA] DUE DATES DELAYED FOR ASTROBIOLOGY SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY FOR 
EXPLORING PLANETS (ASTEP)

Astrobiology Science and Technology for Exploring Planets (ASTEP) 
program solicits proposals for investigations focused on exploring the 
Earth's extreme environments in order to develop a sound technical and 
scientific basis to conduct astrobiological research on other solar 
system bodies.

Programmatic schedule conflicts at NASA Headquarters have postponed 
the ASTEP peer review and hence the date when SMD must have Notices of 
Intent (NOI) proposals. The due date for ASTEP NOIs has been changed 
to Friday, July 22, 2011. The due date for ASTEP proposals has been 
changed to Friday, September 16, 2011. 

Questions concerning ASTEP may be addressed to:

DEADLINE FOR BARRINGER GRANT APPLICATIONS APPROACHING

Graduate students and postdocs,

The application deadline for grants from the Barringer Family Fund for 
Meteorite Impact Research is April 8, 2011. This program provides 3 to 
5 competitive grants each year in the range of $2,500 to $5,000 USD 
for support of field research at known or suspected impact sites 
worldwide. Grant funds may be used to assist with travel and 
subsistence costs, as well as laboratory and computer analysis of 
research samples and findings. Masters, doctoral, and post-doctoral 
students enrolled in formal university programs are eligible. Over the 
past 9 years, 30 research projects have been supported. For additional 
details and an application, please go to:

http://www.lpi.usra.edu/science/kring/Awards/Barringer_Fund/index.html

The Barringer Family Fund for Meteorite Impact Research has been 
established as a memorial to recognize the contributions of Brandon, 
Moreau, Paul, and Richard Barringer to the field of meteoritics and 
the Barringer family's strong interest and support over many years in 
research and student education. The Fund also reflects the family's 
long-standing commitment to responsible stewardship of The Barringer 
Meteorite Crater and the family's steadfast resolve in maintaining the 
crater as a unique scientific research and education site.

OPPORTUNITY

The Gerald A. Soffen Memorial Fund is pleased to announce the first of 
two 2011 Travel Grant application opportunities for undergraduate and 
graduate students pursuing studies in fields of space science and 
engineering.

The Travel Grants, in the amount of $500, enable student recipients 
to attend professional meetings to present their research. The first 
2011 Travel Grant application deadline is April 15, 2011. Jerry Soffen, 
a biologist by training, led a distinguished career in NASA, including 
serving as the Project Scientist for Viking and as an architect for the 
NASA Astrobiology Institute. The Travel Grant continues Jerry's 
dedication to educating and involving future generations in space 
science and engineering pursuits. The electronic application materials 
and instructions are located on the Soffen Fund website:

SECOND MEETING OF THE INTERNATIONAL PRIMITIVE BODY EXPLORATION WORKING
GROUP (IPEWG 2011)

We are pleased to announce that the Second Meeting of the International 
Primitive Body Exploration Working Group (IPEWG 2011) will be held 
August 22-24 in Pasadena, CA. Information regarding meeting logistics 
and a preliminary program will be released shortly as well as a call 
for poster abstracts. Please note that the fifth meeting of the NASA 
Small Body Assessment Group (SBAG) will also take place in Pasadena 
directly following IPEWG 2011, on August 25-26.

The discussions held at this meeting are expected to impact and improve 
international collaboration activities for primitive body space 
exploration. Topics include: Missions, Data Sharing, Sample Sharing, 
ITAR, and Human Based Exploration. We hope you will attend and 
participate in this important program.

As background for this workshop, you may view the agenda of the first 
IPEWG meeting at: 

http://www.jspec.jaxa.jp/okinawa_index.html

We are currently working to plan the details of the workshop and invite 
subject experts as we prepare to build on the successes of the first 
IPEWG meeting. You may contact Keith Grogan, IPEWG 2011 LOC Chair
