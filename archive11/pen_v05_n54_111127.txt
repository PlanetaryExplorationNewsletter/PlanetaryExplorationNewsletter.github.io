POSTDOCTORAL POSITION AVAILABLE - WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY

The Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences at Washington University 
in Saint Louis invites applications for their new Steve Fossett 
Postdoctoral Fellowship.  The Department seeks outstanding candidates 
who will strengthen and complement existing areas of study, including 
both terrestrial and planetary geology, geochemistry, and geophysics.  
Candidates will be encouraged to collaborate directly with Faculty and 
students within the Department, and will be invited to lead a seminar 
in their area of expertise.  Ideal candidates will have 
trans-disciplinary interests, and will interact scientifically with a 
broad spectrum of the Department's members.  This competitive postdoc 
is awarded for a one-year period, which may be extended to a second 
year. Applicants should contact a potential Faculty sponsor to discuss 
additional arrangements.  Applications will be considered until the 
position is filled, but priority will be given to those received 
before January 15, 2012.  For further information:

are eligible to apply for the Dwornik Award. The application deadline 
is January 11th, 2012 (the day after the abstract deadline for LPSC).

[NASA] POSTDOCTORAL FELLOWSHIPS

The NASA Postdoctoral Program (NPP) offers scientists and engineers 
unique opportunities to conduct research at NASA Centers. Each NPP 
fellowship opportunity is designed to advance NASA research in a 
specific project related to space science, earth science, aeronautics, 
space operations, exploration systems, lunar science, or astrobiology.

Applicants must have a Ph.D. or equivalent degree in hand before 
beginning the fellowship, but may apply while completing the degree 
requirements. U. S. citizens, Lawful Permanent Residents, and foreign 
nationals eligible for J-1 status as a Research Scholar may apply.  
An H-1B Visa status is not acceptable because the NPP is not an 
employment program.

Stipends for Postdoctoral Fellows start at $50,000 per year, with 
moderate supplements for high cost-of-living areas and for certain 
academic specialties. Funds are available for relocation expenses, up 
to a specified limit, and health insurance is available through the 
program. Fellows also receive $8,000 per appointment year to support 
travel to conferences, meetings, and other activities that directly 
support their research.

Applications are accepted three times each year: March 1, July 1, 
and November 1.
