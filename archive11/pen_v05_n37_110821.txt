30 LECTURES BY DISTINGUISHED ASTRONOMERS DESCRIBE THE LATEST RESEARCH 
IN EVERYDAY LANGUAGE

Thirty non-technical talks on the latest ideas and discoveries
in astronomy are now available as audio and video podcasts
free of charge through the web and iTunes.  For a complete
list and to begin listening, go to:

http://www.astrosociety.org/education/podcast/

Speakers include:
Frank Drake, who began the experimental search for intelligent life 
among the stars;
Mike Brown, who discovered most of the dwarf planets beyond Pluto 
(and whose humorous talk is entitled "How I Killed Pluto and Why it 
Had it Coming");
Natalie Batalha, project scientists on the Kepler Mission to find 
Earths around other stars;
Alex Filippenko (national professor of the year) on finding black 
holes.

The talks are part of the Silicon Valley Astronomy Lectures, jointly 
sponsored by NASA's Ames Research Center, the Astronomical Society of 
the Pacific, the SETI Institute, and Foothill College.  The four 
organizations have offered six free public lectures per year for the 
last 12 years, with the audience ranging from 400 to 900 people.  
Recent talks have been recorded and made available free of charge as 
a public service, thanks to an anonymous donor.

NASA POSTDOCTORAL FELLOWSHIPS
 
The next deadline to apply for a NASA Postdoctoral Program (NPP) 
fellowship is November 1, 2011.  These competitive one- to three-year 
appointments advance NASA's missions in space science, earth science, 
aeronautics, space operations, exploration systems, lunar science, and 
astrobiology.
 
Applicants must have a Ph.D. or equivalent degree in hand before 
beginning the fellowship, but may apply while completing the degree 
requirements. U. S. citizens and foreign nationals who hold Lawful 
Permanent Resident status or who are eligible for J-1 status as a 
Research Scholar may apply.  An H-1B Visa status is not acceptable 
because the NPP is not an employment program.
 
Stipend rates for Postdoctoral Fellows start at $50,000 per year, with 
moderate supplements for high cost-of-living areas and for certain 
academic specialties. Funds are available for relocation expenses, up 
to a specified limit, and health insurance is available through the 
program. Fellows also receive $8,000 per appointment year to support 
travel to conferences, meetings, and other activities that directly 
support their research.

POSTDOCTORAL RESEARCHER: PETROLOGY OF PLANETARY MATERIALS

The Lunar and Planetary Institute (LPI), part of the Universities 
Space Research Association, invites applications for a postdoctoral 
fellowship in the petrology of planetary materials. The successful 
candidate will work with Dr. Allan Treiman in NASA-funded efforts, 
focusing on planetary crusts and magmas, and their volatile 
constituents; target materials include lunar highlands rocks, Martian 
meteorites, and terrestrial analogs.  These efforts focus on planetary 
samples, starting with analyses by optical microscopy and electron 
microprobe; other instruments are available at nearby Johnson Space 
Center or with external collaborators.  The candidate will be 
encouraged to design and conduct their own research in planetary 
science, propose for external funding, participate in grant review 
panels and analysis groups, and become involved with spacecraft 
missions.

The successful candidate will have a recent Ph.D. in petrology or 
geochemistry; experience with planetary materials is helpful, but 
not required.  The position would be for two years, with possible 
extension to a third year.  Review of candidates will begin on 
November 15, 2011, with a hiring decision as soon as possible 
thereafter. Further information can be found on our website:

POSTDOCTORAL RESEARCHERS IN LUNAR SCIENCE

The Universities Space Research Association's Lunar and Planetary 
Institute (LPI) invites applications for lunar science and exploration 
postdoctoral fellowships.  Opportunities include:

Lunar Surface Geology and Remote Sensing - Using new LRO data; 
integrating it with existing lunar data to evaluate processes 
associated with impact cratering and/or planetary differentiation.  
Experience with orbital remote sensing methods, photometry of lunar 
materials, and photogeology of lunar or lunar-like terrains preferred. 

Experimental and/or Analytical Petrology and Geochemistry - Using 
Apollo and lunar meteorite samples (or synthetic analogues) to 
evaluate processes associated with impact cratering and/or planetary 
differentiation.  Experience with electron and ion microprobes, 
and/or LA-ICPMS techniques preferred.

Modeling of Impact Cratering Processes - Using hydrocodes and 
relevant analytical techniques to evaluate different cratering 
processes on the Moon, to model specific crater or basin-forming 
events, and potentially guide future exploration scenarios. 

The successful candidate will be a member of the new LPI-JSC Center 
for Lunar Science and Exploration (http://www.lpi.usra.edu/nlsi/), 
one of the core teams within the NASA Lunar Science Institute.

WOMEN AND MARS CONFERENCE IN WASHINGTON, D.C.
 
On November 9-10, 2011, Explore Mars, Inc. will be presenting the 
Women and Mars Conference at the Jack Morton Auditorium at George 
Washington University in Washington D.C.  Presented by Explore Mars, 
this conference will bring together women and men from around the 
space/Mars science and engineering community, as well as educators, 
industry representatives, and policy experts to discuss such questions 
and topics as, "Why are so many women interested in Mars exploration?" 
and "How can 'Mars women' help to advance STEM education for young 
women and to reach non tradition audiences?"  In addition, there will 
also be a policy discussion, a probable astronaut panel, and updates 
concerning current and upcoming missions.  Speakers will include 
Rebecca Keiser (NASA), Tiffany Montague (Google), Laurie Leshin (NASA), 
Lisa May (NASA), Penny Boston (New Mexico Tech), Deborah Bass (NASA),

NASA LUNAR SCIENCE INSTITUTE: LUNAR SWIRLS VIRTUAL WORKSHOP

Please save the date and join in the inaugural NASA Lunar Science 
Institute (NLSI) Workshop Without Walls, Sept. 7, 2011, focusing on 
one of the Moon's least understood surface phenomena, lunar dust 
swirls.  NLSI Workshops Without Walls are designed to provide the 
global lunar community with a travel-free format that combines formal 
talks with discussion periods centered around a lunar topic of 
interest.
 
The origin and surficial effects of lunar swirls have been discussed 
for many years, but a universally accepted explanation for their 
formation remains elusive. The NLSI Workshop Without walls will bring 
together leaders in the lunar science community to openly discuss and 
debate the origin as well as the scientific and exploration 
implications of lunar swirls.
 
The workshop will run from 11:30a - 6:00p EDT (8:30a - 3:00p PDT), 
Sept. 7, and will begin with an overview talk by Carle Pieters 
entitled "The Enigmatic Lunar Swirls."
 
Workshop topics include:
- Lunar swirl origins
- Magnetic anomalies
- Space weathering
- Mission observations and new measurements
- Lunar ion and dust transport
 
Participation only requires an internet web browser.

ICARUS SPECIAL ISSUE ANNOUNCEMENT: TERRESTRIAL ANALOG STUDIES IN 
PREPARATION FOR THE MARS SCIENCE LABORATORY MISSION AND BEYOND

Deadline for submission:  December 1, 2011.
 
In March, a workshop titled "Analogue Sites for Mars Missions:  MSL 
and Beyond" was held in Houston, TX.  A summary of the workshop may 
be found here:

http://www.lpi.usra.edu/meetings/analogues2011/analogues20113rd.shtml

A survey of participants indicated there was sufficient interest in 
this topic for a special issue of Icarus.  Participation in the 
special issue is open to all, and is not limited to workshop 
attendees.
 
Submissions will be evaluated based on Icarus' guidelines for authors:

http://www.elsevier.com/wps/find/journaldescription.cws_home/622843/
authorinstructions

Manuscripts must "contain new research - observational, experimental, 
or theoretical - concerning the astronomy, geology, meteorology, 
physics, chemistry, biology, and other scientific aspects of our solar 
system."  Manuscripts that include information about new instrumental 
techniques, logistics, "exploration science," or other technical 
matters must primarily focus on new science achieved through these 
methods.  Prospective authors unsure of the suitability of their 
intended contribution are welcome to submit a short description of
it to:

icarus@astro.cornell.edu.
 
To assist planning for the review of papers for the special issue,
contributors are asked to send a brief letter of intent by October 15, 
2011 to icarus@astro.cornell.edu.
