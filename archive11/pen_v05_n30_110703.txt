GSA-PGD G.K. GILBERT SESSION HONORING DR. STEVE SQUYRES

The Planetary Geology Division of the Geological Society of America 
will hold its annual G.K. Gilbert Award Session at the GSA Annual 
Meeting in Minneapolis, October 9-12, 2011, as part of its 30th 
Anniversary Celebration. This year's honoree is Dr. Steve Squyres, 
Professor, Cornell University.  We are soliciting abstracts for the 
Gilbert session from colleagues and former students/postdocs of 
Dr. Squyres.

The G. K. Gilbert Award is presented annually by the Planetary Geology 
Division of the Geological Society of America for outstanding 
contributions to the solution of fundamental problems in planetary 
geology in the broadest sense, which includes geochemistry, 
mineralogy, petrology, geophysics, geologic mapping, and remote 
sensing.  Such contributions may consist either of a single 
outstanding publication or a series of publications that have had 
great influence in the field. The award is named for the pioneering 
geologist G. K.  Gilbert.  The topic of this year's Gilbert session 
is "Robotic Exploration of Planetary Surfaces".

To submit an abstract please go to this website:

http://gsa.confex.com/gsa/2011AM/top/index.epl

and select:  "213. Robotic Exploration of Planetary Surfaces: 
The G.K. Gilbert Award Session"  You will be taken to the abstract 
submittal page.

AGU FALL 2011 SESSION: P23. PLANETARY ATMOSPHERES AND THEIR EVOLUTION

Sponsor: Planetary Sciences (P)
Co-Sponsor(s): Atmospheric Sciences (A) 

Description: Understanding planetary atmospheres and their evolution 
is one of the most challenging topics in planetary sciences. The 
competing influences of planetary geology, geochemistry, climate, 
atmospheric chemistry, and biology (on the Earth) need to be weighed. 
While geochemical and geological data provide constraints for the 
Earth, data from planetary mission and astronomical observations are 
necessary for other planets. Extrasolar planets have heightened 
interest in planetary atmospheres, for it is by analysis of their 
atmospheres that we will assess the characteristics and habitability 
of these objects. This session welcomes both observational and 
theoretical studies relevant to planetary atmospheres and their 
evolution in and out of our solar system.

AGU FALL 2011 SESSION: U02. DAWN EXPLORES VESTA

NASA's Dawn spacecraft enters orbit around asteroid (4) Vesta in July,
2011. Vesta is a small terrestrial world with a basaltic surface that 
is the likely source of the common HED (howardite-eucrite-diogenite) 
class of meteorites. Science observations by Dawn will include a search 
for satellites, stereo mapping of the surface, multi- and hyperspectral 
imaging in visible to mid-infrared wavelengths, gamma-ray and neutron 
spectroscopy, and radio science. This session will feature initial 
science results from Dawn. We also encourage other contributions 
related to basaltic asteroids, including meteorite studies and 
Earth-based telescopic observations, as well as comparative and analog 
studies of other differentiated bodies.

Conveners:

David Blewett, Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory
Brett Denevi, Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory
Carol Raymond, NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory
Timothy Titus, US Geological Survey

The dates of the AGU Fall meeting are December 5-9, 2011.
The abstract deadline is Thursday, August 4.

ONLINE WORKSHOP ON LUNAR SWIRLS

September 7, 2011, 11:30am - 6pm EDT

Swirls are among the most puzzling features on the surface of the Moon. 
Their bright, looping patterns are unlike anything seen in the solar 
system. The origin of the lunar swirls has been discussed for many 
years, but a universally accepted explanation for their formation 
remains elusive.
 
Current space missions are returning new views of the lunar swirls, 
and these data have the potential to provide tremendous new insights 
into swirl formation. We are therefore hosting an informal, one-day, 
online workshop on lunar swirls using NASA Lunar Science Institute 
(NLSI) remote communications tools. The purpose of this workshop is to 
discuss recent advances in the study of lunar swirls, and how the 
swirls can be used to better understand various solar system 
processes. There will be invited and submitted talks, as well as time 
for informal discussions.

Participation in this workshop will require only an internet 
connection, and it will be available to interested scientists from 
around the world.  To submit an abstract or to register, please visit 
our website:

Abstract deadline is August 1, 2011.  
Registration deadline is September 1, 2011.

appointments advance NASA's missions in space science, Earth science, 
aeronautics, space operations, exploration systems and astrobiology.
 
Applicants must have a Ph.D. or equivalent degree in hand before 
beginning the fellowship, but may apply while completing the degree 
requirements. U. S. citizens and foreign nationals who hold Lawful 
Permanent Resident status or who are eligible for J-1 status as a 
Research Scholar may apply.  An H-1B Visa status is not acceptable 
because the NPP is not an employment program.
 
Stipend rates for Postdoctoral Fellows start at $50,000 per year, 
with small supplements for high cost-of-living areas. Funds are 
available for relocation expenses, up to a specified limit.  Fellows 
also receive $8,000 per appointment year to support travel to

[NASA] SMALL BODIES ASSESSMENT GROUP MEETING, AUGUST 25-26

The 5th NASA Small Bodies Assessment Group Meeting will be held in 
Pasadena at the Westin Hotel, August 25-26. A registration site will 
be posted this month at:

http://www.lpi.usra.edu/sbag/meetings/

Because of the relevance of small bodies to human exploration and the
President's commitment to sending a crewed mission to a near-Earth 
object, SBAG is in the process of being co-chartered by both NASA's 
Science Mission and Exploration Science Mission Directorates. One of 
the topics to be discussed will be the synergies among small bodies, 
Mars, and the Moon in human exploration.

SBAG will be following on the heels of the 2nd International 
Primitive Bodies Exploration Working Group meeting 
(http://ipewg.caltech.edu/), which will discuss potential areas of 
international collaboration in coming years.
