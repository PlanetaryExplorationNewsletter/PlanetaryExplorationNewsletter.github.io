HOUSE SUBCOMMITTEE HEARING ON PLANETARY SCIENCE, TUESDAY NOVEMBER 15

The House Subcommittee on Space and Aeronautics will be holding a 
hearing on "Exploring Mars and Beyond: What's Next for U.S. Planetary 
Science" in 2318 Rayburn HOB on Tuesday, November 15, from 10AM to Noon 
Eastern. Witnesses include Jim Green, NASA Planetary Science Division
Director, and Steve Squyres, who chaired the recent NRC planetary 
decadal survey. Other witnesses are TBD.

The hearing will be webcast live. Go to:

This is an important hearing. The President's 2012 budget request for
NASA (http://www.nasa.gov/news/budget/index.html) proposes increases 
in almost all areas of planetary science except Mars Exploration, which 
is reduced by $355M from 2012 to 2016 by excluding new large Mars 
missions, such as Max-C, the first of several flagships required to 
complete a Mars sample return over several decades. The Planetary 
Decadal Survey identified Max-C as the top recommended flagship 
mission. Should the budgets of other programs be sacrificed to fund 
this project? Does Mars exploration come to an end otherwise, or are 
there other options for restoring a vibrant Mars program after MSL? 
What are the top planetary priorities when budgets are tight?

[NASA] POSTDOCTORAL FELLOWSHIPS

The NASA Postdoctoral Program (NPP) offers scientists and engineers 
unique opportunities to conduct research at NASA Centers. Each NPP 
fellowship opportunity is designed to advance NASA research in a 
specific project related to space science, earth science, aeronautics, 
space operations, exploration systems, lunar science, or astrobiology.

Applicants must have a Ph.D. or equivalent degree in hand before 
beginning the fellowship, but may apply while completing the degree 
requirements. U. S. citizens and foreign nationals who hold Lawful 
Permanent Resident status or who are eligible for J-1 status as a 
Research Scholar may apply.  An H-1B Visa status is not acceptable 
because the NPP is not an employment program.

Stipends for Postdoctoral Fellows start at $50,000 per year, with 
moderate supplements for high cost-of-living areas and for certain 
academic specialties. Funds are available for relocation expenses, up 
to a specified limit, and health insurance is available through the 
program. Fellows also receive $8,000 per appointment year to support 
travel to conferences, meetings, and other activities that directly 
support their research.

Applications for the NASA Postdoctoral Program are accepted: March 1, 
July 1, and November 1.

EXPLORING THE PLANETARY SCIENCE ACHIEVABLE FROM A BALLOON-BASED
OBSERVATORY

Can new capabilities in high altitude balloons open the door for new 
planetary science? Could this platform achieve high-value science, 
offer more flight opportunities, and at drastically lower costs?

These, and similar questions will be explored in an upcoming workshop,  
Exploring the Planetary Science Achievable from a Balloon-Based 
Observatory, at the NASA Glenn Research Center on January 25-26, 2012  
in Cleveland, Ohio.

The primary purpose of the workshop is to determine the level of 
planetary science support there may be for a balloon-based planetary 
observatory.  Balloon platform SOA will be presented. PIs will 
provide highlights and share experiences from recent missions. 
Following the informative sessions, break out panels will explore the 
science that can be achieved.

More information will be available and questions will be answered 
during a virtual meeting scheduled for November 16, 2011 at 11 AM 
Eastern. Please see details at:

POST-DOC OPPORTUNITY - AUBURN UNIVERSITY

Auburn University's Department of Geology and Geography has a post-
doctoral position to be filled by a planetary or impact geologist. 
We have a small impact and planetary geology program and many other 
programs as well. If there are questions about impact/planetary, 
contact David King, Professor of Geology (kingdat@auburn.edu).

Our department seeks a post-doc with a PhD in Geology or Geoscience-
related disciplines beginning as early as January 2012. The 
appointment is for 1.5 years. The person will be collegial, teach two 
introductory geology courses per term, and have the ability to 
collaborate on research projects with the largest group of departmental 
faculty as possible. See:

http://www.auburn.edu/academic/cosam/departments/geology/research/
 
Area of focus is open. Required are exemplary communication, teaching, 
research, and interpersonal skills. Specific duties may include 
fieldwork, laboratory analysis, data assimilation, quantitative 
modeling, and other tasks as appropriate. The post-doc will help with 
the supervision of undergraduate, graduate students, or lab visitors.

Publication of work in peer-review journals is a requirement and the 
candidate will be expected to conduct independent research and bring 
in external funding. The candidate selected for the position must meet 
eligibility requirements to work in the US at the time of appointment.

POSITION I:  RESEARCH SCIENTIST, COMETS AND SMALL BODIES, JET 
PROPULSION LABORATORY, CALTECH
 
The Asteroid, Comets, and Satellites group in the JPL Science Division 
at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology 
has an opening available for a research scientist in comets, asteroids, 
or other small primitive bodies in the Solar System. Minimum 
qualifications include a Ph.D. in planetary science or a related field, 
a record of research in solar system primitive bodies science as 
demonstrated by publications, good computer and software skills, and 
expertise in modeling the physics and chemistry of primitive solar 
system bodies, or analysis of spacecraft and/or ground-based 
observations (optical, IR, or sub-mm) of these bodies. It is 
anticipated that future work in connection with other small body 
missions will be possible and is encouraged.

position is being advertised. It is anticipated that future work in 
connection with other small body missions will be possible and is 
encouraged.
