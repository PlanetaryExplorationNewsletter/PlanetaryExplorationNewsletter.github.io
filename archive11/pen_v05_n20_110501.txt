IPEWG-2011 CALL FOR ABSTRACTS

Dear Colleagues:
 
We are pleased to announce that from today, the poster abstract 
submission for the 2011 International Primitive Body Exploration 
Working Group Meeting is available at the meeting website: 

http://ipewg.caltech.edu
 
Dates : August 22-24, 2011
Venue: Pasadena, CA
 
Abstracts will be accepted until August 1st. Further information about 
the meeting, agenda details and abstract submission are all available 
at the meeting website.
 
The discussions held at this meeting are expected to open new 
international collaboration opportunities for primitive body space 
exploration. We hope you will attend and participate in this important 
program.
 
Sincerely, on behalf of the organizing committee,
 
Keith Grogan
IPEWG 2011 LOC Chair

EPSC-DPS SPECIAL SESSION - ACTIVE SURFACE PROCESSES ON MARS

Convener: AS McEwen 
Co-Conveners: N. Thomas, C. Hansen, M. Masse 

http://meetingorganizer.copernicus.org/EPSC-DPS2011/session/8297

New results from high-resolution imaging has shown a range of active
surface processes on Mars: gully incision and deposition at dozens of 
locations, especially in dunes; more than 200 new impact events, some 
exposing shallow ice; avalanches off the edges of the north polar ice 
cap; migration of aeolian ripples and shifting sand deposits; slope 
streaks; dust devils; rock falls; and a bizarre suite of activities 
associated with seasonal and perennial CO2. Of special interest are 
implications for environmental change with orbital variations (i.e., 
what can happen today vs. what required different conditions). Also of 
special interest is the question of whether liquid water or brines are 
involved in any of these current processes.

Abstracts are due 31 May 2011.

EPSC-DPS SPECIAL SESSION - PLASMA AT VENUS AND MARS

Magnetospheres and Space Physics Session #1 
Plasma Processes at  Venus and Mars: Observations and Modeling

The plasma environments of Mars and Venus are determined by the  
interaction of the solar wind and radiation with their atmospheres.  
Beside electron impacts and photoionization, charge exchange processes
have important specific consequences like the emission of X-rays and  
the production of Energetic Neutral Atoms which allow remote  
diagnostics of plasma processes. The aim of this session is to offer  
an opportunity to compare in situ and remote observations to model  
predictions of plasma processes in the Venusian and Martian  
environments. These two planets targeted by numerous missions could  
serve as test benches for future diagnostics of plasma processes  
occurring near remote planets.

Conveners: G. Chanteur, T. Cravens, D. Brain, U. Mostl

NEW VENUS COLLOQUIUM SERIES

Would your institution like a visit and colloquium presentation from 
an expert in Venus science, at no expense to you?  Would you like
travel support to share your Venus research? Presenters and host 
institutions are sought for the new Venus Colloquium Series, a program 
matching planetary scientists with university campuses and research 
institutions.
 
Participation is open to two- and four-year undergraduate colleges and 
research institutions throughout the United States. Host institutions 
commit to making the necessary local arrangements.  Presenters are 
encouraged to address the needs of the next generation of scientists 
(graduate students, interns, and undergraduates) and give an 
additional presentation that is free and open to the general public. 
Other interactions that increase awareness of terrestrial planet 
processes may also be part of the visit. These could be guest teaching 
a class, interacting informally with students and faculty, or other 
activities.
 
The Venus Colloquium Series will cover the presenter's travel expenses. 
There will be no honorarium for the speaker. A current list of 
presenters and their prospective talks and applications for both 
presenter and institutions can also be found at:

[NASA] PLANETARY INSTRUMENT DEFINITION AND DEVELOPMENT (PIDDP) AND 
ASTROBIOLOGY SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY FOR INSTRUMENT DEVELOPMENT (ASTID) 

The Planetary Instrument Definition and Development Program (PIDDP) 
supports the advancement of spacecraft-based instrument technology that 
shows promise for use in scientific investigations on future planetary 
missions. The goal of the program is not to develop flight-qualified 
hardware, but rather to define and develop scientific instruments or 
components of such instruments to the point where the instruments may 
be proposed in response to future announcements of flight opportunity 
without additional extensive technology development. Results of PIDDP 
have contributed to the development of flight hardware flown on, or 
selected for, many of NASA's planetary missions. The proposed 
instrument technology must address specific scientific objectives of 
likely future science missions.

Please note that proposals submitted to  Astrobiology Science and 
Technology for Instrument Development and PIDDP will be reviewed 
together and thus, if identical proposals are submitted to both 
programs, only one will be reviewed. 

The due date for PIDDP Notices of Intent remains unchanged at 
July 15, 2011, but the due date for proposals has been changed to 
August 26, 2011. Go to:

http://nspires.nasaprs.com/ 

select "Solicitations" then "Open Solicitations" then "NNH11ZDA001N".

Questions concerning PIDDP proposals may be addressed to:
