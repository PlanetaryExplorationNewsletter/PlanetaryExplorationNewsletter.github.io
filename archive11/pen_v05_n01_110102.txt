LUNAR RECONNAISSANCE ORBITER DATA RELEASE 4

The NASA Planetary Data System is pleased to announce a new delivery 
of Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) data for the following 
instruments: CRaTER, DLRE, LAMP, LEND, LOLA and LROC.  Mini-RF and 
SPICE data will be released shortly.

In general, LRO Release 4 includes data collected between June 15 
and September 14, 2010.

The following data sets will include revisions of previously 
released products, as explained in the errata.txt file for each 
data set:

LOLA EDR, RDR, GDR: all previously released data revised
LEND EDR, RDR: data products acquired July 3-June 14, 2010 are revised
Diviner RDR: data products acquired July 5-June 15, 2010 are revised

To access the above data, please visit the following link:

PDS offers two services for searching the LRO archives:

The Planetary Image Atlas at the Imaging Node allows selection of LRO 
data by specific search criteria.

The Lunar Orbital Data Explorer at the Geosciences Node allows 
searching and downloading of LRO data and other lunar orbital data 
sets (Clementine and Lunar Prospector).

[NASA] STRATEGIC ASTROPHYSICS TECHNOLOGY

This program element solicits proposals for focused development of 
technologies that feed into and enable missions in the three science 
program areas of the Astrophysics Division: Exoplanet Exploration, 
Physics of the Cosmos, and Cosmic Origins. The Strategic Astrophysics 
Technology (SAT) program is designed to address the mid-TRL "gap" 
between TRL levels 4 and 6. The goal of the SAT program is to support 
the maturation of technologies whose feasibility has already been 
demonstrated to the point where they can be incorporated into NASA 
flight missions.

Through this amendment, the areas of emphasis for strategic investment 
in technology development for NASA's astrophysics programs have been
revised in response to the Astro2010 Decadal Survey, New Worlds, 
New Horizons. Specifically, Sections 2-4 of ROSES-10, Appendix D.11 
contain descriptions of revised areas of technology development that 
are of particular interest to NASA.

NOIs due January 28, 2011. 
Proposals due March 25, 2011.

WORKSHOP ON IDENTIFYING NEO TARGETS FOR HUMAN EXPLORATION

Date: February 22, 2011
Location: George Washing University, Washington DC
Registration:  http://www.gwu.edu/~spi/symposiumrsvp.cfm

The Open Global Community NEO Workshop is being held to discuss our 
knowledge of the NEO population and the extent to which we have 
sufficient known targets to guarantee reasonable accessibility by 
humans. This involves mission design constraints such as delta-velocity 
and mission duration and corresponding quantification of risks. 
Requirements will be determined for expanding our knowledge of the 
NEO population and its characteristics to meet human exploration needs.
A report will be generated for major stakeholder review and 
consideration.

UPCOMING MEETING TO FOCUS ON ROADMAP FOR SMALL BODIES EXPLORATION AND 
TECHNOLOGY NEEDS

The Fourth Meeting of the NASA Small Bodies Assessment Group is being 
held in Washington DC from January 24-26. The first part of the meeting 
will be a Technology Forum on Small Body Scientific Exploration, to 
overview technology needs and the drivers for new science by technology 
and new technology by science. The second part of the meeting will be 
devoted to reviewing and discussing sections of the Roadmap for Small 
Bodies Exploration. This will be a living document supported by the 
small bodies community to provide ongoing input to NASA for the 
exploration of asteroids, comets, the Kuiper Belt and other small 
solar system bodies. It will be updated as new studies are released 
such as the planetary decadal survey and as new discoveries are made 
that may shift our exploration focus and emphasis.

There is no registration fee.
