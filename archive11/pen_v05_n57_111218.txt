PRE-A/O NOTICE: 1ST INTERNATIONAL ANNOUNCEMENT OF OPPORTUNITY FOR
HAYABUSA SAMPLE INVESTIGATION

Dear Colleagues,

The JAXA Hayabusa mission returned samples from asteroid Itokawa in 
June 2010. As you are aware, the samples are not in the condition that 
was originally anticipated and it has taken some time for the curation 
activity to ramp up. The HAYABUSA samples are in the form of tiny 
particles. The Initial Analysis has been performed by the two 
pre-selected teams and initial results has been published in Science 
in August 2011. Now things are ready for the 1st International 
Announcement of Opportunity for HAYABUSA Sample Investigations.

JAXA will issue the 1st International Announcement of Opportunity for 
HAYABUSA Sample Investigations in late January 2012.  Those interested 
in submitting a proposal are invited to visit:

https://planetb.sci.isas.jaxa.jp/hayabusa/Pre_AO.php

where a preliminary version of the HAYABUSA Investigator's Guidebook 
is posted. The Guidebook is intended to help researchers cultivate 
their ideas for proposals while they wait for the release of A/O.

Masaki Fujimoto,
ISAS, JAXA
Chair, Implementation Committee of the 1st International A/O for 
HAYABUSA Sample Investigation

SPACE POLICY INTERNSHIPS AT THE NRC'S SPACE STUDIES BOARD

Lloyd V. Berkner Space Policy Internships are offered twice annually 
in Washington, D.C., by the National Research Council's Space Studies 
Board.  The summer program is restricted to undergraduates, and the 
autumn program is open to both undergraduate and graduate students.  
The deadline for applications for the summer 2012 program is 
February 3, 2012.  Successful candidates will be contacted by 
March 2, 2012.  Applications for the autumn 2012 program will be 
accepted from April 1, 2012 until June 1, 2012.  Successful candidates 
will be contacted by July 6, 2012.  Additional information about the 
program, including application procedure, can be found at:

[NASA] POSTDOCTORAL FELLOWSHIPS

The NASA Postdoctoral Program (NPP) offers scientists and engineers 
unique opportunities to conduct research at NASA Centers. Each NPP 
fellowship opportunity is designed to advance NASA research in a 
specific project related to space science, earth science, aeronautics, 
space operations, exploration systems, lunar science, or astrobiology.

Applicants must have a Ph.D. or equivalent degree in hand before 
beginning the fellowship, but may apply while completing the degree 
requirements. U. S. citizens, Lawful Permanent Residents, and foreign 
nationals eligible for J-1 status as a Research Scholar may apply.  
An H-1B Visa status is not acceptable because the NPP is not an 
employment program.

Stipends for Postdoctoral Fellows start at $50,000 per year, with 
moderate supplements for high cost-of-living areas and for certain 
academic specialties. Funds are available for relocation expenses, up 
to a specified limit, and health insurance is available through the 
program. Fellows also receive $8,000 per appointment year to support 
travel to conferences, meetings, and other activities that directly 
support their research.

Applications are accepted three times each year: March 1, July 1, 
and November 1.

USGS ASTROGEOLOGY ANNOUNCEMENT TO HIRE A NEW SCIENCE CENTER DIRECTOR

The incumbent serves as Director of the Astrogeology Science Center 
(ASTRO) in the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), and manages and directs 
all scientific activities therein.  The USGS ASTRO Science Center 
conducts the major segment of the USGS's program of scientific research 
into the geologic nature and history of the planets and satellites in 
the Solar System.  The program encompasses a variety of scientific and 
technical disciplines including geology, geophysics, computer science, 
cartography, geodesy, space science, physical science, and remote 
sensing. This interdisciplinary position may be classified in any of 
the following professional occupational series; General Physical 
Science GS-1301; Geophysics, GS-1313; Chemistry, GS-1320; Geology, 
GS-1350.  Astronomers and astrophysics will typically apply under 
General Physical Science (GS 13-01).

This opportunity closes 27 Jan 2012.

[NASA] PDS - LUNAR RECONNAISSANCE ORBITER DATA RELEASE 8

The NASA Planetary Data System is pleased to announce a new delivery 
of Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) data for the following 
instruments: CRaTER,  DLRE, LAMP, LEND, LOLA, LROC and Mini-RF.

In general, LRO Release 8 includes data collected between June 15 and 
September 14, 2011.

To access the above data, please visit the following link:

http://pds.nasa.gov/subscription_service/SS-20111215.html

PDS offers two services for searching the LRO archives:

The Planetary Image Atlas at the Imaging Node allows selection of LRO 
data by specific search criteria:

DEADLINE APPROACHING FOR THE LUNAR EXPLORATION SUMMER INTERN PROGRAM

The Lunar and Planetary Institute (LPI) is hosting a special summer
intern program to evaluate possible landing sites for robotic and human
exploration missions. The LPI invites applications from graduate
students in geology, planetary science, and related programs. The
program is also open to undergraduate students in geology, astronomy,
chemistry, and physics with at least 50 semester hours of credit so 
that they, too, can participate in lunar exploration activities. The 
goal of this program is to integrate NASA's lunar science priorities 
with the exploration components of the new exploration program that 
takes us beyond low-Earth orbit. 

The program runs from May 29, 2012, through August 3, 2012. Selected 
interns will receive a $5000.00 stipend to cover the costs associated 
with being in Houston for the duration of the program. Additionally, 
U.S. citizens will receive up to $1000.00 in travel expense 
reimbursement, and foreign nationals will receive up to $1500.00 in 
travel expense reimbursement.

Please pass this information on to any students who might be 
interested.

Application deadline: January 20, 2012

Applications are only accepted using the form at:
