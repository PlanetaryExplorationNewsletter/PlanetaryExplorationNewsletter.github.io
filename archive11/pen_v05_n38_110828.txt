CASSINI RADAR SCIENCE 

Cassini RADAR data users: note that Titan's rotation axis is now known
to be inclined to its orbital plane, reducing location errors from 10s
of km pre-Cassini to ~ 1-2 km. At present, two rotation models are 
used for RADAR products.  Flybys TA through T30 used a precessing/
nonsynchronous model that cannot be extrapolated.  T36 onward used the
same pole but synchronous rotation and no precession.  Users are 
warned that feature coordinates based on these two models are 
different at the 1-2 km level and that analyses such as stereoanalysis
and rotational modeling must take account.  Cassini may reprocess 
TA-T30 products to be consistent with later data and may reprocess 
all data once a definitive model exists.

Also, BIDR products may have parallax distortions resulting from 
topography.  BIDRs georeference onto a sphere, and features located
above or below appear displaced horizontally.  In particular, 
features in Titan's polar regions can be in error by 1-5 km, and 
the apparent offset between opposite-side images can be ~ 2-10 km. 
These differences can be exploited for stereomapping but also must
be accounted for in analyses such as change detection and rotation 
modeling).

EPSC-DPS meeting attendees are invited to an International Astronomical 
Union gathering ("IAU Party") on Wednesday 5 October from 12:00 to 
1:30pm to learn about and discuss the role of the IAU in the area of
(exo)planetary sciences:
   - what it is (Divisions, Commissions, Working Groups, etc.)
   - what it does
   - what you would like it to be/do

Application forms (due December 1, 2011) will be available for those
interested in becoming IAU members (required for attendance at next 
year's General Assembly in Beijing).

Box lunches will be available for purchase (cost is 17 euros).

THE NASA POSTDOCTORAL PROGRAM WELCOMES APPLICATIONS FOR THE NOVEMBER 
CYCLE
 
The next deadline to apply for a NASA Postdoctoral Program (NPP) 
fellowship is November 1, 2011.  These competitive one- to three-year
appointments advance NASA's missions in space science, earth science,
aeronautics, space operations, exploration systems, lunar science, 
and astrobiology.
 
Applicants must have a Ph.D. or equivalent degree in hand before 
beginning the fellowship, but may apply while completing the degree 
requirements. U. S. citizens and foreign nationals who hold Lawful 
Permanent Resident status or who are eligible for J-1 status as a 
Research Scholar may apply.  An H-1B Visa status is not acceptable 
because the NPP is not an employment program.
 
Stipend rates for Postdoctoral Fellows start at $50,000 per year, 
with moderate supplements for high cost-of-living areas and for 
certain academic specialties. Funds are available for relocation 
expenses, up to a specified limit, and health insurance is available 
through the program. Fellows also receive $8,000 per appointment year
to support travel to conferences, meetings, and other activities that
directly support their research.
 
Applications for the NASA Postdoctoral Program are accepted three 
times each year: March 1, July 1, and November 1.

fundamental cartographic and digital image processing of planetary data
using ISIS. The tentative course outline includes:

Basic visualization tools
ISIS GUI and utility tools
Importing data into ISIS
Camera and Photogrammetric tools
Map projecting images
Creating uncontrolled digital mosaics
Exporting data from ISIS
Co-registration of data sets
Photometric normalization tools
Advanced visualization tools

There is no fee for the workshop; however, all travel and lodging costs
are the responsibility of the attendee.

Registration: Please send an email to ssides@usgs.gov with a subject
line of "ISIS Workshop at JHU/APL". Attendees will be accepted on a

POSTDOCTORAL RESEARCHER: PETROLOGY OF PLANETARY MATERIALS

The Lunar and Planetary Institute (LPI), part of the Universities 
Space Research Association, invites applications for a postdoctoral 
fellowship in the petrology of planetary materials.

The successful candidate will work with Dr. Allan Treiman in NASA-
funded efforts, focusing on planetary crusts and magmas, and their 
volatiles constituents; target materials include lunar highlands 
rocks, Martian meteorites, and terrestrial analogs.  These efforts 
focus on planetary samples, starting with analyses by optical 
microscopy and electron microprobe; other instruments are available 
at nearby Johnson Space Center or with external collaborators.  The 
candidate will be encouraged to design and conduct their own research 
in planetary science, propose for external funding, participate in 
grant review panels and analysis groups, and become involved with 
spacecraft missions.

The successful candidate will have a recent Ph.D. in petrology or 
geochemistry; experience with planetary materials is helpful, but 
not required.  The position would be for two years, with possible 
extension to a third year.  Review of candidates will begin on 
November 15, 2011, with a hiring decision as soon as possible 
thereafter. Further information can be found on our website:

POSTDOCTORAL RESEARCHERS IN LUNAR SCIENCE

The Universities Space Research Association's Lunar and Planetary 
Institute (LPI) invites applications for lunar science and exploration 
postdoctoral fellowships.  Opportunities include:

Lunar Surface Geology and Remote Sensing - Using new LRO data; 
integrating it with existing lunar data to evaluate processes 
associated with impact cratering and/or planetary differentiation.  
Experience with orbital remote sensing methods, photometry of lunar 
materials, and photogeology of lunar or lunar-like terrains preferred. 

Experimental and/or Analytical Petrology and Geochemistry - Using 
Apollo and lunar meteorite samples (or synthetic analogues) to 
evaluate processes associated with impact cratering and/or planetary 
differentiation.  Experience with electron and ion microprobes, 
and/or LA-ICPMS techniques preferred.

Modeling of Impact Cratering Processes - Using hydrocodes and 
relevant analytical techniques to evaluate different cratering 
processes on the Moon, to model specific crater or basin-forming 
events, and potentially guide future exploration scenarios. 

The successful candidate will be a member of the new LPI-JSC Center
for Lunar Science and Exploration (http://www.lpi.usra.edu/nlsi/),
one of the core teams within the NASA Lunar Science Institute.
