THE NASA POSTDOCTORAL PROGRAM WELCOMES APPLICATIONS FOR THE NOVEMBER 
CYCLE

The next deadline to apply for a NASA Postdoctoral Program (NPP) 
fellowship is November 1, 2011.  These competitive one- to three-year 
appointments advance NASA's missions in space science, earth science, 
aeronautics, space operations, exploration systems, lunar science, and 
astrobiology.

Applicants must have a Ph.D. or equivalent degree in hand before 
beginning the fellowship, but may apply while completing the degree 
requirements. U. S. citizens and foreign nationals who hold Lawful 
Permanent Resident status or who are eligible for J-1 status as a 
Research Scholar may apply.  An H-1B Visa status is not acceptable 
because the NPP is not an employment program.

Stipend rates for Postdoctoral Fellows start at $50,000 per year, 
with moderate supplements for high cost-of-living areas and for certain 
academic specialties. Funds are available for relocation expenses, up 
to a specified limit, and health insurance is available through the 
program.  Fellows also receive $8,000 per appointment year to support 
travel to conferences, meetings, and other activities that directly 
support their research.

[NASA] TWO WEEK DELAY OF PROPOSAL DUE DATES

In order to give more time to proposers who are without power because 
of Hurricane Irene, the proposal due date for the following programs
are delayed by two weeks:

The Planetary Protection Research (PPR) program in Planetary Science. 
The new proposal due date is now Friday, September 16, 2011.

The Cross Division Supplemental Outreach and Education Programs, 
respectively. 
The new proposal due dates 6 are now Friday, September 16, 2011.

Questions concerning the Planetary Protection Research Program, may be 
addressed to Catharine Conley at HQ-PPR@mail.nasa.gov or 202-358-3912.

Questions concerning the Supplemental Outreach and Education Awards for

POSTDOCTORAL RESEARCHERS IN LUNAR SCIENCE

The Universities Space Research Association's Lunar and Planetary 
Institute (LPI) invites applications for lunar science and exploration 
postdoctoral fellowships.  Opportunities include:

Lunar Surface Geology and Remote Sensing - Using new LRO data; 
integrating it with existing lunar data to evaluate processes 
associated with impact cratering and/or planetary differentiation.  
Experience with orbital remote sensing methods, photometry of lunar 
materials, and photogeology of lunar or lunar-like terrains preferred. 

Experimental and/or Analytical Petrology and Geochemistry - Using 
Apollo and lunar meteorite samples (or synthetic analogues) to evaluate 
processes associated with impact cratering and/or planetary 
differentiation.  Experience with electron and ion microprobes, and/or 
LA-ICPMS techniques preferred.

Modeling of Impact Cratering Processes - Using hydrocodes and relevant 
analytical techniques to evaluate different cratering processes on the 
Moon, to model specific crater or basin-forming events, and potentially 
guide future exploration scenarios. 

The successful candidate will be a member of the new LPI-JSC Center for 
Lunar Science and Exploration (http://www.lpi.usra.edu/nlsi/), one of 
the core teams within the NASA Lunar Science Institute. 
           
Further information, including submission requirements are found at:

POSTDOCTORAL RESEARCHER: PETROLOGY OF PLANETARY MATERIALS

The Lunar and Planetary Institute (LPI), part of the Universities Space 
Research Association, invites applications for a postdoctoral 
fellowship in the petrology of planetary materials.

The successful candidate will work with Dr. Allan Treiman in 
NASA-funded efforts, focusing on planetary crusts and magmas, and their 
volatiles constituents; target materials include lunar highlands rocks, 
Martian meteorites, and terrestrial analogs.  These efforts focus on 
planetary samples, starting with analyses by optical microscopy and 
electron microprobe; other instruments are available at nearby Johnson 
Space Center or with external collaborators.  The candidate will be 
encouraged to design and conduct their own research in planetary 
science, propose for external funding, participate in grant review 
panels and analysis groups, and become involved with spacecraft 
missions.

The successful candidate will have a recent Ph.D. in petrology or 
geochemistry; experience with planetary materials is helpful, but not 
required.  The position would be for two years, with possible extension 
to a third year.  Review of candidates will begin on November 15, 2011, 
with a hiring decision as soon as possible thereafter. Further 
information can be found on our website:

APPLICATION DEADLINE FOR EUGENE M SHOEMAKER IMPACT CRATERING AWARD

Dear Colleagues,

A reminder -

Applications for the GSA Planetary Science Division's Eugene M. 
Shoemaker Impact Cratering Award are due September 9, 2011.

The Eugene M. Shoemaker Impact Cratering Award is for undergraduate 
or graduate students, of any nationality, working in any country, 
in the disciplines of geology, geophysics, geochemistry, astronomy, 
or biology. The award, which will include $2500, is to be applied 
for the study of impact craters, either on Earth or on the other 
solid bodies in the solar system. Areas of study may include but 
shall not necessarily be limited to impact cratering processes; the 
bodies (asteroidal or cometary) that make the impacts; or the 
geological, chemical, or biological results of impact cratering. 
Details about the award as well as an application form for interested 
students can be found at:

TITAN THROUGH TIME II WORKSHOP, APRIL 3-5, 2012

NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt, MD

We are pleased to announce the dates for the second workshop on 
"Titan Through Time: Formation, Evolution and Fate" in 2012, following 
the very successful first workshop in 2010. The second meeting will 
have a similar format, with a 2 1/2 science program comprised of 
themed sessions, and featuring a mixture of invited reviews, and 
contributed talks and posters.

As in 2010, we welcome scientific reports and attendance from the 
widest possible cross-section of the scientific community, including 
both those studying Titan directly, but also those whose research 
interests have intersections with Titan science in areas such as 
laboratory chemistry and spectroscopy; modeling of planetary 
atmospheres, surfaces and interiors; terrestrial analogs and 
comparative planetology; and the formation and evolution of the 
solar system.

Further details including the program of invited talks will be
publicized in due course. A link to the website (when available) can 
be booked-marked here:
