WORKSHOP: COLD TEMPERATURE TECHNOLOGY APPLICATIONS FOR EXPLORING THE
LUNAR SURFACE AND SEARCHING FOR VOLATILES

This cross-disciplinary workshop, to be held just prior to the Lunar 
and Planetary Science Conference and open to a broad cross-section of 
scientists, technology implementers and developers, will describe the 
nature of breakthroughs in the development of Low Temperature 
Technologies that could support operation below 100 K and are thus 
essential for exploration of the lunar (and other planetary) surfaces, 
particularly polar or permanently shadowed regions where prevailing 
cryogenic conditions would allow entrapment and thus characterization 
and collection of volatiles. Technologies includeHigh Temperature 
Superconductors for Materials and Mechanisms, Ultra Low temperature 
Ultra Low Power Electronics and Cold Temperature Power System 
Components. Advanced concepts for instrument packages and missions 
requiring cold temperature operation will be discussed. For more

ABGRADCON 2011 - ABSTRACT SUBMISSIONS ARE NOW OPEN!

The 7th Annual AbGradCon (Astrobiology Graduate Conference) will be 
held at the University of Montana, Bozeman MT on June 4th-8th.

AbGradCon (Astrobiology Graduate Conference) provides a unique setting 
for astrobiologically inclined graduate students and early career 
researchers to come together to share their research, collaborate, and 
network.  Since it is organized and attended by only graduate students 
and post docs, AbGradCon is an ideal venue for the next generation of 
career astrobiologists to form bonds, share ideas, and discuss the 
issues that will shape the future of the field.

Abstracts are requested on all subjects related to Astrobiology. This 
includes, but is not limited to, geomicrobiology, molecular biology, 
oceanography, atmospheric science, instrumentation, mission design, 
origin & evolution of life, remote sensing, planetary science, 
astrophysics, education & public outreach and policy. 

Full funding is available for US applicants. Limited funding may be 
available for international students. Please contact us if you have 
any questions regarding funding.

Deadline for Abstract Submission: February 28, 2011
Participant Notification: April 4th, 2011

SECOND ANNOUNCEMENT: CONFERENCE ON MARS HABITABILITY

We are pleased that the announcement and the call for papers is now 
online at: 

http://www.congrex.nl/11a14/

The conference will be held at the Tivoli Lisboa, Lisbon, Portugal, on 
June 13-15, 2011.  The conference will begin after lunch on Monday, 
June 13, and will run for 2.5 days through the end of the day on 
Wednesday, June 15.  The conference will be immediately followed by 
the first International Mars Exploration Program Analysis Group meeting 
(MEPAG #24), June 16-17 at the same venue.  All participants in the 
Habitability Conference are strongly encouraged to stay for the MEPAG 
meeting.  Finally, a post-meeting field trip to the important Mars 
analog site at Rio Tinto, Spain, is planned for June 17-19.  
 
Note that the abstract deadline is February 11, 2011.
 
We hope to see you in beautiful Lisboa in June!

TRAINING WORKSHOPS ON VENUS EXPRESS AND MARS EXPRESS SCIENCE DATA

ESA is planning a data workshop related to the Mars Express and Venus 
Express instruments PFS, SPICAMand SPICAV/SOIR for summer 2011 
(June / July), at ESAC in Spain.  There are several options for this 
and we would like to gauge interest in the following possibilities:

1) 1 week Mars Express 'atmosphere' workshop:
- PFS data
- SPICAM UV and IR data
Required: knowledge of IDL.

2) 3 days Venus Express workshop:
- SPICAV UV and IR data
- SPICAV-SOIR data
Required: knowledge of IDL and Matlab.

3) 1.5 week Mars Express / Venus Express workshop:
- PFS data
- SPICAM / SPICAV UV and IR data
- SPICAV-SOIR data
N.B. This would require students to stay over a weekend.
Required: knowledge of IDL and Matlab.

If you are interested in attending a workshop in summer 2011, please 
send us an e-mail (dataworkshops@rssd.esa.int) with the following 
information:

- Name
- Institution
- Level: student, PhD, Post doc, ...
- Interest / preference for which workshop: 1) PFS and SPICAM, 2) 
SPICAV and SPICAV-SOIR, 3) PFS, SPICAM and SPICAV combined (would 
require a weekend stay)

Deadline: 3rd February 2011

OUTER PLANETS COLLOQUIUM SERIES

Would your institution like a visit and colloquium presentation from 
an expert in outer solar system science, at no expense to you?  Would 
you like travel support to share your outer solar system research?  
Presenters and host institutions are sought for the Outer Planets 
Colloquium Series, a program that matches planetary scientists with 
university campuses and research institutions.

Participation is open to two- and four-year undergraduate colleges and 
research institutions throughout the United States. Host institutions 
commit to making the necessary local arrangements.  Presenters are 
encouraged to address the needs of the next generation of scientists 
(graduate students, interns, and undergraduates) and to give an 
additional presentation that is free and open to the general public. 
Other interactions that increase awareness of outer solar system 
science may also be considered as part of the visit. These may include 
guest teaching a class, interacting informally with students 
and faculty, or other outreach activities.

A current list of presenters and their prospective talks is provided 
on the Series website.  

The Colloquium Series will cover the presenter's travel expenses.  
There will be no honorarium for the speaker.

Application details and further information may be found at:
