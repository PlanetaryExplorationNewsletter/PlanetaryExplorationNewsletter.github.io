[NASA] DUE DATE DELAYED FOR LUNAR ADVANCED SCIENCE AND EXPLORATION 
RESEARCH (LASER) PROGRAM

The Lunar Advanced Science and Exploration Research (LASER) program 
funds basic and applied lunar science. It is the objective of the 
LASER program to conduct a suite of lunar science investigations 
spanning the continuum from basic science to applied exploration 
science. Proposals having significant components of both basic and 
applied lunar science that further our understanding of the Moon and 
how to conduct science there are sought and highly encouraged. The 
LASER program also welcomes the submission of data restoration 
proposals. The program seeks to identify science data archives that 
are considered of significant value to lunar science that are in need 
of restoration and digital archiving. 

The proposal due date for LASER has been changed to February 24, 2011. 
This is to defer the LASER proposal due date until after the next 
delivery of Moon Mineralogy Mapper (M3) data to the Planetary Data 
System (PDS). 

Questions concerning LASER may be addressed to

[NASA] ANNOUNCES THE EXPERIMENTAL PROGRAM TO STIMULATE COMPETITIVE 
RESEARCH (EPSCoR)

The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has released 
the FY 2011 Research Announcement for the NASA Experimental Program to 
Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR). Each funded NASA EPSCoR
proposal is expected to establish research activities that will make 
significant contributions to the strategic research and technology 
development priorities of one or more of NASA's four Mission 
Directorates - Aeronautics Research, Exploration Systems, Science, and 
Space Operations, the Office of the Chief Technologist (OCT), and 
NASA's ten Centers and contribute to the overall research 
infrastructure, science and technology capabilities, higher education, 
and economic development of the proposing jurisdiction.  

The National Science Foundation (NSF) determines overall jurisdiction 
eligibility for NASA EPSCoR.  The following NASA EPSCoR jurisdictions 
may respond to this NASA EPSCoR solicitation: Alabama, Alaska, 
Arkansas, Delaware, Hawaii, Idaho, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, 
Maine, Mississippi, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Hampshire, 
New Mexico, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Puerto Rico, Rhode Island, 
South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Utah, Vermont, West Virginia, 
and Wyoming. Jurisdictions responding to this CAN may submit up to two 
proposals.

JOB OPENING - LUNAR SAMPLE CURATOR 

January 5 through January 26, 2011
Vacancy number:   JS11B0022
Level:   GS-14
 
The Astromaterials Research and Exploration Science Directorate (ARES) 
at NASA Johnson Space Center (JSC) invites applications to a civil 
service position in Planetary Science in the Astromaterials Acquisition 
and Curation Office.  The successful applicant will serve as Lunar 
Sample Curator.  Responsibilities include overseeing the preservation, 
protection, and distribution of NASA's Apollo lunar samples; the safe 
operation of the Lunar Sample Laboratory Facility at JSC and the 
Curation Remote Storage Facility at the White Sands Test Facility; as 
well as providing overall technical insight into the development and 
management of policies, procedures, and operational schedules necessary 
for lunar sample curation.  The successful applicant will also be 
encouraged to conduct their own fundamental research in planetary 
science and to support mission planning for exploration of solar 
system objects.

A DECADE OF EXPLORATION WITH THE MAGELLAN TELESCOPES

April 25-28, 2011
The Huntington Library
Pasadena, CA

The twin 6.5 meter Magellan telescopes in Chile are widely considered 
among the best natural seeing telescopes in the world consistently 
delivering high quality images over extended periods of time. In their 
first decade of operations, the telescopes have made important 
contributions to many areas of astrophysics and cosmology including 
dark energy, dark matter, early galaxies, IGM, AGN and quasars, 
clusters of galaxies, the Milky Way and Local Group galaxies, 
extrasolar planets and the Solar System. This three day meeting will 
highlight scientific results from the telescopes and prospects for 
future science with the next generation of instruments.

We are also taking advantage of this opportunity to celebrate the 
accomplishments of Dr. Stephen Shectman who played a central role 
in the design and construction of the telescopes and continues to play 
a major role in the development of Magellan instrumentation. Some of 
Dr. Shectman's many contributions to astronomy will be described in 
a dinner in his honor held on the second day of the meeting.

Deadline for abstract submission for talks and posters is 
March 1, 2011. For more information, please visit:

[NASA] FINAL REPORT FROM THE JOINT JUPITER SCIENCE DEFINITION TEAM

The final report from the Joint Jupiter Science Definition Team (JJSDT) 
for the Europa Jupiter System Mission (EJSM) is now available on the 
OPAG website: 

http://www.lpi.usra.edu/opag/ 

The EJSM consists of two spacecraft, the Jupiter Europa Orbiter 
(contributed by NASA) and the Jupiter Ganymede Orbiter (contributed 
by ESA). Over the past year the JJSDT has worked to finalize their 
definition of the EJSM science objectives, investigations, and 
measurements for the mission.  The JJSDT is now disbanded, and NASA is 
taking their report into consideration as it makes plans for the 
Jupiter Europa Orbiter.
