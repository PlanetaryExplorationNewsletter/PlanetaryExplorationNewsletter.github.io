NOTICE OF ROSES-2011 RELEASE

NASA will be calling for proposals on a wide range of basic and 
applied supporting research and technology in space and Earth sciences, 
from data analysis, experiments and observations to theory, fieldwork, 
aircraft, stratospheric balloon, suborbital rocket, and commercial 
reusable rocket investigations. From the development of concepts, 
techniques, and technologies for future SMD space missions and the 
laboratory analysis extraterrestrial samples to Earth surface 
observations and development of models and methods for applying Earth 
science research data to societal needs.

The targeted release date of the Research Opportunities in Space and
Earth Sciences (ROSES) solicitation is delayed to February 18, 2011 
and will be viewable at:

http://nspires.nasaprs.com/ 
(select "Solicitations" then "Open Solicitations" and "NNH11ZDA001N"

The reason for the delay is that the president's budget for FY 2012 
will not be released until mid February and ROSES 2011 projects will be 
supported with FY 2012 funds, so we have delayed our planned release 
date to come out after the president's budget for FY 2012.

PGGURP SEEKS RESEARCHERS TO HOST UNDERGRADUATE SUMMER INTERNS

The Planetary Geology and Geophysics Undergraduate Research Program 
(PGGURP) pairs qualified undergraduates with NASA-funded PIs for 
approximately 8 weeks during the summer. Preference is given to PIs 
with active funding from the Planetary Geology and Geophysics (PGG) 
program.

PGGURP will pay: the student's travel to and from your home 
institution; housing for the student; a cost-of-living stipend; and 
funds to help the intern present their research at a national 
conference. The PI helps locate suitable housing, and guides the 
student throughout the project.

The optimal duration of the internship is 8 weeks. The PI and intern 
determine the precise start- and end-dates.

If you are interested in hosting an intern, please email me by Feb. 25 
with the following information:

1) A summary of the project(s) in which the intern might participate;

2) A list of essential skills that the student must possess (e.g., must 
have 2 years of undergraduate physics; GIS experience);

3) A list of favorable skills (e.g., GIS experience preferable but not 
required).

Please feel free to email me with questions (tgregg@buffalo.edu); you 
can also see our website at:

LUNAR SWIRLS LUNCH-TIME MEETING AT LPSC, MONDAY, MARCH 7, 2011
 
You're invited to participate in an informal lunch-time meeting to 
discuss recent advances in the study of lunar swirls. The meeting will 
be held at LPSC on Monday, March 7, 2011 between 12:30 and 1:30 p.m. in 
the Alden Bridge Room, Woodlands Waterway Marriott Hotel and Convention 
Center, Woodlands, Texas. Please bring your own lunch.
 
The goal of this meeting is to bring together interested parties to 
foster new collaborations in the understanding of the lunar swirls. We 
particularly encourage participation from those with an interest in 
analyzing measurements from recent orbital missions. We intend an open 
discussion and exchange of ideas, and therefore encourage participation 
from proponents of all of the different swirl formation hypotheses.

Catherine Neish (catherine.neish@jhuapl.edu), 
or Sebastien Besse (sbesse@astro.umd.edu).

INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON EXPLORING MARS HABITABILITY DEADLINE 
EXTENSION

The abstract deadline for the International Conference on Exploring 
Mars Habitability (June 13-15, Lisbon, Portugal) was originally 
announced as February 11, 2011, but this has now been extended by 10 
days, to Monday, February 21, 2011.  For interested members of the 
community, the conference information, including the abstract 
submission web site, can be found at:

The first information circular, including a draft agenda, for the first 
international MEPAG meeting (June 16-17) has been made available and is

NASA PLANETARY SCIENCE SUMMER SCHOOL APPLICATIONS 

NASA is accepting applications from science and engineering post-docs, 
recent PhDs, and doctoral students for its 23rd Annual Planetary 
Science Summer School, which will hold two separate sessions this 
summer (18-22 July and 1-5 August) at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in 
Pasadena, Calif. During the program and pre-session webinars, student 
teams will carry out the equivalent of an early mission concept study, 
prepare a proposal authorization review presentation, present it to a 
review board, and receive feedback. By the end of the session, 
students will have a clearer understanding of the life cycle of a space 
mission; relationships between mission design, cost, and schedule; and 
the tradeoffs necessary to stay within cost and schedule while 
preserving the quality of science. Applications are due April 1st, 2011. 
Partial financial support is available for a limited number of 
individuals. Further information is available at:

COLD TEMPERATURE TECHNOLOGY APPLICATIONS FOR EXPLORING THE LUNAR 
SURFACE AND SEARCHING FOR VOLATILES

This cross-disciplinary workshop, to be held just prior to the Lunar 
and Planetary Science Conference and open to a broad cross-section of 
scientists, technology implementers and developers, will describe the 
nature of breakthroughs in the development of Low Temperature 
Technologies that could support operation below 100 K and are thus 
essential for exploration of the lunar (and other planetary) surfaces, 
particularly polar or permanently shadowed regions where prevailing 
cryogenic conditions would allow entrapment and thus characterization 
and collection of volatiles. Technologies include High Temperature 
Superconductors for Materials and Mechanisms, Ultra Low temperature 
Ultra Low Power Electronics and Cold Temperature Power System 
Components.  Advanced concepts for instrument packages and missions 
requiring cold temperature operation will be discussed. For more 
information go to:
