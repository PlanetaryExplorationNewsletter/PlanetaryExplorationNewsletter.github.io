[NASA] LUNAR SCIENCE FORUM:  FINAL ANNOUNCEMENT

The abstract deadline for the 4th annual NASA Lunar Science Forum, to 
be held July 19-21, 2011 at NASA Ames Research Center in Moffett Field, 
CA, has been extended to May 13.

Registration for the Forum is FREE and will remain open until June 
30th.  Please register early.  International visitors MUST register by 
June 5th, 2011 in order to process your NASA visitor information.

This year's forum will feature sessions on in-depth scientific results 
from the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter and Lunar Crater Observation and 
Sensing Satellite, a dedicated side-conference for graduate students 
and young lunar professionals, as well as the annual recognition of 
scientific accomplishments and associated keynote lecture.  As in past 
years, science sessions are structured to report on both recent results 
and future opportunities for lunar science, exploration, education and 
outreach. We also look forward to news on the upcoming lunar missions 
GRAIL and LADEE, and welcome abstracts across the many fields of lunar 
science.

For more details, please visit:

http://lunarscience2011.arc.nasa.gov

We look forward to another exciting meeting focusing on science of, on 
and from the Moon!

FIRST ANNOUNCEMENT: NEXT GENERATION LUNAR SCIENTISTS AND ENGINEERS 
WORKSHOP - MONDAY, JULY 18 - AMES RESEARCH CENTER

The Next Generation Lunar Scientists and Engineers (NGLSE) group is 
now accepting applications for its upcoming workshop on Monday, July 18 
prior to the NASA Lunar Science Forum at Ames Research Center.  The 
day-long workshop will feature media training by Emmy Award winner 
George Merlis, a former executive producer of Good Morning America, the 
CBS Morning News, and Entertainment Tonight.  Media training was 
identified as a topic of interest to NGLSE members in a recent survey.  
In addition to media training, participants will have the opportunity 
to meet and network with their peers and established members of the 
lunar community.  

Space is limited to 25 participants.  Small travel stipends are 
available on a first-come, first-served basis as well.  The 
registration form can be downloaded at: 

http://nextgenlunar.arc.nasa.gov/?q=lsf2011  

Please return completed registration forms to Lora Bleacher 
(Lora.V.Bleacher@nasa.gov) by May 31.

FINAL MARS SCIENCE LABORATORY (MSL) LANDING SITE WORKSHOP

Dear Colleague:
The fifth and final landing site workshop for the 2011 Mars Science 
Laboratory (MSL) mission will be held May 16-18, 2011, at the 
DoubleTree Hotel in Monrovia, California.  All members of the 
scientific community are encouraged to participate in this important 
activity.

The program for the workshop is posted at: 

http://marsoweb.nas.nasa.gov/landingsites/ 

and 

http://webgis.wr.usgs.gov/msl/

The meeting will be broadcast via WebEx and information on how to 
access the workshop will be posted at these same websites just prior 
to the workshop. 

Input from the science community is critical to identifying the optimal 
landing site for the MSL. We look forward to your continued 
involvement!
 
Sincerely,

ASTROBIOLOGY-PLANETARY SCIENCE IMAGE COLLECTION NOW AVAILABLE

Celebrating NASA's Year of the Solar System, From Earth to the Solar 
System (FETTSS) is a collection of high resolution images that showcase 
the beauty and excitement of planetary explorationâ€”our journey to 
understand the origin and evolution of the Solar System, and our search 
for life elsewhere.

FETTSS is freely available to organizations worldwide.  You can 
download the high-resolution images for free, and print and display 
however many you choose, wherever you choose, and in any format you 
choose!  

Tips for success and links to the Twitter feed and Facebook page are 
on the website: 

http://fettss.arc.nasa.gov

The images are at once artistic and informative, weaving together 
themes in astrobiology, planetary science, and astronomy. Including 
contributions from backyard astronomers, large telescopes in space, 
and even point-and-shoot cameras of field researchers, the collection 
represents the current state of exploration as seen through the eyes 
of the scientific community.  Thanks to all who contributed to the 
collection!

SECOND ANNUAL LUNAGRADCON 2011

The 2nd Annual Lunar Graduate Conference (LunGradCon 2011) will be held 
on Sunday, July 17, 2011 at the NASA Ames Research Center (ARC), 
preceding the NASA Lunar Science Forum. LunGradCon provides an 
opportunity for grad students and early-career postdocs to present 
their research on lunar science in a low-stress, friendly environment, 
being critiqued only by their peers. In addition to oral presentations, 
the conference presents opportunities for networking with fellow grad 
students and postdocs, as well as senior members of the NASA Lunar 
Science Institute. A limited amount of funding will be provided for 
travel and lodging costs.
