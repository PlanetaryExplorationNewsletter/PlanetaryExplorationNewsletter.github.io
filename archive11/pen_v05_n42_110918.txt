EXOCLIMES 2012: THE DIVERSITY OF PLANETARY ATMOSPHERES

Jan 16-20, 2012
Aspen Center for Physics (Aspen, CO)
exoclimes.org

Exoplanetary atmospheres have recently become accessible to
observations.  What observations are possible in the foreseeable 
future? And how will they constrain the climate on other worlds?  
Our goal is to bring together Earth, Solar System and Exoplanet 
researchers to discuss a variety of aspects of climate science.

Confirmed Speakers:
Fran Bagenal (U of Colorado) - planetary magnetic fields
Christiane Helling (St. Andrews) - atmospheric dust
David Catling (U of Washington) - the history of Earth's atmosphere
Adrian Lenardic (Rice U) - geodynamics
Mark Marley (NASA Ames) - clouds
John Marshall (MIT) - ocean dynamics
Ray Pierrehumbert (U of Chicago) - climate system modeling
Tapio Schneider (Caltech) - terrestrial planet atmospheric dynamics
Adam Showman (U of Arizona) - giant planet atmospheric dynamics
Remi Soummer (STScI) - direct imaging observations

OUTER PLANETS ASSESSMENT GROUP (OPAG) URANUS WORKING GROUP  

We will be meeting October 17 and 18 in Pasadena, just prior to the 
full OPAG meeting.  Please see:

http://www.lpi.usra.edu/opag/ 

for hotel and location information.  Note that hotel reservations 
should be made as soon as possible to obtain the group rate.  

Our charter is to assess and coordinate Earth-based observing 
campaigns to best address Uranus science questions.  Note that 
"Uranus science" includes all aspects of the uranian system, 
including the planet, rings, satellites, and magnetosphere.  Purely 
theoretical efforts are relevant, as they guide or allow 
interpretation of observations.

To receive e-mail announcements about the Uranus Working Group, or 
if you have any questions, please contact Mark.Hofstadter@jpl.nasa.gov

[NASA] CONCEPTS FOR THE NEXT NASA X-RAY ASTRONOMY MISSION

Solicitation number: NNH11ZDA018L
Release Date:  September 13, 2011
Response Date:  October 28, 2011

NASA is seeking information that can be used to develop concepts that 
meet some or all of the scientific objectives of the International 
X ray Observatory (IXO).  Information being sought includes relevant 
mission concepts, instrument concepts, enabling technologies, or any 
aspect of flight, ground or launch systems architecture.

Through this Request for Information (RFI), NASA is seeking 
information relevant to an X-ray astronomy mission concept or mission
concepts that will satisfy some or all the scientific objectives 
listed in Table 1.  The RFI also requests standalone instrument 
concepts as well as relevant key enabling technologies for such 
missions or instruments.  Mission concepts should range in cost from
~ $300M to $2,000M in FY12 dollars.

POSTDOCTORAL RESEARCHER IN PETROLOGY OF PLANETARY MATERIALS

The Lunar and Planetary Institute (LPI), part of the Universities 
Space Research Association, invites applications for a postdoctoral 
fellowship in the petrology of planetary materials.

The successful candidate will work with Dr. Allan Treiman in NASA-
funded efforts, focusing on planetary crusts and magmas, and their 
volatiles constituents; target materials include lunar highlands 
rocks, Martian meteorites, and terrestrial analogs.  These efforts 
focus on planetary samples, starting with analyses by optical 
microscopy and electron microprobe; other instruments are available 
at nearby Johnson Space Center or with external collaborators.  The 
candidate will be encouraged to design and conduct their own research 
in planetary science, propose for external funding, participate in 
grant review panels and analysis groups, and become involved with 
spacecraft missions.

The successful candidate will have a recent Ph.D. in petrology or 
geochemistry; experience with planetary materials is helpful, but 
not required.  The position would be for two years, with possible 
extension to a third year.  Review of candidates will begin on 
November 15, 2011, with a hiring decision as soon as possible 
thereafter. Further information can be found on our website:

http://www.lpi.usra.edu.

The Universities Space Research Association is an Equal Opportunity 
Employer.

POSTDOCTORAL RESEARCHERS IN LUNAR SCIENCE

The Universities Space Research Association's Lunar and Planetary 
Institute (LPI) invites applications for lunar science and exploration
postdoctoral fellowships.  Opportunities include:

Lunar Surface Geology and Remote Sensing - Using new LRO data; 
integrating it with existing lunar data to evaluate processes 
associated with impact cratering and/or planetary differentiation. 
Experience with orbital remote sensing methods, photometry of lunar
materials, and photogeology of lunar or lunar-like terrains preferred. 

Experimental and/or Analytical Petrology and Geochemistry - Using 
Apollo and lunar meteorite samples (or synthetic analogues) to 
evaluate processes associated with impact cratering and/or planetary 
differentiation.  Experience with electron and ion microprobes, 
and/or LA-ICPMS techniques preferred.

Modeling of Impact Cratering Processes - Using hydrocodes and relevant
analytical techniques to evaluate different cratering processes on the
Moon, to model specific crater or basin-forming events, and potentially
guide future exploration scenarios. 

The successful candidate will be a member of the new LPI-JSC Center 
for Lunar Science and Exploration (http://www.lpi.usra.edu/nlsi/), 
one of the core teams within the NASA Lunar Science Institute. 
           
Further information, including submission requirements are found at:

THE NASA POSTDOCTORAL PROGRAM

The next deadline to apply for a NASA Postdoctoral Program (NPP) 
fellowship is November 1, 2011.  These competitive one- to three-year
appointments advance NASA's missions in space science, earth science,
aeronautics, space operations, exploration systems, lunar science, and
astrobiology.

Applicants must have a Ph.D. or equivalent degree in hand before 
beginning the fellowship, but may apply while completing the degree 
requirements. U. S. citizens and foreign nationals who hold Lawful 
Permanent Resident status or who are eligible for J-1 status as a 
Research Scholar may apply.  An H-1B Visa status is not acceptable 
because the NPP is not an employment program.

Stipend rates for Postdoctoral Fellows start at $50,000 per year, 
with moderate supplements for high cost-of-living areas and for 
certain academic specialties. Funds are available for relocation 
expenses, up to a specified limit, and health insurance is available
through the program. Fellows also receive $8,000 per appointment 
year to support travel to conferences, meetings, and other activities
that directly support their research.

Applications for the NASA Postdoctoral Program are accepted: 
March 1, July 1, and November 1.
