EXPLORING THE PLANETARY SCIENCE ACHIEVABLE FROM A BALLOON-BASED
OBSERVATORY

Can new capabilities in high altitude balloons open the door for new 
planetary science? Could this platform achieve high-value science, 
offer more flight opportunities, and at drastically lower costs?

These, and similar questions will be explored in an upcoming workshop,  
Exploring the Planetary Science Achievable from a Balloon-Based 
Observatory, at the NASA Glenn Research Center on January 25-26, 2012  
in Cleveland Ohio.

The primary purpose of the workshop is to determine the level of 
planetary science support there may be for a balloon-based planetary 
observatory.  Balloon platform SOA will be presented. PIs will 
provide highlights and share experiences from recent missions. 
Following the informative sessions, break out panels will explore the 
science that can be achieved.

More information will be available and questions will be answered 
during a virtual meeting scheduled for November 16, 2011 at 11AM 
Eastern. Please see details at:

POSTDOCTORAL FELLOWSHIPS AT ASU-SESE

The School of Earth and Space Exploration (SESE) at Arizona State 
University invites applications for the Exploration Postdoctoral 
Fellowship Program. This program provides opportunities for 
postdoctoral research on cutting-edge topics with an emphasis on 
inter-disciplinary collaboration. Research areas within SESE 
encompass theoretical and observational astronomy, cosmology, 
astrobiology, earth sciences, climate science, planetary sciences, 
exploration systems engineering, astronomical instrumentation and 
science education.

Applications must include a brief research proposal that has been 
discussed with two prospective faculty mentors at ASU. Potential 
research topics span the full range of research interests of our 
faculty: 

http://sese.asu.edu/focus_areas 

When a topic of mutual interest is identified, the applicant will 
prepare and submit a 5-8 page research proposal.

A full description of the application process is found at: 

http://sese.asu.edu/opportunities 

Applications are due by December 31, 2011 and three reference letters 
by January 5, 2012 via email to exppd@asu.edu. We expect to award up 
to 2 fellowships. These 2-year appointments will typically start 
between July 1 and September 1, 2012. Evaluation of applications 
begins January 1, 2012. Decisions will be announced in early February.

ASU is an equal opportunity/affirmative action employer that actively 
seeks diversity among applicants and promotes a diverse workforce.

[NASA] EARTH AND SPACE SCIENCE FELLOWSHIP (NESSF) PROGRAM

This call for fellowship proposals solicits applications from 
accredited U.S. universities on behalf of individuals pursuing Master 
of Science (M.Sc.) or Doctoral (Ph.D.) degrees in Earth and space 
sciences, or related disciplines.  The purpose of NESSF is to ensure 
continued training of a highly qualified workforce in disciplines 
needed to achieve NASA's scientific goals.  Awards resulting from the 
competitive selection will be made in the form of training grants to 
the respective universities.

The deadline for NEW applications is February 1, 2012, and the deadline 
for RENEWAL applications is March 15, 2012.

Instructions are found at:

http://nspires.nasaprs.com/ 

click on "Solicitations" then "Open Solicitations" then "NESSF 12".  
Also refer to "Proposal Submission Instructions" and "Frequently Asked 
Questions" listed under "Other Documents" on the NESSF 12 solicitation

[NASA] POSTDOCTORAL FELLOWSHIPS

The NASA Postdoctoral Program (NPP) offers scientists and engineers 
unique opportunities to conduct research at NASA Centers. Each NPP 
fellowship opportunity is designed to advance NASA research in a 
specific project related to space science, earth science, aeronautics, 
space operations, exploration systems, lunar science, or astrobiology.

Applicants must have a Ph.D. or equivalent degree in hand before 
beginning the fellowship, but may apply while completing the degree 
requirements. U. S. citizens and foreign nationals who hold Lawful 
Permanent Resident status or who are eligible for J-1 status as a 
Research Scholar may apply.  An H-1B Visa status is not acceptable 
because the NPP is not an employment program.

Stipends for Postdoctoral Fellows start at $50,000 per year, with 
moderate supplements for high cost-of-living areas and for certain 
academic specialties. Funds are available for relocation expenses, up 
to a specified limit, and health insurance is available through the 
program. Fellows also receive $8,000 per appointment year to support 
travel to conferences, meetings, and other activities that directly 
support their research.

Applications for the NASA Postdoctoral Program are accepted: March 1, 
July 1, and November 1.

GILBERT AWARD NOMINATIONS SOUGHT

Please consider nominating one of your peers in the planetary 
geosciences for the 2012 G. K. Gilbert award offered by the Planetary 
Geology Division of the Geological Society of America.

The G. K. Gilbert Award is presented annually for outstanding 
contributions to the solution of fundamental problems in planetary 
geology in the broadest sense, which includes geochemistry, 
mineralogy, petrology, geophysics, geologic mapping, and remote 
sensing. Such contributions may consist either of a single 
outstanding publication or a series of publications that have had great 
influence in the field. The award is named for the pioneering geologist 
G. K. Gilbert.

The award consists of an engraved plaque and an appropriate 
certificate, which is recommended by the management board of the 
Division, and approved by the GSA Council. A person selected by and 
familiar with the Recipient's work presents a citation reviewing the 
contributions of the Recipient.

The nomination deadline for the G. K. Gilbert Award is December 1, 
2011.  Nominations should be sent directly to PGD Past Chair, 
David Williams (david.williams@asu.edu). Electronic submissions are 
preferred.

With thanks,

RFI RELEASED ON PUBLIC ACCESS TO FEDERALLY FUNDED RESEARCH

In the Federal Register today the White House Office for Science and
Technology Policy (OSTP) released two requests for information 
regarding increasing public Access to results of federally funded 
research:

1. Request for Information: Public Access to Peer-Reviewed Scholarly
Publications Resulting From Federally Funded Research

and

2. Request for Information: Public Access to Digital Data Resulting 
From Federally Funded Scientific Research

Since publishing papers and generating data are the major tangible 
products of the grants given by SMD we want to encourage our 
communities to know about these RFIs.  

To make it easier to share with others I have created these tiny 
URLs

PROPOSAL WRITING WORKSHOP 

Most planetary scientists depend on competitive NASA research grants 
from the Planetary Science Division (PSD) to fund their work, and each 
year NASA receives thousands of proposals and selects only ~1/3 of 
them. How will you fare in this competition? Do you know how to write
a NASA proposal? Do you know where to submit it? Do you know the 
lessons your competitors have gleaned after years of writing their 
own proposals?

If you are unsure of the answers to any of these questions please 
plan on attending an upcoming Proposal Writing Workshop. The workshop 
is sponsored by the Department of Terrestrial Magnetism of the 
Carnegie Institution for Science and will be given by Curt Niebur,
a program scientist in the PSD at NASA Headquarters. The workshop 
is open to all and will focus on understanding NASA's research 
programs, including information on how to write a research proposal, 
where to apply for funding, and pathways for participation on missions.

Workshop details:

Tuesday, December 13, 1:00 to 5:00 pm

Carnegie's Department of Terrestrial Magnetism
5241 Broad Branch Rd. NW
Washington DC 20015 

Please RSVP to Jan Dunlap (dunlap@dtm.ciw.edu) to reserve a place 
and get other logistics details.
