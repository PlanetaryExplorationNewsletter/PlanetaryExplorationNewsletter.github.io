CONWAY LEOVY (JULY 16, 1933 - July 9, 2011)

Conway Leovy was a professor in Atmospheric Sciences and Geophysics at  
the University of Washington, Seattle, whose contributions to  
planetary science spanned over forty years. He made major contributions 
to our understanding of planetary atmospheres, including those of 
Earth, Mars, Venus, Jupiter and Titan. His work was recognized by a 
NASA Exceptional Scientific Achievement Medal in 1973 and the Kuiper 
Prize of the American Astronomical Society's Division of Planetary 
Science in 2000.

In Mars exploration, Conway participated in imaging experiments on the  
Mariner 6 and 7 flyby missions in the 1960s, while in the 1970s, he was 
part of the teams for the imaging experiment of Mariner 9 and the  
Meteorology Experiment on the Viking Landers. Conway was also a Co- 
Investigator for the Mars Climate Sounder instrument on Mars  
Reconnaissance Orbiter.

Conway remained engaged with friends, colleagues and family up until a  
couple of weeks before he died of cancer on July 9, 2011. His sharp 
mind, modesty, and generosity will be much missed by everyone.

AGU FALL 2011 SESSION:  P07. EXPERIMENTAL RESEARCH SUPPORTING THE 
EXPLORATION OF SMALL BODIES

Dear Colleagues,

You are welcome to participate in and submit an abstract to the session 
P07 "Experimental Research Supporting the Exploration of Small Bodies"

Description: Our understanding of small bodies has significantly 
progressed over the past decades thanks to increased capabilities of 
ground-based facilities as well as dedicated space missions. 
Interpreting these observations relies on laboratory measurements, 
whether they are obtained from spectroscopic techniques, RADAR, or 
geological imaging. This session will survey the current state of 
knowledge of experimental research in the perspective of recent 
observations and future exploration of small bodies. Emphasis will be 
laid on laboratory measurements obtained on very porous, very cold, 
very exotic material, and address, for example, the impact of space 
weathering, the properties of methane and nitrogen ices, volatile 
trapping, etc.

Deadline for abstract submission: 04 August 2011

AGU FALL 2011 SESSION: P14. INTEGRATED AND VALID IN SITU EXPLORATION OF
PLANETS (INCLUDING EARTH)

Please consider submitting an abstract.  

Conveners: Max Coleman, Frank Grunthaner, and Kris Zacny  

http://sites.agu.org/fallmeeting/scientific-program/session-search/648  

To maximize scientific return from planetary exploration it is 
important to integrate data from sample handling, in-situ science 
instruments and  from remote observations. Exploration on Earth, for 
example, increasingly combines data from field laboratories and in situ 
instruments on the surface and in boreholes. We want to encourage 
debate  and transfer of ideas between the planetary and terrestrial 
geoscience  communities. We welcome a broad range of papers that 
describe individual  devices and show how the data from these devices
complement or have  complemented data from other devices. Papers can 
relate to any planetary  body and to Earth and hence contributions on 
topics in these areas will  be welcomed from the planetary and 
terrestrial geoscience communities.   

The deadline to submit an abstract is to AGU is 02 September 2010 
- 23:59 Eastern Daylight Time (EDT) or 03:59+1 GMT.

AGU FALL 2011 SESSION: P18. MARS SYSTEM SCIENCE: INTEGRATING MARTIAN
PLANETARY PROCESSES FROM THE SUBSURFACE TO THE SURFACE

This session will focus on linking processes that delivered material 
from the martian interior to the surface and shallow subsurface 
environment, fluid/rock interactions at deep and shallow levels that 
could have modified this material, and processes that may have 
redistributed material across the martian surface. Integrating our 
understanding of these processes is fundamental to developing new 
insights into geochemical cycling on Mars and its evolution over time. 
We invite diverse contributions from martian geochemistry, petrology, 
and geophysics.

The deadline for abstracts is August 4.

AGU FALL 2011 SESSION: P38. GEOPHYSICAL & ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCE OF 
EXOPLANETS

Recent years have seen an exponential increase in the number of 
extrasolar planets discovered and the first observational constraints 
on the chemistry and dynamics of exoplanet atmospheres. Geophysical 
and atmospheric scientists have a great deal to contribute to the 
characterization and study of exoplanets. Additionally, data from 
exoplanets may allow us to test and generalize our theories for Earth 
and other Solar System planets. We are hoping for a broad and lively 
session and encourage the submission of studies on any of the following 
topics: interiors of exoplanets, exoplanet atmospheres, general 
considerations relating to planetary habitability, and issues related 
to early Earth that might apply to exoplanets.  To submit an abstract,

[NASA] GRAIL GUEST SCIENTIST PROGRAM (GSP)

The goals of the program are to: a) enhance the scientific return from 
the GRAIL mission by broadening participation in the mission, and b) 
augment the existing GRAIL science team to include new members 
conducting investigations that broaden and/or complement the funded 
Principal Investigator (PI)-led investigations, thus maximizing the 
contribution of GRAIL to the future exploration and scientific 
understanding of the Moon. Because the intention is to enhance and 
broaden the scientific return, investigations submitted by the 
GRAIL PI and Co-Investigators (Co-I) will not be considered.

Selected Guest Scientists (GSs) will become members of the GRAIL science 
team and be required to fulfill some of the same responsibilities as 
those of current science team members. The selected GSs will coordinate 
their activities and analyses with the GRAIL Mission Project Scientist, 
Co-Investigators (Co-Is), and NASA Program Scientist, and they will be 
bound by team agreements. 

Notice of Intent due date: August 18, 2011.
Proposal due date: October 12, 2011.

VEXAG MEETING

The next 1.5 day VEXAG meeting will be held Aug. 30-31 at the Hazy 
Center, Smisthsonian Air & Space Museum near Dulles airport.  A key 
goal of this meeting is to update the top science questions, goals, 
objectives, and investigations in response to the 2011 Decadal Survey 
Report.  Another goal is to define a new exploration theme that can 
support the selection of Venus missions in the coming decade. The 
current goals/objectives/investigations document and proposed science 
questions are available on the VEXAG website.  All parties interested 
in the future of Venus exploration are strongly encouraged to attend 
this meeting.  Additionally, a new student focus group is being formed 
and student travel support is available.  A Venus science meeting will 
be held August 31-Sept. 1. 

Abstracts are due August 10, 2011.

Meeting details are available on the VEXAG website:

HIGH RESOLUTION TOPOGRAPHIC DATA FOR YOUR RESEARCH

This announcement describes opportunities for obtaining digital 
topographic data in support of geologic mapping and other research that
are of particular importance because the NASA PG&G Cartography program 
does not currently support the systematic production of topographic map
quadrangles.

The Astrogeology Team of the USGS, Flagstaff operates a Planetary 
Photogrammetry Guest Facility on behalf of the PG&G program.  Qualified 
scientists are welcome to use this facility to produce digital topographic 
models (DTMs) from stereo images.  Training and use of the system are free 
but researchers are responsible for their travel expenses  because the 
state-of-the-art hardware/software system cannot be used remotely.  For 
more information about capabilities and how to apply, see 

http://astrogeology.usgs.gov/Technology/Photogrammetry/

Cartographers of the Astrogeology Team are also available to partner with 
researchers to deliver DTMs via subcontract to a research proposal.  The 
cost of DTMs depends on the volume and complexity of the image data 
analyzed and the ancillary products included, but is in the range of 
$5-10K for HiRISE and LROC-NAC DTMs with meter-scale resolution and ~10^8 
height points.  For further information see the web page above or send 
inquiries to Dr. Randolph Kirk at the USGS (rkirk@usgs.gov).
