PLANETARY SCIENCE SLIDES AND ILLUSTRATIONS

Are you looking for some great slides or illustrations to use in your 
classes this term? The Planetary Science Research Discoveries website
has sets of Powerpoint slides. These are summaries of PSRD articles 
covering the origin of solar systems and the processes by which 
planets, moons, and small bodies form and evolve. The slides are 
annotated with captions and notes, and are linked to PSRD articles 
that provide the full context, additional graphics, and references.

Web link: 

http://www.psrd.hawaii.edu/Archive/Archive-PSRDpresents.html

The Cosmochemistry Illustrated website offers Powerpoint slides with
planetary examples to enrich any geochemistry, petrology, and 
introductory geology course. References and background are given in
the notes pages.

VEXAG MEETING #9 AND VENUS SCIENCE CONFERENCE

Hazy Center, Smithsonian Air & Space Museum Near Dulles Airport
Tuesday, August 30, through Thursday, September 1, 2011

The next 1.5-day VEXAG meeting will be held Aug. 30-31 at the Hazy 
Center, Smithsonian Air & Space Museum, near Dulles airport. 

A key goal of this meeting is to update the top science questions, 
goals, objectives, and investigations in response to the 2011 Decadal
Survey Report.  Another goal is to define a new exploration theme 
that can support the selection of Venus missions in the coming decade.
The current goals/objectives/investigations document and proposed 
science questions are available on the VEXAG website.  All parties 
interested in the future of Venus exploration are strongly encouraged
to attend this meeting.  Additionally, a new student focus group is 
being formed and student travel support is available.  A Venus 
science meeting will be held August 31-September 1.

Abstracts are due August 10, 2011.

Meeting details are available on the VEXAG website:

POSTDOCTORAL RESEARCHER: PETROLOGY OF PLANETARY MATERIALS

The Lunar and Planetary Institute (LPI), part of the Universities 
Space Research Association, invites applications for a postdoctoral 
fellowship in the petrology of planetary materials.

The successful candidate will work with Dr. Allan Treiman in NASA-
funded efforts, focusing on planetary crusts and magmas, and their 
volatiles constituents; target materials include lunar highlands 
rocks, Martian meteorites, and terrestrial analogs.  These efforts 
focus on planetary samples, starting with analyses by optical 
microscopy and electron microprobe; other instruments are available 
at nearby Johnson Space Center or with external collaborators.  The
candidate will be encouraged to design and conduct their own research
in planetary science, propose for external funding, participate in 
grant review panels and analysis groups, and become involved with 
spacecraft missions.

The successful candidate will have a recent Ph.D. in petrology or 
geochemistry; experience with planetary materials is helpful, but 
not required.  The position would be for two years, with possible 
extension to a third year.  Review of candidates will begin on 
November 15, 2011, with a hiring decision as soon as possible 
thereafter. Further information can be found on our website:

www.lpi.usra.edu

Employer.

POSTDOCTORAL RESEARCHERS IN LUNAR SCIENCE

The Universities Space Research Association's Lunar and Planetary 
Institute (LPI) invites applications for lunar science and exploration
postdoctoral fellowships.  Opportunities include:

Lunar Surface Geology and Remote Sensing - Using new LRO data; 
integrating it with existing lunar data to evaluate processes 
associated with impact cratering and/or planetary differentiation. 
Experience with orbital remote sensing methods, photometry of lunar 
materials, and photogeology of lunar or lunar-like terrains preferred. 

Experimental and/or Analytical Petrology and Geochemistry - Using 
Apollo and lunar meteorite samples (or synthetic analogues) to 
evaluate processes associated with impact cratering and/or planetary 
differentiation.  Experience with electron and ion microprobes, 
and/or LA-ICPMS techniques preferred.

Modeling of Impact Cratering Processes - Using hydrocodes and relevant
analytical techniques to evaluate different cratering processes on the
Moon, to model specific crater or basin-forming events, and potentially
guide future exploration scenarios. 

The successful candidate will be a member of the new LPI-JSC Center 
for Lunar Science and Exploration

http://www.lpi.usra.edu/nlsi/

one of the core teams within the NASA Lunar Science Institute.

NASA POSTDOCTORAL FELLOWSHIPS

The NASA Postdoctoral Program welcomes applications for the November 
cycle.  These competitive one- to three-year appointments advance 
NASA's missions in space science, earth science, aeronautics, space 
operations, exploration systems, lunar science, and astrobiology.

Applicants must have a Ph.D. or equivalent degree in hand before 
beginning the fellowship, but may apply while completing the degree
requirements. U. S. citizens and foreign nationals who hold Lawful 
Permanent Resident status or who are eligible for J-1 status as a 
Research Scholar may apply.  An H-1B Visa status is not acceptable
because the NPP is not an employment program.

Stipend rates for Postdoctoral Fellows start at $50,000 per year, 
with moderate supplements for high cost-of-living areas and for 
certain academic specialties. Funds are available for relocation 
expenses, up to a specified limit, and health insurance is available
through the program. Fellows also receive $8,000 per appointment year
to support travel to conferences, meetings, and other activities that
directly support their research.

Applications for the NASA Postdoctoral Program are accepted three 
times each year: March 1, July 1, and November 1.

The DPS is providing childcare grants of up to $250 per family for 
members that are presenting at the meeting. Parents are responsible 
for making arrangements for childcare. Acceptable uses for childcare 
funds include: funding extra childcare at home, paying for care at 
the meeting, and paying travel expenses for dependents or caregivers.

CANDIDATE NOMINATIONS FOR REVIEW BOARD

The Space Studies Board (SSB) of the National Research Council 
anticipates a new study concerning NASA's astronomy science centers. 
The study is intended to examine the processes used by each center 
for reviewing and awarding observation time, access to mission data,
and funding.  The study goals are to: 
(1) ensure that the science centers' practices, processes, and 
community relations maximize the science for the available resources.
(2) identify any contractual or management processes that hinder the 
centers from maximizing the science return.  

The Centers to be reviewed include:
* STScI,
* NASA Exoplanet Science Institute,
* Chandra X-ray Center,
* Spitzer Science Center, and
* SOFIA Science Center

Service on the study committee is open to scientists, engineers, and
other experts, including those working for a government agency if: 
(1) they have relevant scientific and technical expertise, and 
(2) their service will not appear to compromise the independence and 
objectivity of the study.

It is anticipated that no more than half of the committee's members 
will be astronomers.

Please include in your recommendations: name, primary areas of 
expertise, contact information (including institutional/company 
affiliation).
