AGU SPECIAL SESSION P004 - CHARACTERIZING SMALL SOLAR SYSTEM BODIES 

The composition and physical properties of Small Solar System Bodies 
(SSSBs), remnants of the formation of planets, are key to better 
understand our solar system. Increased knowledge of their surface 
properties and their potential as resources are also necessary to 
prepare for robotic and human exploration. Hints about the internal 
structure and composition of SSSBs have been acquired recently thanks 
to flyby/rendezvous data from space missions, study of multiple 
asteroid systems, or close encounter between asteroids. This session 
welcomes abstracts on the internal structure and composition of SSSBs 
based on space and ground-based data, numerical models, and 
instrument/mission concepts in the prospect of future exploration.

Conveners: 
Franck Marchis (SETI Institute)

AGU SESSION P005 - DESTINATION: EUROPA

With the recent flurry of activity surrounding the Europa Clipper 
mission and ongoing interest in Europa exploration, we invite you to 
participate in an exciting session at AGU. The Destination: Europa 
session seeks to raise the level of discussion about Europa, encourage 
new hypotheses and to integrate geology, geophysics and astrobiology to 
motivate new Europa science and get the community excited about future 
exploration of this exciting moon.

Europa is one of the most compelling bodies in the search for life. 
Given growing support for a new Europa mission such as Europa Clipper, 
this session will present perspectives from a wide range of geological, 
geophysical and ultimately astrobiological backgrounds that are 
forward-looking to what questions the next Europa mission could answer. 
We invite presentations that present cross-cutting themes related to 
the physical nature of Europa and its habitability. We encourage 
presenters to utilize new or existing data, compelling terrestrial 
analogs, and theoretical models to advance new hypotheses or revisit 
and refresh the state-of-the-art in Europa science, and address how 
these ideas relate to future Europa exploration.

Abstracts are due August 6.

There has been a continual spacecraft presence at Mars since 1997, 
showing how Mars is changing on decadal timescales. This activity 
includes planet-encircling dust storms about every 3-4 Mars years 
and associated surface changes, along with evolution of the polar 
caps. High-resolution imaging has revealed new impact sites, 
migrating sand, and a suite of processes on slopes, some of which may 
involve liquid water. The distribution of shallow ice is much better 
known, with implications for recent climate change. Manuscripts 
resulting from these unique, long-term observations will be due at 
the end of 2013 for a special section of Icarus, so this conference 
is an ideal time to present the results.

AGU SESSION P010 - FIRST RESULTS OF C/2012 S1 (ISON): COMET OF THE 
CENTURY?

Comet C/2102 S1, popularly known as C/ISON, is a sun-grazing comet, 
originating in the Oort cloud. It is predicted to be the brightest 
comet of the century and has captured the interest of global 
professional and amateur astronomers alike. On its initial passage 
through the inner solar system, C/ISON potentially can become a very 
bright daytime object as it approaches perihelion in November 2013. 
Whether the comet lives up to the predictions or not, first results 
from various world-wide coordinated observing campaigns, including an 
armada of spacecraft, orbiting telescopes and ground-based 
professional and amateur facilities will be showcased.

AGU SESSION P019 - PLANETARY ATMOSPHERES AND EVOLUTION

Understanding the evolutionary histories of planetary atmospheres is
one of the key scientific questions driving planetary mission planning. 
While the evolution of our own planet, the Earth, is constrained by 
geological and geochemical data, the evolutionary paths of other 
planetary bodies must be determined from planetary mission data and 
astronomical observations. The discoveries of extrasolar planets 
greatly expand the interests of the scientific community and provide 
a new opportunity for interdisciplinary collaborations between 
geoscientists, astronomers, and planetary scientists. The session 
welcomes both observational and theoretical studies relevant to the 
evolution of planetary objects in and outside of our solar system 
(including the Earth).

AGU SESSION P021 - POLARIMETRY AS AN INVALUABLE TOOL TO STUDY 
THE SOLAR SYSTEM AND BEYOND

Polarimetry is a powerful tool providing a wealth of information about 
Earth and planetary atmospheres; solar system objects, exoplanets and 
search for habitability beyond Earth that cannot be obtained by 
traditional photometric and spectroscopic observations. This session 
is open to papers about advances in vector radiative transfer theory 
(including non-sphericity effects on single scattering); laboratory
measurements and instrumentation for the characterization of solar, 
terrestrial, planetary and exoplanetary atmospheres; atmosphereless 
bodies; dust; astrobiological markers; and instrumental developments 
for imaging and spectropolarimeters to be included in ground-based 
facilities and/or onboard space missions.

AGU SESSION ED018 - ERA OF CITIZEN SCIENCE: INTERSECTION OF OUTREACH,
SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH AND BIG DATA

The traditional method of outreach to a variety of formal, informal, 
science and non-science audiences has undergone a fundamental change 
with recent advances in technology, social media and big data, giving 
way to citizen science with many applications. However, there is also 
a rising demographics of citizen science users that provide data sets 
for professionals or inverse citizen science application. The blurring 
of the data scientist and data user is a shift from the current 
paradigm of citizen science. This session invites papers on 
methodology, applications of citizen science to outreach, research, 
transformative approaches to science education and the future of 
citizen science.

HALF-DAY WORKSHOP: DEFINING HEAT SHIELD CAPABILITY NEEDS FOR EXTREME
ENTRY ENVIRONMENT MISSIONS

NASA Ames Research Center will host a half-day workshop to facilitate 
engagement between the mission design community and technology 
developers on new woven ablative thermal protection materials under 
development. The intent of this workshop is to ensure successful 
technology maturation that leads to direct mission insertion to enable 
science missions that are not feasible today. The workshop will 
provide mission designers with insight into woven TPS technology, 
design studies performed to-date, capability requirements identified 
and technology development risks and risk mitigation strategies. The 
goal is to engage the end user community to improve the focus of 
current development in order to enable and feed the technology into 
upcoming Discovery and New Frontier proposals.

The event will be held 8:30-11:30 am PDT on Tuesday, July 30, 2013 
at NASA Ames Research Center, Moffett Field, California and via WebEx. 
This workshop will be ITAR restricted and participants are required to 
be U.S. Citizens or permanent residents. All attendees must register 
in advance and attendance may be restricted.

The objective of the Planetary Mission Data Analysis Program (PMDAP) 
is to increase significantly the scientific return of Planetary Science 
Division missions by broadening the scientific participation in the 
enhancement of archived data collected by those missions. In addition, 
this program supports the restoration and archiving of unarchived or 
incomplete mission datasets, the digitization of nondigital data, and 
the production of higher-order mission data products. The PMDAP also 
supports the use of archived planetary data from other NASA and 
non-NASA missions.

The final text for the PMDAP AO replaces the draft text in its entirety. 
Many changes have been made so prospective proposers should read the 
text carefully. Notices of Intent are requested by August 16, 2013, and
