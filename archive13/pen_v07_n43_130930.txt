[NASA] SARA'S SPECIAL MESSAGE ABOUT SHUTDOWN AND THE SMD RESEARCH
PROGRAM

If the government shuts down only research that requires access to 
government labs or participation of NASA personnel will have to halt. 
Most grants at universities and other non-NASA facilities will 
continue. I have been told that the Department of Health and Human 
Services' Payment Management System will continue to operate, though 
with reduced staff presence, so that those grantees who can continue 
work will be able to continue drawing funds during shutdown.

If a Government shutdown occurs and continues, proposal due dates 
will be delayed to permit Government institutions and other affected 
offerors time to submit proposals after they return to work. We have 
already posted notices of our intentions on the NSPIRES pages of 
MDAP (due 10/4), H-GCR (due 10/11), and PMDAP (due 10/11), but official 
amendments delaying due dates will not go out until closer to those due 
dates and if the government remains shut down.

The Mars 2020 AO may be affected in a number of ways, if the Government 
is shut down for some duration. The preproposal conference, scheduled 
for 10/8, may be rescheduled and the due date for NOIs (currently 
10/15) could be delayed, if the government is still shut down closer to 
those dates.

If the Government shuts down, ROSES proposal peer review panels will be 
rescheduled.

Since NASA civil servants have been strictly and sternly warned against 
even volunteering any time, the program officers will not be able to 
respond to email or voicemail messages if the government is shutdown.

Finally, I have been told that all of our websites will not just become 
stale but will not be available. I recommend that proposers visit:

for the latest on due dates associated with our solicitations.
