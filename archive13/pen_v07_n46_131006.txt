Location:  Plaza F

A high-level summary of the mid-September conference "Uranus beyond 
Voyager 2" (held in Meudon) will be presented, after which we will

discussion. We will not have formal science presentations, though 
projection capabilities will be available to support the conversation 
as needed.
