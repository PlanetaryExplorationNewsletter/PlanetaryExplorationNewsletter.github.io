EGU SESSION PS5.1/ST4.4: PLANETARY PLASMA PHYSICS AND INTERACTIONS IN
THE SOLAR SYSTEM

The emphasis of the session is on all aspects of planetary plasma
physics and interactions in the Solar System, including:

(a) Magnetospheres, ionospheres, auroras
(b) The solar wind interaction with planets, moons, asteroids and 
    comets
(c) Plasma interactions with exospheres, dust and surfaces (e.g., at
    Mercury, Europa, Ganymede, our Moon, etc.)
(d) Intercomparisons of planetary environments

Contributions are welcome which address previous (e.g., CHANDRAYAAN-1,
KAGUYA), present (e.g., CASSINI, MARS EXPRESS, VENUS EXPRESS, ROSETTA,
MESSENGER, CHANG'E 2), forthcoming (e.g., BEPI COLOMBO) and planned 
(e.g., JUICE) observations from space. Analyses of ground-based 
observations of neutral and ionized environments are welcome. 
Theoretical modelling and simulations are also strongly encouraged, 
both in themselves and as a basis for intercomparisons and 
interpretation of measurements. Laboratory studies on planetary 
analogues aiming to simulate the surface-plasma interaction are 
considered as well.

The participants will be later invited to submit an article in a 
forthcoming dedicated special issue in Planetary and Space Science.

Please, consider that the abstract submission *deadline is 
16 January 2014*

[NASA] CALL FOR JOINT NASA ROSCOSMOS/IKI VENERA-D SCIENCE DEFINITION 
TEAM

Response Date: January 3, 2014

Scientists, technologists, and other qualified and interested 
individuals are invited to apply for membership on the Science 
Definition Team (SDT) for the Venera-D Venus mission, a strategic 
Venus mission sponsored by Roscosmos, with participation by NASA SMD 
Planetary Science Division. For more information see the full text of 
the call at:

[NASA] EPOESS WILL NOT BE SOLICITED IN ROSES-13

The Opportunities in Education and Public Outreach for Earth and Space 
Science (EPOESS) will not be solicited in ROSES-13.
 
The EPOESS solicitation is for project activities utilizing SMD content 
supporting NASA education and public outreach (E/PO) objectives. It 
solicits proposals that address substantial and substantive educational 
or outreach needs or problems and offer solutions of significant 
impact. Project activities are expected to be relevant to NASA SMD 
Education and Outreach portfolio.
 
NASA has decided not to solicit proposals for EPOESS in ROSES 2013, 
because of uncertainty in the FY 2014 budget. However, SMD 
anticipates that this program will be solicited in ROSES 2014, at which 
time the FY 2014 budget should be better known.

CAS-NAS FORUM FOR NEW LEADERS IN SPACE SCIENCE

The National Space Science Center of the Chinese Academy of Sciences 
and the Space Studies Board of U.S. National Academy of Sciences' 
National Research Council invites applications for the 2014 inaugural 
CAS-NAS Forum for New Leaders in Space Science. The Forum is designed 
to provide opportunities for a highly select group of young space 
scientists from China and the United States to discuss their research 
activities in an intimate and collegial environment. The 2014 Fora will 
be held in Beijing on May 8-9, 2014 and in Irvine, California, on 
November 3-4, 2014. The scientific scope of both events is limited to 
the general areas of space astronomy and solar and space physics. 
Additional details, including eligibility requirements and application 
procedures, can be found at: 

http://sites.nationalacademies.org/SSB/SSB_086017 

The application deadline is 13 January, 2014.

Center on a research project of current interest in lunar and planetary 
science. Furthermore, you will participate in peer-reviewed research, 
learn from top-notch planetary scientists, and preview various careers 
in science.
 
The 10-week program runs from June 2 through August 8, 2014. Interns 
will receive a $5000.00 stipend plus $1000.00 U.S. travel stipend, or

NASA POSTDOCTORAL FELLOWSHIPS
 
The NASA Postdoctoral Program (NPP) provides opportunities for 
scientists and engineers to conduct research largely of their own 
choosing, yet compatible with the research opportunities posted on the 
NPP Web site.
 
Selected by a competitive peer-review process, NPP Fellows complete 
one- to three-year Fellowship appointments that advance NASA's 
missions in earth science, heliophysics, planetary science, 
astrophysics, space bioscience, aeronautics and engineering, human 
exploration and space operations, and astrobiology.
 
An example of one of the research opportunities in planetary science 
is:
 
https://www3.orau.gov/NPDoc/Catalog/18696         
 
Applicants must have a Ph.D. or equivalent degree in hand before 
beginning the fellowship, but may apply while completing the degree 
requirements. U. S. citizens, Lawful Permanent Residents, and 
foreign nationals eligible for J-1 status as a Research Scholar may 
apply.
 
Stipends start at $53,500 per year, with supplements for high 
cost-of-living areas and for certain academic specialties. Financial 
assistance is available for relocation and health insurance, and 
$8,000 per year is provided for professional travel.

Applications are accepted three times each year: March 1, July 1, and 
November 1.

ENDURING QUESTS, DARING VISIONS - NASA ASTROPHYSICS IN THE NEXT THREE
DECADES

In early 2013, the Astrophysics Subcommittee (APS) of the NASA 
Advisory Council/Science Committee commissioned a Task Force to develop 
a vision for NASA's Astrophysics Division spanning the next three 
decades. The charter given to this team was to produce a compelling 
long-term vision for space astrophysics building upon the baseline 
given in the recent Decadal Survey "New Worlds New Horizons." 
 
The Roadmap Task Force report is now completed and will be posted on 
December 20, 2013 on:
