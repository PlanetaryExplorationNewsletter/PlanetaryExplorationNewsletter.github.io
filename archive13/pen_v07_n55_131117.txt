[NASA] IMPORTANT CHANGES IN THE NASA PLANETARY SCIENCE DIVISION’S (PSD) 
RADIOISOTOPE PROGRAM

James Green, Director, Planetary Science Division NASA

For the last several years PSD has been investing in Advanced Stirling 
Radioisotope Generator (ASRG) technology with the intent to fabricate 
flight units for deep space missions. The advanced Stirling technology 
was selected to take advantage of its increased efficiency over the 
Multi-Mission Radioisotope Thermal Generator (MMRTG), since the supply 
of Plutonium-238 (Pu-238) was limited at the time. Now, with the 
restart of the Pu-238 production project this year, we expect to have 
a sufficient supply of Pu-238 for radioisotope power well into the 
future.
 
With an adequate supply of Pu-238, and considering the current budget-
constrained environment, NASA has decided to discontinue procurement 
of ASRG flight hardware. We have given direction to the Department of 
Energy, which manages the flight procurement, to end work on the 
flight units. The hardware procured under this activity will be 
transferred to the Glenn Research Center to continue development and 
testing of the Stirling technology.
 
For future planetary missions that require radioisotope power systems 
the flight-proven MMRTG will be made available. It is important to 
note that the MMRTG and the ASRG were designed to provide 
approximately the same electrical power output.    
 
I am happy to discuss this decision at all the upcoming Assessment 
Group meetings and at the American Geophysical Union meeting next 
month where I will address any questions that you may have.

[NASA] ASTROPHYSICS EXPLORER AO ANNOUNCEMENT

Community Announcement on Astrophysics Explorer AO – NNH14ZDA002J
 
The NASA Science Mission Directorate (SMD) is releasing this Community 
Announcement concerning its intention to solicit investigations for 
the Astrophysics Explorer Program. The Astrophysics Explorer Program 
conducts Principal Investigator (PI)-led space science investigations 
to advance NASA's strategic goals in astrophysics, which are to 
discover the origin, structure, evolution, and destiny of the Universe 
and search for Earth-like planets. Additional information concerning 
these areas of investigation is provided through appropriate links 
found on the SMD homepage at: 

http://science.nasa.gov/
  
Further information as it becomes available will be posted on the 
Explorer Program Acquisition website at: 

http://explorers.larc.nasa.gov/APSMEX 

Questions or comments about this intention to release an Astrophysics 
SMEX AO may be addressed in writing or by E-mail to the Astrophysics 
Explorer Program Scientist (NOTE: subject line to read "Astrophysics 
SMEX AO"): 

Dr. Wilton T. Sanders
SMD, NASA
wilton.t.sanders@nasa.gov

Responses to all inquiries will be answered by E-mail and also posted 
weekly at the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) location of the Explorer 
Program Acquisition website; anonymity of persons/institutions who 
submit questions will be preserved.

The Caltech Postdoctoral Scholars Program at the Jet Propulsion 
Laboratory (JPL) invites applications for a postdoctoral research 
position in JPL's Planetary Science Section.

The research will involve selection of landing sites for the 2016 
InSight Discovery and 2020 Mars Rover Missions. Dr. Matt Golombek will 
serve as JPL postdoctoral advisor to the selected candidate who will 
carry out research in collaboration with the advisor, resulting in 
publications. 

Candidates should have a recent PhD in Planetary Geology or related 
field with a strong background using and analyzing Mars remote sensing 
data. Experience in ArcGIS is highly desirable as well as experience 
working with and/or generating digital elevation models. Candidates 
who received their PhD within the past five years prior to the date of 
their application are eligible. The annual starting salary for recent
PhD is US$52,000 and can vary somewhat according to the applicant's 
qualifications. Postdoctoral Scholar positions are awarded for a 
minimum of one-year period and may be renewed to a maximum of three 
years.

Please send a letter describing your research interests, a curriculum

led by the Centre for Planetary Science and Exploration at The 
University of Western Ontario, Canada. Collaborating institutions are 
the University of British Columbia, Memorial University of 
Newfoundland, Queen’s University, University of Toronto, and York 
University. Positions may be tenable at any of these 6 universities.

This program provides interdisciplinary training and opportunities
in 4 key areas of research:

1) Earth and Planetary Materials Research
2) Mechatronic Tools
3) Imaging and Analysis Instrumentation
4) Exploration Surface Systems

Fellows will benefit from participation in cutting-edge short courses,
research, and internships with industry and government.

A full description of this program and details in the application 
process can be found at: 

http://create.uwo.ca

MESSAGE REGARDING ESA'S EXOMARS LANDING SITE SELECTION WORKING GROUP

To Members of the Mars Exploration Community:
 
On Nov. 4, an announcement was circulated to the MEPAG mailing list 
regarding the call for letters of application for membership in ESA’s 
ExoMars Landing Site Selection Working Group (LSSWG). NASA has received 
a number of questions from members of the U.S. community regarding 
whether they could expect support if they were to apply and be 
selected. Dr. Michael Meyer, NASA’s Mars Lead Scientist, has indicated 
that NASA intends to support the ExoMars landing site process, 
including by means of travel support for a few selected U.S. members of 
the steering committee.
 
As a reminder, the deadline for these application letters is Monday, 
25 November 2013 (12:00 CET).

I would like to call everyone's attention to a new T/TS position in
"Geoscience Sustainability" in the Department of Geology and Planetary
Science at the University of Pittsburgh. More information can be found 
at the Department's website:

http://www.geology.pitt.edu/about/news/Sustainability_Position.html

We are interested in a wide range of skills, but of particular interest
would be researchers involved large-scale global geospatial analysis of 
data focused on natural disasters (particularly volcano and volcano-
climate studies), climate change and/or glacial processes, all of which 
could also include planetary analog studies/research.

Review of applicants will begin on January 1, 2014 and proceed until 
theposition is filled.  A Ph.D. is required at the time of appointment, 
and the position begins in the fall term of 2014, subject to budgetary 
approval.

NEW ABSTRACT DEADLINE - WORKSHOP ON THE HABITABILITY OF ICY WORLDS
 
Abstract Deadline extended to 26 November 2013
 
February 5–7, 2014, Pasadena, Calif.
 
http://www.hou.usra.edu/meetings/icyworlds2014
 
The primary objective of this workshop will be to focus on the 
astrobiological potential of icy worlds in the outer solar system–
including Europa, Ganymede, Enceladus, Titan and beyond–with 
discussion on future research directions and spacecraft missions that 
can best assess that potential. The agenda for the workshop will be 
organized around thematic sessions that address the potential 
habitability of the unique planetary environments of the outer solar 
system. Presentations on research involving terrestrial analogs for icy 
world environments are also encouraged. The workshop will be divided 
into thematic sessions on: water and exotic solvents; chemical energy 
for life; organics and their detection; ocean physics and chemistry; 
icy world activity and habitability over time; continuing and future 
outer solar system exploration.
