STEPHEN EUGENE DWORNIK (1926-2012)
 
Stephen E. Dwornik passed away peacefully on December 17, 2012. Dwornik 
was born July 3, 1926, in Buffalo, New York.
 
He attended Buffalo's Technical High School then enlisted in the Army. 
Dwornik participated in the Battle of the Bulge and received the Army's 
Bronze Star. He entered SUNY Buffalo where he received Bachelor's and 
Master's degrees in Geology. He did field work in Alaska along the 
Brooks Range in the late 1940s and later moved to Springfield, 
Virginia, to work with mine detection at the U.S. Army Engineer 
Research and Development Laboratories; he then worked in planetary 
geology space research at NASA.
 
While at NASA, Dwornik acted as a Project Manager for the lunar 
Surveyor Program. Dwornik co-authored several books, including Atlas 
of Mercury. One of his fondest memories was providing the first 
substantial NASA funding to the young astronomer Carl Sagan. After 
retirement from NASA, Dwornik enjoyed a second career with Ball 
Aerospace, and volunteered to help create a planetary Braille map and 
speak for ElderHostel courses. He endowed the Stephen E. Dwornik 
Paper Award for Planetary Geology to support future generations of 
scientists.

SOLAR WIND INTERACTION WITH PLANETARY ENVIRONMENTS SESSION (PS-01) AT 
AOGS, BRISBANE, AUSTRALIA

We invite all members of the planetary space physics and aeronomy 
community to submit an abstract (deadline January 29) to the "Solar 
wind interaction with planetary environments" (PS-01) session at the 
Asia-Oceania Geosciences Society conference in Brisbane, Australia 
June 24-28, 2013. The aim of the proposed session is to gather works 
based on both in-situ and global measurements and/or numerical 
simulations in diverse astrophysical contexts to progress toward a 
global picture of the dynamics of planetary plasma environments. This 
session has a long history at AOGS and is generally very well attended. 
Invited speakers for this year are listed below:

M. Nishino: Kaguya's view of solar wind interaction with the moon
T. Zurbuchen: Mercury's plasma environment
D. Schriver: modeling plasma transport at Mercury
M. Fraenz: solar wind interaction with Mars and Venus
C. Paranicas: Jupiter magnetosphere and the JUNO mission
E. Kronberg: reconnection at Earth and Jupiter
K. Khurana: Saturn's magnetospheric dynamics
H. Lammer: stellar wind influence on evolution of planetary 
atmospheres
S. Hess: the magnetosphere of exoplanets

Abstract deadline: Tuesday, January 29

POSTDOCTORAL RESEARCHER IN PLANETARY SCIENCE

The Astrophysics group at the University of Bristol seeks applicants 
for an interdisciplinary project to study changes in the bulk 
composition of the Earth during accretion.  

The Research Assistant/Associate will be responsible for (1) conducting 
numerical simulations of the formation of planetary embryos in the 
terrestrial region using an N-body code and (2) analyzing these results 
to determine the compositional differences between embryos and the 
original planetesimals that could arise because of incomplete 
accretion. The main focus of this project is to determine if the 
collisional growth and evolution of the Earth could result in a non-
chondritic bulk composition.

The Research Assistant/Associate will be supervised by Dr. Zoe 
Leinhardt and also collaborate with Prof. Tim Elliott and Prof. Mike 
Walter at the University of Bristol and Prof. Sarah T. Stewart at 
Harvard University.

Applicants with interests in computational astrophysics/geophysics and 
planetary chemistry are strongly encouraged to apply. A Ph.D. in 
Astrophysics, Geophysics or related field is required.

The appointment is for 30 months. Apply online at: 

http://www.bris.ac.uk/jobs (ref:ACAD100184) 

by 3rd March. Interviews will begin 11th March and continue until the 
position is filled. For inquiries please email Dr. Leinhardt at
Zoe.Leinhardt@bristol.ac.uk

NASA POSTDOCTORAL FELLOWSHIPS

The NASA Postdoctoral Program (NPP) offers scientists and engineers 
unique opportunities to conduct research at NASA Centers. Each NPP 
fellowship opportunity is designed to advance NASA research in a 
specific project related to space science, earth science, aeronautics, 
exploration systems, lunar science, astrobiology, or astrophysics.

Applicants must have a Ph.D. or equivalent degree in hand before 
beginning the fellowship, but may apply while completing the degree 
requirements. U.S. citizens, Lawful Permanent Residents, and foreign 
nationals eligible for J-1 status as a Research Scholar may apply.

Stipends start at $53,500 per year, with supplements for high 
cost-of-living areas and for certain academic specialties. Financial 
assistance is available for relocation and health insurance, and 
$8,000 per year is provided for professional travel.

Applications are accepted three times each year: March 1, July 1, and 
November 1.

NEW PLANETARY SCIENCES EDITOR AT GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS

Geophysical Research Letters seeks to expand its role as a top journal 
in the Planetary Sciences. To that end, GRL has hired an additional 
editor to handle papers submitted in that field. GRL publishes short 
letters of broad interest that have an immediate impact on the research 
of others. GRL is the fastest publishing, high impact journal in earth 
and space sciences. Consider submitting your best work to GRL:

http://www.agu.org/journals/gl/

IF = 3.792, mean time from submission to publication = 12 weeks.

[NASA] EDUCATION PROJECT PROPOSALS SOLICITED

The NASA Office of Education, in cooperation with NASA Headquarters' 
Offices of Communications and Chief Technologist and Mission 
Directorates (i.e., Aeronautics Research, Human Exploration and 
Operations, and Science), seeks education project proposals through 
solicitation NNH13ZHA001N: Competitive Program for Science Museums, 
Planetariums and NASA Visitor Centers Plus Other Opportunities.  
Proposals must focus on NASA-inspired science, technology, engineering, 
or mathematics education or STEM, which may include but are not limited 
to, human space exploration, commercial crew and cargo, exhibits, and 
partnerships with K-12 educators, schools or districts. Successful 
proposals typically will be funded as grants or cooperative 
agreements.
 
Only non-profit entities that are legally recognized by a federal, 
state or local authority, including all types of NASA Visitor Centers 
(e.g., private, state or federal entities) located in the United States 
or its Territories are eligible to compete for funds. An eligible 
institution does not need to have the words museum, visitor center, 
science, or planetarium in its legal name.

SCIENCE VERIFICATION OF SAM: CALL FOR PROPOSALS

Deadline for proposals: March 15, 2013

The SOAR Adaptive Module (SAM) is a laser guide star adaptive optics
system that improves natural seeing at the 4.1-m SOAR telescope. The
instrument is equipped with a CCD imager (pixel scale 0.045 arcsec,
field of view 3 arcmin). SAM commissioning is almost complete, and we
are ready to begin Science Verification (SV) testing as a final step
prior to offering SAM on a shared risk basis in Semester 2013B.

Through this call for proposals (CfP), we solicit proposals for short
(<0.5 night) science projects which could be executed as part of this
SV testing process.  This solicitation is open to investigators from
all SOAR partners including the US, Brazilian and Chilean open access
communities.
