REMINDER: NASA PLANETARY SCIENCE DIVISION R&A PROGRAM RESTRUCTURING 
VIRTUAL TOWN HALL

Tuesday, December 3, 2013
12:00 noon to 4:00 pm (EST)

The Planetary Science Division announces a virtual town hall presenting 
the Research and Analysis Program Restructuring. The town hall will be 
held on Tuesday, December 3, 2013, 12:00 noon to 4:00 pm (EST). A 
presentation by Jonathan Rall will be followed by a question/answer 
period. The town hall will be live-streamed with participation 
available to anyone having Internet access. 

You can attend by connecting via Adobe Connect and listening through 
your computer (no phone line needed).

If you would like to ask a question type it into the chat room. A 
moderator will be collecting all the questions and asking them in the 
order they are received.

To log in to the Adobe Connect link, go to: 

https://connect.arc.nasa.gov/randa 

as a "Guest" using your full name. 

Slides presenting the historical background of the R&A restructuring, 
brief descriptions of the new portfolio elements and how they map to 
the old programs, the tentative due dates, and previous presentations 
and questions are available at:

AGU SPECIAL SESSION P018 - MERCURY AFTER TWO YEARS OF MESSENGER ORBITAL
OBSERVATIONS
 
We invite you to attend the special session on Mercury at the 2013 AGU 
Fall Meeting on December 9.

The session includes two sets of oral presentations, featuring papers 
on Mercury's geological and atmospheric/magnetospheric characteristics, 
from 08:00-10:00 (2022, Moscone West) and 10:20-12:20 (2005, Moscone 
West), respectively, and a poster session from 13:40-18:00 in Halls 
A-C.

After two full years of orbital observations of Mercury, NASA's 
MESSENGER spacecraft began its Second Extended Mission in March. The 
Second Extended Mission is addressing Mercury's surprising volatile 
inventory, exploring newly revealed aspects of the planet's geological 
evolution, and witnessing the dynamic response of Mercury's exosphere 
and magnetosphere to the peak and early waning phases of solar 
activity. This session will highlight the latest results on Mercury 
from MESSENGER orbital observations and welcomes contributed papers on 
future mission opportunities, complementary ground-based observations, 
laboratory measurements, and theoretical developments relevant to 
planetary processes at Mercury.

Invited authors:
Daniel Gershman (University of Michigan)
Suzanne Imber (University of Leicester)
Sebastiano Padovan (UCLA)

Conveners:
Paul Byrne (Carnegie Institution of Washington)
Sean Solomon (Columbia University)
Larry Nittler (Carnegie Institution of Washington)
