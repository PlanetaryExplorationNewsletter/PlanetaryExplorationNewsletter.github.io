[NASA] EXPECTED AMENDMENTS TO SMD CAN AND AO DUE DATE

Given the continuing Government shutdown, we expect to release 
amendments announcing the delay of proposal due dates next week 
(week of October 14, 2013). If the Government is still shutdown at 
the time these amendments are released, the due date will be set to 
"TBD". NSPIRES cannot support a "TBD" date, thus the date within the 
system will arbitrarily be set to 03/31/14 - to be consistent with 
ROSES "TBD" date changes. The solicitations will be amended again when 
the Government returns to work to provide the new due date.

Programs under consideration for amendment next week are as follows:

NNH13ZDA017C NASA Astrobiology Institute Cooperative Agreement 
(NAI CAN) Cycle 7: Step-1 proposals currently due November 4, 2013.

NNH12ZDA006O-EVI2 Earth Venture Instrument - 2 Announcement of 
Opportunity (AO): Proposals currently due November 7, 2013.

NNH13ZDA018O Mars 2020 Investigations Announcement of Opportunity 
(AO): Proposals currently due December 23, 2013.

Decisions on amending ROSES NOI and proposal due dates that are 
currently set to the end of October and early November will be made 
at a later date.

During the shutdown NASA personnel will not be available to answer 
questions, but the NSPIRES help line will be open. When the 
Government resumes business, questions should be directed to the 
Points of Contact for each solicitation. Those Points of Contact 
will be provided in the amendments expected to be released next week.

[NASA] DOCUMENTS AVAILABLE ON NSPIRES

Prior to the Government shutdown, a number of NASA documents that are 
relevant to proposers and reviewers were downloaded so that they 
could be cross-posted on NSPIRES in the event that the web sites 
that host them went down. We have just realized that we should have 
advertised the availability of these documents to people; apologies 
for the delay.

The following documents are available:

The Guidebook for Proposers is available on the NSPIRES home page at:

http://nspires.nasaprs.com/external/ 

via a link on "Site News".

The SMD 2010 Science Plan and the NASA 2011 Strategic Plan are both 
available as downloads from the Mars 2020 Announcement of Opportunity 
page as "Other Documents". See the Program Library Strategic documents. 
The direct link to the Mars page is:

http://solicitation.nasaprs.com/Mars2020

In addition, proposers interested in either the Earth Venture 
Instrument-2 (EVI-2) AO or the Mars 2020 AO are advised that the 
majority of the Program Library has been reproduced on NSPIRES, 
on those program's respective homepages.

VENUS TECHNOLOGY FORUM AT VEXAG MEETING #11 - TUESDAY, NOVEMBER 19TH

This Forum will present the status and a coherent picture of specific 
technologies useful to potential Venus Missions and discuss where 
they could be in 5-10 years. These technology evaluations and 
subsequent discussions will allow the community to be better educated 
when discussing the VEXAG's Venus Exploration Goals, Objectives and 
Investigations and Roadmap documents the following day at the VEXAG 
meeting. A draft of the Venus Exploration Technology Plan will be 
presented.

These questions will be addressed:
* What science opportunities for both near-term (< 10 years) missions 
  and longer-term (> 10 years) missions are enabled by existing 
  technologies? How are these opportunities limited by existing 
  technology?
* What science goals are driving technology development? What 
  technology synergies and crosscutting technologies have the 
  potential for changing the way Venus science is accomplished?
* How should we prioritize technology development?
* What gaps in the technology developments are due to the lack of 
  communication between scientists and technologists, hampering the 
  achievement of science goals?
* Are there gaps in funding for Venus-related instruments and 
  technology?

Instrument posters are encouraged for an evening session.

CALL FOR IMAGING OF CANDIDATE LANDING SITES FOR THE 2020 MARS ROVER 
MISSION

In response to the recent release of the Mars 2020 mission Announcement 
of Opportunity, we are soliciting imaging targets for candidate landing 
sites for the Mars 2020 rover mission. Candidate landing sites should 
be proposed based on their potential to satisfy the objectives of the 
2020 mission as detailed in the recent mission Science Definition Team 
(SDT) report (Mustard et al., 2013). This call relates to targets for 
new candidate landing sites as well as additional targets for candidate 
landing sites proposed to prior calls. Targets for sites satisfying 
the requirements will be provided to the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter 
(MRO) and Odyssey missions for imaging. 

Persons wishing to propose a candidate site should complete the 
abstract template found on the website below, which provides further 
details on the science objectives of the 2020 mission, engineering 
constraints on landing sites, possible enhancements to EDL, planetary 
protection constraints, and the information needed to identify a 
landing site and define the requested images.

Candidate landing sites should be submitted to both Matt Golombek 
(mgolombek@jpl.nasa.gov) and John Grant (grantj@si.edu) by 
November 15, 2013.

[NASA] PDS - GRAIL RELEASE 3

The Planetary Data System (PDS) announces the third release of Gravity 
Recovery and Interior Laboratory (GRAIL) data. This release includes:

* LGRS RDR - Derived lunar gravitational field data from the GRAIL 
mission, along with SPICE geometry and navigation kernels created 
by the GRAIL Science Data System (SDS). The data were acquired during 
the primary mission phase, from 2012-03-01 through 2012-05-29.

NEW VERSION OF THE AIDA DECONVOLUTION ALGORITHM

An updated and more stable version of AIDA, named AIDA 1.3 has just 
been recently released. AIDA (Hom et al. JOSAA 24 1580-1600,2007) is a 
de novo implementation and extension of the MISTRAL myopic 
deconvolution method developed by Mugnier et al. (2004) (see J. Opt. 
Soc. Am. A 21:1841-1854). These deconvolution algorithms have been 
shown to yield object reconstructions with excellent edge preservation 
and photometric precision on images of planetary targets collected 
with Adaptive Optics systems and Hubble Space Telescope. 

AIDA is free and intended for further open source development 
(Python-based) - please help improve it; we welcome any feedback!
