LPSC WORKSHOP FOR PLANNING YOUR SOLAR SYSTEM OBSERVATIONS WITH JWST

The Science Working Group of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) 
has a dedicated effort to establish the full capabilities of this 
facility for Solar System Science. JWST is an infrared-optimized 
telescope to be placed at the Earth-Sun Lagrange 2 point. It is 
scheduled for launch in 2018, and will have a robust suite of 
astronomical instrumentation available for General Observer 
proposals.

In order to fully realize the maximum potential of JWST for Solar
System observations, we are seeking experienced observers of solar
system targets to participate and provide input in an upcoming
workshop held at the annual LPSC meeting in Houston, Texas on Sunday 
March 17, 2013 (1-5 PM). This workshop will provide you an 
opportunity to learn about the current instrument specifications and 
observing modes, as well as the observatory capabilities (brightness 
limits, moving target tracking, and others). Our goal is to fully 
engage the Solar System community to provide the tools needed to plan 
observations with JWST.  

This workshop is complimentary to the previous one held at the fall 
DPS meeting.

VENUS GAME-CHANGING TECHNOLOGY FORUM AT LPSC - MONDAY, MARCH 18TH

Space technology is a vital tool for both scientists and engineers to 
reach some of the most extreme environments in our solar system. 
Exploring Venus with these technologies can answer key questions 
ranging from the history to the habitability of our universe.    

To help us understand these challenges and to identify technologies 
that may assist you in this quest, we need your help! We would like to 
tell you about Space Technology and listen to your technology needs 
through a dialog in a Town Hall meeting format.

First, we plan to provide an overview of Space Technology and the 
Game-Changing Development Program, including specific examples of 
Venus exploration technology projects currently under development.

Next, we would like to hear from you! Your identified technology needs 
play a significant role in our portfolio planning and could enable 
innovative and exciting future Venus exploration missions.

We are looking forward to seeing y'all at LPSC on Monday March 18, 
from 12:00 to 13:15 in the Panther Creek Room. The forum is hosted by 
the VEXAG and will be run by Steve Gaddis, Director of the 
Game-Changing Development Program, NASA LaRC.

CALL FOR CHAPTERS FOR THE BOOK ASTEROIDS IV: A NEW VOLUME IN THE SPACE
SCIENCE SERIES

Dear Colleagues,

This message is a solicitation for ideas for chapter topics and a 
solicitation for volunteers for chapter authors for the book 
Asteroids IV. If you would like to recommend chapters for the book, or 
would like to volunteer to write a particular chapter as a first 
author, we would like to know no later than March 31st, 2013. The 
Asteroids IV web site includes the call for chapters and instructions 
that can be seen and downloaded:

http://www.oca.eu/michel/ASTEROIDSIV/

The SOC will then make the final choice of chapters, based on the 
received ideas and its own conclusions. Your participation would be an 
extremely valuable service to the asteroid and planetary science 
community. It is our intention to make Asteroids IV as useful as 
Asteroids (1979), Asteroids II (1989), and Asteroids III (2002) such 
that it becomes the science community's primary reference manual for at 
least the next decade, and we hope you will volunteer to participate to 
this challenge.

On behalf of the co-Editors and SOC,

Best regards,

Patrick Michel
Editor, Asteroids IV

"INTRODUCTION TO PLANETARY GEOMORPHOLOGY" BY RONALD GREELEY

Cambridge University Press is pleased to announce a new textbook by the 
late Ron Greeley. The author passed away suddenly shortly after the 
finished typescript was submitted for production. The remaining 
editorial work undertaken up by Ron's former student and close 
colleague, Dr. Robert T. Pappalardo, also assisted by Cynthia Greeley.

The text's introductory chapters describe the planets and other objects 
of planetary geoscience interest. They discuss the methods used to 
study extraterrestrial objects and review the fundamental 
geomorphologic processes that can be compared with what we see on other 
planets and satellites. Key references are given in the text, as well 
as further readings for those who wish to delve into the chapter topics 
in more detail. The book features over 350 figures from Solar System 
missions, demonstrating the features described in the text.

Pappalardo describes "Introduction to Planetary Geomorphology" as 'the 
single most outstanding and complete compendium of the science of 
planetary geology ... written in Greeley's characteristically succinct 
and clear style. This is the ideal primer for an upper-undergraduate 
course and an excellent compendium for the professional astronomer.'
