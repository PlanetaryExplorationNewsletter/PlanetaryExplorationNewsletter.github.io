EDITORIAL - A BUDGET

On March 21, Congress passed a full year FY13 CR to which sequestration
will be applied. For the past six months, the Administration has 
implemented a 20% reduction in the planetary budget (to $1.2B), but 
Congress has raised that to $1.415B. Even with sequestration, planetary 
should do significantly better than Administration plans. Further, 
Congressional direction to increase research and Discovery budgets over 
Administration request sends a strong message about the importance of 
these foundational programs that should be heeded by the Administration 
and NASA management. Record low selection rates over the past two years 
were the predictable consequence of PSD management removing ~$25M from 
research programs in 2010 through "rephasing" to help cover MSL cost 
overruns. The Discovery program has been decimated since the selection 
of Dawn and Kepler in 2001 (the end of a decade selecting two missions 
for flight every two years). The Administration and NASA management 
need to move away from their focus on back-room deals on large projects 
for special interests and pay attention to getting the basics right and 
making them stable. Without this, our solar system exploration program 
and the national capabilities supporting it will irreversably decline.

INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE "COSMIC DUST VI"

August 5-9, 2013

Center for Planetary Science (CPS), Kobe, Japan.

This series of Cosmic Dust meetings aims finding a consensus among 
experts on the formation and evolution of cosmic dust: where it comes 
from and where it goes. The primary objectives of the meeting are to 
bring together professionals who deal with cosmic dust and to provide 
an opportunity for participants to develop human relations and 
interactions between the participants. The meeting considers all kinds 
of cosmic dust: intergalactic and interstellar dust, protoplanetary and 
debris disk dust, cometary, interplanetary and circumplanetary dust, 
planetary aerosols, regolith, micrometeorites, meteors and meteoroids, 
presolar grains and stellar nebular condensates. The meeting is open 
for any aspects of dust research by means of in-situ and laboratory 
measurements, astronomical observations, laboratory and numerical 
analogue simulations, theoretical modeling, data analysis, etc. Any 
dust-related topics, for example, formation of molecules and their 
reactions on and desorption from the surface of dust particles, are 
also welcome. Publishing the proceedings of this meeting is currently 
being planned as a special issue of a peer-reviewed journal.

Deadline for admissions application: 13 May 2013.

MAX PLANCK RESEARCH GROUP LEADER IN COMETARY SCIENCE

The Max Planck Institute for Solar System Research (MPS) offers 
outstanding young scientists the opportunity to set up and lead a Max 
Planck Research Group (MPRG) in the field of cometary research.

In order to foster the scientific exploitation of the Rosetta mission, 
arriving in 2014 at its target comet, the MPS intends to establish a 
new MPRG dedicated to cometary science. The new MPRG leader will have 
the unique chance to play a leading role in the research that is based 
on the Rosetta data. In close collaboration with the several instrument 
teams at the MPS he/she is expected to take advantage of the multiple 
involvements of the MPS in the Rosetta mission and to utilize the 
corresponding synergies in order to answer the key science questions.

The successful candidate will be offered a MPRG for a period of five 
years with the possibility of twice a 2-years extension after 
successful evaluation and subject to financial and legal conditions. 
The group leader will hold a temporary W2 position equivalent to the 
associate professor level. In exceptional cases a tenured W2 position 
can be offered.

[NASA] PLANETARY SCIENCE DIVISION TECHNOLOGY INFUSION REQUEST FOR
INFORMATION (RFI)

Solicitation Number: NNH13ZDA008L
Response Date: April 19, 2013

Through the Technology Infusion RFI the Planetary Science Division at 
NASA seeks to better understand how to realize a scientific return on 
spacecraft system technology investments by soliciting recommendations 
on how to effectively infuse new spacecraft systems technologies that 
it develops into future competed missions, enabling increased 
scientific discoveries, lower mission cost, or both. We are collecting 
input on how to maximize the return on and benefits from current 
technology investments and thereby improve the prospects of the 
inclusion of these investments within future competed missions 
opportunities. We are requesting the community's assessment of 
barriers to technology infusion, e.g., as related to approach, 
technology readiness, documentation, integration, risk considerations, 
and system level impacts. The call contains a series of specific 
questions to be answered, but other volunteered will also be considered.

CHARACTERIZING LUNA INCOGNITA

Monday, April 15, 2013 9:00AM PDT, 12:00 Noon EDT, 16:00 UTC 
Ben Bussey, JHU/APL

The goal of our team is to advance our scientific understanding of the 
Moon's poles and to fill in strategic knowledge gaps that facilitate 
the robotic and human exploration of these areas. Our results provide 
useful data for planning future lunar surface missions. For example we 
have located places near both poles that are constantly illuminated 
for several months around mid-summer. Such locations permit 
long-duration missions that do not have to survive periods of darkness. 
We have mapped regions of permanent shadow as far from the poles as 58 
degrees latitude. This new result dramatically increases the 
opportunities for missions wishing to investigate if these areas 
contain volatiles, a useful resource for future robotic and human 
explorers.

[NASA] TRAVEL RESTRICTIONS UPDATE

Several grantees have indicated that they thought that the 
Administrator's memo on travel restrictions under the sequester applied 
to their grants. For various reasons this is not the case. The memo 
specified only NASA Civil Servants and contractors (especially JPL), it 
did not mention grantees. Those who are on grants are not required to 
skip travel. If anything changes the grantees will be contacted by the 
NASA Shared Services Center. Until then scientists should continue 
their research projects in the normal, fiscally responsible manner they 
did before.
