IN MEMORIAM : FEODOR VELICHKO
 
Feodor Velichko, the Leading Researcher of Institute of Astronomy of 
Kharkiv National University (Ukraine) died suddenly on Oct 1, 2013 in 
the age of 56. He was an expert in photometry and polarimetry of 
asteroids and comets and took part in many international observing 
programs devoted to physical studies of small bodies.

2014 PIERAZZO INTERNATIONAL STUDENT TRAVEL AWARD DEADLINE APPROACHING

This award is established by the Planetary Science Institute in memory 
of Senior Scientist Betty Pierazzo to support and encourage graduate 
students to build international collaborations and relationships in 
planetary science. Two awards will be made each year, contingent upon 
there being meritorious applications. One will be awarded to a graduate 
student working on his or her Ph.D. at an institution within the U.S. 
This is to support travel to a planetary science related meeting 
(conferences and workshops) outside of the U.S. The second award will 
be to a graduate student working on his or her Ph.D. at an institution 
outside of the U.S. This is to support travel to a planetary science 
related meeting within the U.S. These include general meetings that 
have planetary-focused sessions such as the AGU, GSA, EGU and IAG.

The award will consist of a certificate and up to $2000US.

Additional information and application materials are available at:

http://www.psi.edu/pista

Because of the recent U.S. government shutdown, the deadline has been 
extended to November 15. Awards will be announced on or about December
15.

SCIENCE WITH THE HUBBLE SPACE TELESCOPE IV - ABSTRACT SUBMISSION 
DEADLINE EXTENDED TO NOVEMBER 1

Dear Hubble user, out of consideration for our colleagues affected by 
the US government shutdown, we have extended the Abstract Submission 
deadline to November 1.

The conference will be held in Rome, at the prestigious Accademia 
dei Lincei, on March 17-20, 2014, and will be organized by ESA, STScI 
and other partner organizations.

The conference is designed to highlight the scientific breakthroughs 
made by the Hubble Space Telescope in its two decade long life. We have 
three specific goals for this meeting:

- To share the latest results from Hubble across the broad canvas of 
  astronomy,
- To inspire the community of Hubble users to think how Hubble's 
  successor-the James Webb Space Telescope-will move their scientific 
  field forward,
- To look further into the future posing the scientific questions that 
  will shape the field of astrophysics in the next decade.

We will give ample space to new Hubble results. If you are working on a 
new exciting Hubble result, please consider announcing it in Rome. For 
more information, go to:

POSTDOCTORAL POSITION WITH THE MAVEN IUVS TEAM AT U. COLORADO

The Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics (LASP) at the 
University of Colorado Boulder invites applications for a postdoctoral 
research associate position working with the Imaging UltraViolet 
Spectrograph (IUVS) team. IUVS is an instrument on board the MAVEN 
mission (Mars Volatile and Atmosphere EvolutioN), slated for launch in 
November 2013. Minimum qualification is Ph.D. in Planetary Science or 
related field. Responsibilities and duties include: 

(1) Numerical modeling of the Mars atmosphere, including atmospheric 
    structure, photochemistry, escape and emission spectroscopy; 
(2) Preparation of automated data processing pipelines and observation 
    plans; 
(3) Operations support during cruise and on-orbit operations; 
(4) Analysis of data obtained and publication of scientific results.

NASA POSTDOCTORAL FELLOWSHIPS
 
The NASA Postdoctoral Program (NPP) provides opportunities for 
scientists and engineers to conduct research largely of their own 
choosing, yet compatible with the research opportunities posted on the 
NPP Web site.
 
Selected by a competitive peer-review process, NPP Fellows complete 
one- to three-year Fellowship appointments that advance NASA's missions 
in earth science, heliophysics, planetary science, astrophysics, space 
bioscience, aeronautics and engineering, human exploration and space 
operations, and astrobiology.
 
An example of one of the research opportunities in planetary science 
is:
 
https://www3.orau.gov/NPDoc/Catalog/17903    
 
Applicants must have a Ph.D. or equivalent degree in hand before 
beginning the fellowship, but may apply while completing the degree 
requirements. U. S. citizens, Lawful Permanent Residents, and foreign 
nationals eligible for J-1 status as a Research Scholar may apply.
 
Stipends start at $53,500 per year, with supplements for high 
cost-of-living areas and for certain academic specialties. Financial 
assistance is available for relocation and health insurance, and 
$8,000 per year is provided for professional travel.

Applications are accepted three times each year: March 1, July 1, and 
November 1.

APOLLO LUNAR SURFACE EXPERIMENTS PACKAGE (ALSEP) DOCUMENTS AVAILABLE
ONLINE

As part of its work on a NASA-funded Apollo Lunar Surface Experiments 
Package (ALSEP) data recovery project, the Lunar and Planetary 
Institute has scanned a collection of ALSEP-related documents. This 
archive focuses on the development, deployment, and operation of the 
ALSEP experiments and currently includes 210 documents with more than 
17,700 pages of material. These documents include ALSEP Systems 
Handbooks for several of the ALSEP arrays, ALSEP Data Processing 
Procedures, the ALSEP Archive Tape Description Document, and daily 
status reports for the ALSEP network from initial deployment in 1969 
to termination in 1977. The documents can be searched based on key 
words selected by the user. This material is available as part of our 
Lunar Science and Exploration Portal at: 

http://www.lpi.usra.edu/lunar/ALSEP 

Material on this website provides important background information 
about the ALSEP experiments that may be useful to individuals who are 
re-analyzing data obtained from the experiments. However, the archive 
does not include science results from these experiments. LPI intends 
to continue adding other ALSEP-related material to the website on an 
on-going basis.
