AMES RESEARCH CENTER JOB ANNOUNCEMENT AR13B0014, RESEARCH SPACE 
SCIENTIST, AST, PLANETARY STUDIES, GS-1330-12/13

https://www.usajobs.gov/GetJob/ViewDetails/349635800

NASA, the world's leader in space and aeronautics is always seeking 
outstanding scientists, engineers, and other talented professionals to 
carry forward the great discovery process that its mission demands.

The Exobiology Branch (Code SSX) at NASA Ames Research Center is 
currently seeking interested applicants for the position of Research 
Space Scientist. The incumbent is responsible for conducting 
microbiological and/or geologic research to identify biosignatures that 
characterize past/present life in environments related to astrobiology. 
He/she studies the origin, composition, structure, and evolution of 
the solar system, including planets and satellites; the Earth and Moon; 
and meteorites, asteroids, comets and dust. As a Research Space 
Scientist, the incumbent is responsible for conducting research 
involving modern field samples, ancient terrestrial rocks, meteorites, 
extraterrestrial materials, ices, Mars analog rocks, and returned data 
from spaceflight missions. He/she conducts research that emphasizes on 
the elucidation and characterization of modern, ancient, or 
extraterrestrial habitable zones and mineral biosignature. This 
includes the evaluation of preservation potential related to 
biosignatures; primary/secondary mineral phases associated with 
habitable zones; and the development of databases, microbial specimens, 
and geological collections for planetary studies and spacecraft 
missions.

AURORAL PLANETARY IMAGING AND SPECTROSCOPY (APIS) SERVICE
 
Dear all,

The APIS service (for Auroral Planetary Imaging and Spectroscopy) was 
officially opened at the occasion of the Magnetospheres of Outer 
Planets meeting, Athens, 8-12 July 2013. It is now accessible at the 
address: 

http://lesia.obspm.fr/apis/ 

with the support of the Virtual Observatory of Paris.

It consists of a database of all HST Far-UV spectro-imaging 
observations of the outer planets (Jupiter, Saturn and Uranus) 
acquired by the STIS and ACS instruments from 1997 up to now 
(which makes ~5000 individual images and spectra), declined under 
various types of high level data (e.g. cylindrical/polar projections). 
The data are available in different formats (jpg, pdf, fits) and 
can be browsed and sorted out with a dedicated search interface. 
Interactive tools (Aladin, Specview) also enable the user to 
directly work on images and spectra online. 

Please let us know if you have any question, comment or suggestion.

On behalf of the APIS team,
Laurent Lamy

THE LUNAR WORKSHOPS

Cislunar space will be the training ground for the human expansion 
into the solar system in the 21st century. We will learn to work and 
live in space on and around the Moon. We will discover what new science 
awaits us in deep space and how to measure and explore these extreme 
environments by studying Lunar analogs. We will use Cislunar space as 
a staging ground, a resource depot and the gateway for all major deep 
space mission in the furture. In order to attract capital, science, 
technology and excitement to Cislunar space we have created The Lunar 
Workshops.

These workshops will bring together top scientists, engineers, 
investors and entrepreneurs in a highly interactive, collaborative 
environment to discuss what's now and what's next in Lunar exploration.

The Lunar Workshops:

The NASA Postdoctoral Program (NPP) provides opportunities for 
scientists and engineers to conduct research largely of their own 
choosing, yet compatible with the research opportunities posted on the 
NPP Web site.

Selected by a competitive peer-review process, NPP Fellows complete 
one- to three-year Fellowship appointments that advance NASA's 
missions in earth science, heliophysics, planetary science, 
astrophysics, space bioscience, aeronautics and engineering, human 
exploration and space operations, and astrobiology.

For sample opportunities see:

https://www3.orau.gov/NPDoc/Catalog/18713   

Applicants must have a Ph.D. or equivalent degree in hand before 
beginning the fellowship, but may apply while completing the degree 
requirements. U. S. citizens, Lawful Permanent Residents, and foreign 
nationals eligible for J-1 status as a Research Scholar may apply.

Stipends start at $53,500 per year, with supplements for high cost-of-
living areas and for certain academic specialties. Financial assistance
is available for relocation and health insurance, and $8,000 per year 
is provided for professional travel.

SPACE FLIGHT CENTER

The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) Project at NASA's Goddard Space 
Flight Center (GSFC) invites applications through the NASA 
Postdoctoral Program (NPP) to carry out postdoctoral research in 
astrophysics, astronomical instrumentation or planetary science. The 
applicant will work directly with one of the JWST Project Scientists 
and will be resident at GSFC. The science objectives of JWST include 
the initial formation of galaxies in the early Universe, galaxy 
evolution including active galactic nuclei (AGN), star and planetary

48TH ESLAB SYMPOSIUM: NEW INSIGHTS INTO VOLCANISM ACROSS THE SOLAR 
SYSTEM

We are pleased to invite you to the 48th ESLAB Symposium on "New 
insights into volcanism across the Solar System". The Symposium will
take place from 16-20 June 2014 at the European Space Research and 
Technology Centre (ESTEC) located in Noordwijk, The Netherlands.

It will focus on volcanism in the Solar System. Of particular interest, 
but not limited to, will be new insights obtained over the last years 
from international space missions to planets (e.g., MESSENGER, LRO, 
Selene, etc.), Moons and cryo-volcanism. The connection with Earth by 
will be covered by experts on terrestrial volcanism.

The format will be made up of plenary sessions on topics related to 
volcanism in the Solar System, with contributed oral and poster 
presentations. Part of the Symposium may be devoted to parallel 
sessions on specialized topics where details can be discussed at 
greater length. This will depend on the response to the Call for 
Papers.

Other information is available at: 

http://congrexprojects.com/2014-events/48-ESLAB/

Pre-registration is already available on this website which will ensure 
that you receive regular updates from the Symposium organisers.

Financial support may be available for students.

MARS CRITICAL DATA PRODUCTS PROGRAM (ROUND VIII) - COMET SIDING SPRING 
MODELING

The Mars Exploration Program has issued, in August 2013, a Request for 
Proposal for round VIII of the Mars Critical Data Products program. 
This RFP provides support of the modeling the dust and particle 
environment of Comet 2013 A1 (Siding Spring) during its encounter with 
Mars in October 2014. The intent is to provide data products useful 
for risk assessment and mitigation strategy development for the Mars 
orbiter missions, due to possible impacts from dust and ion tail 
particles as this comet encounters Mars. Proposals are due on 
Wednesday, September 11, 2013.

NEW BOOK ON PLANETARY GEOLOGY

Now available from Dunedin Academic Press, "Planetary Geology: An 
Introduction (Second Edition)" [ISBN 9781780460154 - $49.50] is written 
by Claudio Vita-Finzi and Dominic Fortes. Recent planetary missions by 
NASA, the European Space Agency, and other national agencies have 
reaffirmed that the geological processes which are familiar from our 
studies of the Earth operate on many solid planets and satellites. 
Common threads link the internal structure, thermal evolution, and 
surface character of both rocky and icy worlds. Volcanoes, impact 
craters, ice caps, dunes, rift valleys, rivers, and oceans are 
features of extra-terrestrial worlds as diverse as Mercury and Titan. 
"Planetary Geology" provides students and armchair enthusiasts with 
comprehensive coverage of the solar system viewed through the eyes 
of Earth scientists. This comprehensively updated second edition 
presents fresh evidence that planetary geology now embraces 
conventional geology and vice versa. Great for classes, the book 
contains numerous color illustrations. Place orders with Dunedin's
