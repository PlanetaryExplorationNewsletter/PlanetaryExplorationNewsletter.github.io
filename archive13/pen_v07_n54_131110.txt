EDITORIAL - NASA PLANETARY R&A REORGANIZATION

Mark V. Sykes
Planetary Science Institute

NASA (and the Administration) has not had a good track record of late, 
putting the cart way before the horse with the recent EPO 
reorganization debacle, Mars 2020, and the Asteroid Retrieval Mission. 
Sometimes plans can go awry, as with the rephasing of research awards
in 2010 to free up money to cover an MSL cost overrun. Failure to cover 
those rephased obligations in subsequent years was the primary reason 
for a collapse in proposal selection rates.

The planetary research and analysis programs, along with mission data 
analysis programs, support most of the US planetary community. Their
streamlining could provide benefits. A misstep could permanently damage 
US solar system exploration capability. The plan laid out by Jim Green 
is very vague:

http://www.lpi.usra.edu/pss/nov2013/Green__Rall_PSS_Nov%20_2013.pdf
 
(beginning on slide 41). Its implementation is premature. So, it is 
very good that NASA is reaching out to the community for input. This 
should be the first step in a more extended process that will 
transparently and iteratively add important details and well-defined 
improvements to any reorganization plan. It is far more important to 
get it right, than to rush and cause harm.

REQUEST FOR QUESTIONS REGARDING PLANETARY SCIENCE R&A RESTRUCTURING

At the Planetary Science Subcommittee (PSS) meeting on November 5, 
there was a presentation describing a plan to restructure the existing 
planetary science R&A programs. The slides that were presented are 
online:

http://www.lpi.usra.edu/pss/nov2013 /

The slides discussing the plan are contained in the presentation 
listed for Jim Green and start on slide #41.

The PSS has suggested that each Assessment Group (AG) gather and 
compile questions, comments, and concerns that the community may 
have regarding the R&A restructuring plan and for each AG to send the 
compilation to Jim Green. 

All questions, big and small, general or specific, are welcomed.

For CAPTEM, email Hap McSween  (mcsween@utk.edu)
For LEAG, email Jeff Plescia (Jeffrey.Plescia@jhuapl.edu)
For MEPAG, email Serina Diniega (Serina.Diniega@jpl.nasa.gov)
For OPAG, email: Candy Hansen (cjhansen@psi.edu)
For SBAG, email: Nancy Chabot (Nancy.Chabot@jhuapl.edu)
For VEXAG, email: Lori Glaze (Lori.S.Glaze@nasa.gov)

In the compilation, the identities of those providing the comments 
will be removed, but the final compiled reports may be posted on AG 
websites. Please indicate in your reply if you do not want your 
comment included in a compilation (with identities removed) on the web.

ICARUS SPECIAL ISSUE - THE PLUTO SYSTEM

An Icarus special issue on Pluto system science will be published in
2014. The pace of discovery about the Pluto system has accelerated
continually since its discovery in 1930, and we are now on the doorstep
of the most dramatic advances yet, with the system's exploration by
NASA's New Horizons probe in 2015. New Horizons, equipped with a
powerful suite of scientific instruments, will explore Pluto and its
complex system of moons and potential rings/dust assemblages. The
encounter will herald the exploration of the newly recognized planetary
class called ice dwarfs, prevalent in the outer solar system.  This
special issue sets the stage for the encounter, with scientific papers
on:

+ New results from observations, theoretical modeling, and laboratory
  studies relevant to the Pluto system
+ Pre-encounter predictions of Pluto system properties and processes
+ Investigations into the implications of Pluto system science for
  broader outer Solar System studies

All are welcome to contribute.

The submission deadline is December 20. Go to:

http://ees.elsevier.com/icarus 

and select "Special Issue: Pluto System" under manuscript type. 

Special issue editors: Will Grundy, Alan Stern, Fran Bagenal, Randy
Gladstone, and Bonnie Buratti.

PLANETARY MISSION RESEARCH SCIENTIST AT NASA JSC: APPLICANTS MUST 
REAPPLY
 
Because of the government shutdown, applicants for our Planetary 
Mission Research Scientist position in NASA Johnson Space Center's 
Astromaterials Research Office must, unfortunately, reapply to a new 
position number within USAJobs.gov. The previous position posting has 
been cancelled and a new (identical) one is now available until 12 
November 2013 at the link below. APPLICANTS MUST REAPPLY REGARDLESS OF 
WHETHER THEY SUCCESSFULLY SUBMITTED PRIOR TO THE SHUTDOWN. In addition, 
no record of who applied was acquired while USAJobs.gov was unmonitored 
during the shutdown, so there is no way for the Agency to contact those 
applicants to inform them of this situation. Accordingly please share 
this notice so that we can give all applicants the opportunity to have 
their materials properly received. Thanks!

The new position number is JS14D0002 and the position posting for 
application can be accessed at:

FAMELAB: EXPLORING EARTH AND BEYOND

FameLab is something like American Idol for scientists. Sponsored by 
NASA and National Geographic, it's a fun-filled day of competition, 
coaching, and camaraderie that's all about science communication! Early 
career scientists from diverse scientific disciplines craft a 3-minute, 
powerpoint-free talk on their research or a related topic and deliver 
it in a supportive environment to judges who give only constructive 
feedback. No slides, no charts - just the power of words and any prop 
you can hold in your hands. The heart of the whole thing is a workshop 
conducted by communication professionals to help participants enrich 
their skills.

See video clips of prior FameLabbers: 

http://famelab-eeb.arc.nasa.gov/competitions/

We've had 4 regional competitions so far in "Season 2" here in the US, 
and our next one is at the AGU annual meeting in San Francisco on 
Sunday, December 8th.

Winners from the regional competitions advance to the Final at National 
Geographic in DC in April, 2014, and the winner there goes on to 
FameLab International Final in the UK in June, 2014.

Even if you're not planning to attend AGU, you're welcome to 
participate.

FREE SMARTPHONE APP FOR TRACKING FIREBALLS

We've developed a smartphone app that allows anyone to report a 
fireball sighting anywhere in the world. Its designed so that we can 
potentially get data of sufficient quality to create a crowd source 
smartphone fireball network. Its free, fun to use (we hope!), and it 
has a very easy interface - simply point at the sky where you think 
the fireball started and click on your phone, and do the same for where 
you think it ended. You can then input a variety of other data. If we 
get enough observations we can determine a trajectory and send that 
information back to you - for instance, you might get a message that 
the rock that made your fireball came from the outer asteroid belt, or 
that it was a chunk of a comet. The app also includes images and 
updates from our project: 

http://www.fireballsinthesky.com.au 

It is available for both iOS and Android: 

https://itunes.apple.com/au/app/fireballs-in-the-sky/id709019924?mt=8
https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tw.fireballs 

or just search for 'fireballs in the sky' on app stores. Let us know if 
you have any problems, or suggestions for improvements. Hope you have 
fun with it!

ALMA CYCLE 2 CALL FOR PROPOSALS

The ALMA Director, on behalf of the partner organizations and all the
personnel in Chile, East Asia, Europe, and North America involved in
bringing ALMA to Early Science readiness, is pleased to issue the Cycle
2 Call for Proposals.

We invite members of the astronomy community to propose programs to be 
scheduled within the ALMA Early Science Cycle 2 period which will start 
in June 2014. This provides a new important opportunity for Early 
Science from this cutting edge facility. The Cycle 2 period will span 
17 months and users of any professional background, nationality, or 
affiliation may submit proposals. It is anticipated that about 2000 
hours of 12-m Array time and ACA time will be available for Cycle 2 
projects and highest priority projects transferred from Cycle 1. A list 
of the metadata from Cycle 1 proposals designated for transfer into 
Cycle 2 has been posted to the ALMA Science Portal, so that Cycle 2 
PIs can avoid duplicating these observations.

The ALMA Cycle 2 proposal submission deadline is 15:00 UT, 5 December 
2013.

For details, please see the ALMA Call for Proposals:
