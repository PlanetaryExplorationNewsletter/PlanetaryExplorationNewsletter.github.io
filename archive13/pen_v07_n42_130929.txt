IN MEMORIAM: GARY BRUCE HANSEN (1953-2013)

Gary Hansen died peacefully at home Thursday night from ALS. Gary had
been suffering from the disease for several years as he continued to 
work and attend conferences. Gary received a BSc in Engineering and 
Applied Science from the California Institute of Technology in 1975,
an M.S. in Aeronautics and Astronautics in 1986, and a Ph.D. in 
Geophysics from the University of Washington in 1996, under the 
tutelage of Steve Warren, determining the optical constants of carbon 
dioxide ice from the near through far infrared. His specialty became 
radiative transfer, especially in multi-scattering media, such as CO2 
and H2O ices. He worked with both the Galileo NIMS and Cassini VIMS 
teams with Tom McCord, contributing greatly to the calibration and 
analyses of the data sets from those instruments. He lived in Seattle, 
Washington where he was a research scientist with the University of 
Washington and is survived by a brother and his father. We will miss 
him; Gary was both a good scientist and a caring person.

Composed by K. Hibbitts with contributions by Tom McCord.

[NASA] PROPOSAL WRITING PRACTICUM AT DPS

The Planetary Science Division at NASA Headquarters will be offering a 
proposal writing workshop at the 45th Annual Meeting of the Division 
for Planetary Sciences in Denver, CO. This Proposal Writing Practicum 
is based on the cumulative experience of current and former Discipline 
Scientists who have managed a variety of Research and Announcement 
(R&A) programs at NASA Headquarters. The specific focus of this 
intense, educational session is to provide a greater understanding of 
NASA's research programs and review process and offer constructive 
insight into writing an effective research proposal. The event is open 
to all at no charge. All interested planetary scientists, from 
graduate students through emeritus professors, are encouraged to 
attend. To register, send an e-mail with your name, affiliation, and 
current position to curt.niebur@nasa.gov. The workshop will be held on 
Sunday, Oct. 6, from 1-5 pm in the Governor's Square 17 room at the 
Sheraton Denver Downtown (the host venue for the DPS conference).
 
Event Type: Workshop
Organizer: Curt Niebur
Location: Governor's Square 17

Notice of Intent Due Date: October 15, 2013
Proposal Due Date: December 23, 2013
 
The full text of the AO and any appendices are available at: 

http://solicitation.nasaprs.com/Mars2020 

Links to the AO and additional information are located at the 
Mars 2020 Acquisition Website: 

http://soma.larc.nasa.gov/mars2020
 
Investigations comprised of individual instruments or multiple 
instruments (suites) may respond to the overall Mars 2020 objectives 
to explore and quantitatively assess Mars as a potential habitat for 
life, to search for signs of past life, to collect carefully selected 
samples for possible future return to Earth, and to prepare for future
human exploration of Mars.
 
This AO solicits flight investigations for which each PI is responsible 
for a complete space flight investigation, including instrument 
hardware, mission operations, and data analysis. 

The total allocated cost for all the SMD-funded investigations selected 
is ~$100M for Phases A-D. Additional funding of ~$60M is allocated for 
Phase E. Additionally, exploration technology investigations, jointly 
funded by the HEOMD and STMD may be selected at a total cost of ~$30M, 
including Phase E costs.

NASA POSTDOCTORAL FELLOWSHIPS
 
The NASA Postdoctoral Program (NPP) provides opportunities for 
scientists and engineers to conduct research largely of their own 
choosing, yet compatible with the research opportunities posted on the 
NPP Web site.
 
Selected by a competitive peer-review process, NPP Fellows complete 
one- to three-year Fellowship appointments that advance NASA's missions 
in earth science, heliophysics, planetary science, astrophysics, space 
bioscience, aeronautics and engineering, human exploration and space 
operations, and astrobiology.
 
An example of one of the research opportunities in planetary science 
is:
 
https://www3.orau.gov/NPDoc/Catalog/17903    
 
Applicants must have a Ph.D. or equivalent degree in hand before 
beginning the fellowship, but may apply while completing the degree 
requirements. U. S. citizens, Lawful Permanent Residents, and foreign 
nationals eligible for J-1 status as a Research Scholar may apply.
 
Stipends start at $53,500 per year, with supplements for high 
cost-of-living areas and for certain academic specialties. Financial 
assistance is available for relocation and health insurance, and 
$8,000 per year is provided for professional travel.

Applications are accepted three times each year: March 1, July 1, and 
November 1.

VEXAG MEETING #11 PREVIEW - REQUEST FOR COMMUNITY COMMENTS ON UPDATED 
VENUS EXPLORATION GOALS, OBJECTIVES, INVESTIGATIONS
 
As a follow-up to last November's VEXAG Meeting recommendations, an 
update to VEXAG's Venus Exploration Goals, Objectives, and 
Investigations has been drafted. The primary difference between this 
draft and the prior version is a restructuring of the overall Goals. 
The prioritized objectives and investigations retain their strong link 
to priorities identified in the Decadal Survey. An accompanying 
document providing additional detail for each investigation is 
currently being drafted and will be available for comment during the 
November 2013 VEXAG meeting. 
 
The new draft table of updated VEXAG's Venus Exploration Goals, 
Objectives, and Investigations has been posted on the VEXAG website 
along with a form for submitting comments. Community comments (with a 
deadline of November 1, 2013) are being solicited at the VEXAG 
Web-Site Home Page: 

http://www.lpi.usra.edu/vexag/

Colorado is getting back to it's usually dry and sunny weather. Come 
enjoy the science and the scenery! You can still register for the 
meeting and you can also register at the meeting. 

Due to the difficult situation some NASA colleagues are facing this 
year, we will not reinforce the prior registration policy. Note then 
that you will be able to also register on site. Volunteers that sign 
up to work a minimum of 16 hours receive complimentary meeting 
registration.

PANEL DISCUSSION ON EPO AT DPS:

You're invited to attend a lunchtime panel discussion on "The Future of 
Education & Public Outreach" to be held during the Denver DPS meeting. 
Massive changes to E/PO have been proposed that impact the way that our 
work as planetary scientists makes its way to the classrooms and to the 
general public. The panel discussion will include a review of those 
plans, their current status, and a discussion on what lies ahead. 
Panelists include Jim Green, NASA/SMD; Heidi Hammel, incoming DPS 
chair; Maria Womack, NSF, and other members of the E/PO community to be 
confirmed. The event will take place on Wednesday, 9 October from 
12:30-1:30 in the Governors Square 15 meeting room in the Sheraton. 
The event will be recorded and made available online after the event for 
those unable to attend in person.

PRO-AM WORKSHOP AT DPS:

Thurs. Oct. 10th at 6:00pm. 

DPS is experimenting with a professional-amateur workshop where 
professionals present what opportunities are out there for 
collaborations with NASA missions and amateurs show samples of their 
observations. Examples: observing Pluto during New Horizons flyby, 
observing Jupiter's clouds while Juno flies over the poles, taking 
images of comet ISON to find time-variability, light-curves of 
asteroids, follow-up on NEOs, searches for Moon impacts (perhaps 
related to LADEE), Mars observations during MAVEN, etc, etc, etc). 
Participants wishing to present (5 mns, 5 slides) send title & 
description (<200 words) to frbagenal@gmail.com. 

Organizer: Fran Bagenal, University of Colorado.
