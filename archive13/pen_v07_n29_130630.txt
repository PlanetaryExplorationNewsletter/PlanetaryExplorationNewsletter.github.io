HIGH PRIORITY INVESTIGATIONS FOR VENUS EXPLORATION SPECIAL SESSION AT 
FALL AGU MEETING

2014 will mark 25 years since NASA last launched a mission to Venus. 
The next call for NASA Discovery Mission proposals is quickly 
approaching and Venus is well suited as a target for this class of 
Mission. This special session will frame the current state of Venus 
science in terms of outstanding questions and how they can be 
addressed through future missions. Submissions should summarize new 
results, the state of knowledge, and investigations that address areas 
such as: origin and evolution of the Venus interior; surface processes 
including volcanism, tectonics, and impact cratering; and processes 
governing the atmosphere's thermal structure, composition, and 
dynamics. Contributions should address the themes of the Planetary 
Science Decadal Survey.

Conveners: Ellen Stofan, Robbie Herrick, Lori Glaze, David Crisp

TRAINING OPPORTUNITY - PHOTOGRAMMETRIC PROCESSING OF PLANETARY IMAGERY
USING ISIS AND SOCET SET

The Planetary Photogrammetry Guest Facility at the Astrogeology Science 
Center of USGS would like to announce a training opportunity on 
September 23-25, 2013, on Photogrammetric Processing of Planetary 
Imagery using ISIS and SOCET SET. The training covers end-to-end, hands
-on photogrammetric procedures for surface extraction from HiRISE 
images and data exchange between ISIS and SOCET SET.

Seats are limited, so if you are interested in participating in this 
opportunity, please send an email to Dr. Raad Saleh 
(PlanetaryPhotogrammetry@usgs.gov) with contact information and a 
statement describing interest in the training. 

Please note:
1. The training is based exclusively on a standard set of HiRISE 
   stereopairs.
2. While this training is based on HiRISE images, it would be our 
   pleasure to advise participants on other planetary cameras for their 
   projects. 
3. If you would like to stay longer or visit later to generate your 
   DTMs, please let us know.
4. If you are interested in ISIS training, please see:

[NASA] ASTROBIOLOGY SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY FOR EXPLORING PLANETS WILL 
NOT BE SOLICITED IN ROSES-13

When the ROSES-2013 omnibus solicitation was released, the 
Astrobiology Science and Technology for Exploring Planets (ASTEP) 
program included a notice at the top that said in part "NASA may 
solicit research proposals under this program..." and the due dates 
were listed as "TBD." We regret to inform proposers that ASTEP will 
not be solicited in ROSES-13 due to a lack of funding.

Solicitation: NNH13ZDA001N

SOLID EARTH: THE EGU-OPEN ACCESS JOURNAL WELCOMES PLANETARY SUBMISSIONS

Dear Colleagues,

The EGU Open Access Journal "Solid Earth" (http://solid-earth.net) has 
recently started welcoming planetary contributions. In addition to 
terrestrial studies, the journal now focuses also on endogenic 
processes, interior and interior/surface interaction of and on solid 
Solar System bodies.

The journal follows an Open Access policy and all published articles 
are available for free, and now has received its first Impact 
Factor (1.371).

SE journal homepage: 

http://solid-earth.net

Submission information:

Please, do not hesitate to contact us if you need more information 
or if you consider contributing with a paper.

IMPACT GEOLOGY - M.S. THESIS RESEARCH OPPORTUNITY

Auburn University's Dept. of Geology and Geography - There is presently 
an opportunity for a new graduate student who wants to pursue a 
Masters in geology (M.S.) degree with emphasis on impact geology.

and/or Mars. There is a two-year teaching assistantship associated 
with this opportunity. Qualified candidates must act quickly to pass

NASA POSTDOCTORAL FELLOWSHIPS

The NASA Postdoctoral Program (NPP) provides opportunities for 
scientists and engineers to conduct research largely of their own 
choosing, yet compatible with the research opportunities posted on 
the NPP Web site. An example of one of the research opportunities 
in planetary science is:

https://www3.orau.gov/NPDoc/Catalog/17903

Selected by a competitive peer-review process, NPP Fellows complete 
one- to three-year Fellowship appointments that advance NASA's 
missions in earth science, heliophysics, planetary science, 
astrophysics, space bioscience, aeronautics and engineering, human 
exploration and space operations, and astrobiology.

Applicants must have a Ph.D. or equivalent degree in hand before 
beginning the fellowship, but may apply while completing the degree 
requirements. U. S. citizens, Lawful Permanent Residents, and 
foreign nationals eligible for J-1 status as a Research Scholar may 
apply.

Stipends start at $53,500 per year, with supplements for high cost-
of-living areas and for certain academic specialties. Financial 
assistance is available for relocation and health insurance, and 
$8,000 per year is provided for professional travel.

Applications are accepted three times each year: March 1, July 1, and
November 1.

NEW HORIZONS ENCOUNTER HAZARD UPDATE

Alan Stern (SwRI) & Hal Weaver (JHU/APL)

The New Horizons Project recently completed a 1.5-year study of the 
potential dust impact hazard from small-satellite-generated debris 
as the spacecraft flies through the Pluto system in July 2015.

This study concluded that the probability of a mission-ending dust 
impact is <0.3% if the spacecraft follows the current baseline plan, 
far below some early, more conservative estimates. Thus, the 
expectation is that the NH spacecraft will follow this baseline plan, 
with a close approach of ~12,500 km from the surface of Pluto.

However, two alternative plans (SHBOTs, for Safe Haven By Other 
Trajectories) are also being developed to mitigate the (however-
unlikely) possibility that new knowledge indicates the hazard risk is 
greater than predicted.

One plan, GIS (Generic Inner SHBOT), has essentially the same 
trajectory as the baseline, but with the spacecraft turned so that the 
antenna faces the incoming dust particles ("Antenna-To-Ram", or ATR), 
thereby protecting the spacecraft underneath. The other plan, DIS 
(Deep Inner SHBOT), would also use ATR attitude as protection, but 
would additionally divert the trajectory to within ~3000 km of Pluto's 
surface, where atmospheric drag removes dust on very short timescales.

FINAL ANNOUNCEMENT - TARGET NEO 2 WORKSHOP

July 9, 2013
8AM - 6PM

National Academy of Sciences Building
2101 Constitution Ave, NW
Washington, DC

Target NEO 2 is the follow-on to the highly successful Target NEO 
Workshop held in February, 2011. This workshop supports the development
of a robust human exploration program by ensuring that the technical 
viewpoints of experts in fields pertinent to robotic and human NEO 
exploration are provided and documented. Key questions: What are the 
technical challenges involved and what new capabilities are needed for 
the newly proposed Asteroid Retrieval Mission (ARM)? Are there any 
alternative approaches? What technical information is still needed to 
support and sustain a robust human exploration program to a NEO?

Registration is free. To register, view the agenda, and obtain 
additional information, go to:
