This is an open invitation to attend an LPSC lunch seminar Monday, 
March 18th at 12 noon in the Woodlands Room, titled "Golden Spike 
Human Lunar Expeditions: Overview and Science Input Forum." In this 
seminar Alan Stern will provide an overview of Golden Spike's planned 
human lunar expedition capabilities and business model. Following the

PLANETARY ATMOSPHERES RESEARCHER (GSFC/CRESST/UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND)

The NASA Goddard Space Flight Center's (GSFC) Planetary Environments
Laboratory, in conjunction with the Center for Research and Exploration 
in Space Science and Technology (CRESST), is soliciting applications 
for a researcher in the field of Planetary Atmospheres to support 
Mars upper atmosphere investigations with the MAVEN mission. 
Additional details are available at:

http://www.astro.umd.edu/employment/

Candidates should have a Ph.D. in a relevant discipline with a strong 
and demonstrated interest in and understanding of upper atmospheric 
physics. IDL skills and experience in acquisition and analysis of data 
from space flight instruments are highly desirable.

The University of Maryland is an equal opportunity employer. All
applications received by Monday, April 22, 2013 will receive full

DESTINATION: EUROPA 

Destination: Europa is a new organization, affiliated with the SETI 
Institute, whose goals are to promote interest in outer solar system 
science among the general public and advocate for funding of a new 
Europa mission. We have just launched a website:

europa.seti.org

for blog, and social media presence. In the first 24 hours, our 
Facebook page received over 300 "likes", showing that there is 
widespread interest and support for this effort! In order to keep 
up interest in the site, we are currently seeking people to contribute 
content to the blog. There are several options for contributing, 
including:

- An editorial-style article on the benefits of a Europa mission
- A single slide "nugget" presenting an interesting Europa (or 
  related) result
- A link to an interesting science article, within the public domain, 
  along with a few words relating it to Europa

If you are interested in contributing to this effort, please email 
Alyssa Rhoden at planetarygal@gmail.com for more information. We 
are also happy to hear additional ideas for content/distribution 
and feedback on the website itself.
