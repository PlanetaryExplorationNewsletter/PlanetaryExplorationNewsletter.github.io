UPDATE - LUNGRADCON 2013 - VIRTUAL WORKSHOP

Registration is now open for the 4th Annual Lunar Graduate Conference 
(LunGradCon 2013) to be held on Wednesday, July 10th, prior to the NASA 
Lunar Science Forum. This year LunGradCon will be entirely virtual and 
held from 9:00AM-2:00PM PDT (tentative). Participants can choose to 
join in using Adobe Connect, Google+ HangOuts, or a call-in polycom 
system. LunGradCon is organized to provide an opportunity for graduate 
students and early-career postdocs to present their research in a 
low-stress, friendly environment, being critiqued only by their peers. 
In keeping with the future direction of the NLSI, we encourage 
participation from all students and postdocs investigating the Moon, 
Near Earth Asteroids, Phobos and Deimos, and the near space 
environments of these target bodies.

AVAILABILITY OF COSMIC DUST PARTICLES COLLECTED "DRY"

Since 1981, NASA has continuously collected interplanetary dust 
particles (IDPs) in the lower stratosphere by inertial impact onto 
silicone oil-coated flat plate collectors deployed underneath the wings 
of high-altitude aircraft. The highly viscous oil captures and holds 
particles, but also contaminates the grains with some organics. Based 
on a collection scheme utilizing polyurethane foam, and pioneered by 
Scott Messenger (NASA JSC) [Messenger et al. (2012) 43rd Lunar and 
Planetary Science Conference, abstract #2696], we now offer samples 
from two collectors that sampled the lower stratosphere from October 
2012 to January 2013.

Workers are invited to request samples of these polyurethane 
collectors, as they normally would for cosmic dust from NASA's Cosmic 
Dust Curator. There are no deadlines for sample requests, and all 
sample requests must first be approved by a peer review, as always. 
Please visit the Cosmic Dust Curation website for complete details:

NASA POSTDOCTORAL FELLOWSHIPS

The NASA Postdoctoral Program (NPP) offers scientists and engineers 
unique opportunities to conduct research at NASA Centers. Each NPP 
fellowship opportunity is designed to advance NASA research in a 
specific project related to space science, earth science, aeronautics, 
exploration systems, lunar science, astrobiology, or astrophysics.

Applicants must have a Ph.D. or equivalent degree in hand before 
beginning the fellowship, but may apply while completing the degree 
requirements. U. S. citizens, Lawful Permanent Residents, and foreign 
nationals eligible for J-1 status as a Research Scholar may apply.

Stipends start at $53,500 per year, with supplements for high 
cost-of-living areas and for certain academic specialties. Financial 
assistance is available for relocation and health insurance, and 
$8,000 per year is provided for professional travel.

Applications are accepted three times each year: March 1, July 1, 
and November 1.

DEADLINE JUNE 3

The 10th Low Cost Planetary Missions organizing committee would like to 
announce that the program has been finalized and is available at the 
meeting website:

http://lcpm10.caltech.edu

LCPM-10 will take place on the campus of Caltech in Pasadena, CA, 
June 18-20 2013. We have over 80 oral and poster presentations by 
leading scientists, engineers, technologists, and international agency

"EARTH: EVOLUTION OF A HABITABLE WORLD" BY JONATHAN I. LUNINE

Cambridge University Press is pleased to announce the second edition of 
Jonathan Lunine's well-received textbook. Fully updated throughout, 
including revised illustrations and new images from space missions, 
this new edition provides an overview of Earth's history from a 
planetary science perspective for Earth and planetary science 
undergraduates. Earth's evolution is described in the context of what 
we know about other planets and the cosmos at large, from the origin of 
the cosmos to the processes that shape planetary environments and from 
the origins of life to the inner workings of cells. New end-of-chapter 
summaries and questions allow students to check their understanding and 
critical thinking is emphasized to encourage students to explore ideas 
scientifically for themselves.

Professor Chris Impey, University Distinguished Professor, University of 
Arizona says: "The keenly awaited second edition of Lunine's book does 
not disappoint. The clarity of writing and level of scholarship remain 
high, and there is no other treatment of our planet with this 
interdisciplinary breadth."
