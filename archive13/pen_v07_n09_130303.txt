[NASA] FAMELAB: EXPLORING EARTH AND BEYOND

From: Jim Green, Director, Planetary Science NASA HQ

Dear Colleagues,

Communicating our science is a fundamental responsibility we have to 
those on whose behalf we do our work. FameLab is an exciting 
initiative in my organization that helps our young investigators learn 
the value of and best practices in communication at a critical point 
in their careers.  

We are hosting a FameLab event at the LPSC meeting later this month, 
and I encourage all early career scientists in our community to 
participate on Sunday, March 17th. I will personally be hosting the 
final competition round on Wednesday, March 20th. I hope to see all our 
young investigators there, as well as their mentors, showing their 
support!

More information and registration for FameLab is here:

Thanks,

Jim

NASA POSTDOCTORAL FELLOWSHIPS

The NASA Postdoctoral Program (NPP) offers scientists and engineers 
unique opportunities to conduct research at NASA Centers. Each NPP 
fellowship opportunity is designed to advance NASA research in a 
specific project related to space science, earth science, aeronautics, 
exploration systems, lunar science, astrobiology, or astrophysics.

Applicants must have a Ph.D. or equivalent degree in hand before 
beginning the fellowship, but may apply while completing the degree 
requirements. U. S. citizens, Lawful Permanent Residents, and foreign 
nationals eligible for J-1 status as a Research Scholar may apply.

Stipends start at $53,500 per year, with supplements for high 
cost-of-living areas and for certain academic specialties. Financial 
assistance is available for relocation and health insurance, and 
$8,000 per year is provided for professional travel.

Applications are accepted three times each year: March 1, July 1, and 
November 1.

UPCOMING DEADLINE FOR HAYABUSA SAMPLE REQUEST PROPOSALS

The International AO for HAYABUSA Sample Analysis has been issued by 
JAXA and the sample request proposal deadline has been extended to 
March 9, 2013. Since these Hayabusa sample requests to JAXA are only 
issued once every year, please take this opportunity to propose. 
Persons who register at the following website can upload a proposal on 
the site until the deadline. Go to:

http://hayabusaao.isas.jaxa.jp/

The registration deadline is 5 March. Note that this is before the 
proposal deadline of March 9!

Sincerely,

Second International AO Committee for Hayabusa-Returned Samples

[NASA] PDS MSL DATA RELEASE

The NASA Planetary Data System announces Release 1 from the Mars 
Science Laboratory (MSL) mission, covering data from Sols 0-89, 
August 6 - November 5, 2012.

This release takes place in two parts. Part 1, February 27, 2013, 
includes raw data sets from the following instruments: APXS, ChemCam, 
DAN, Hazcam, Navcam, REMS and SPICE. Part 2, March 20, 2013, includes 
derived data sets for the above instruments, along with CheMin and RAD 
raw and derived data, and SAM derived data. Release 1 does not include 
data from the MAHLI, MARDI, or Mastcam instruments.

Links to MSL data sets are on the PDS Geosciences Node web site: 

http://pds-geosciences.wustl.edu/missions/msl/ 

and on the PDS home page:

http://pds.nasa.gov/ 

MSL data are archived at the PDS Atmospheres, Planetary Plasma 
Interactions (PPI), Geosciences, Imaging, and Navigation and Ancillary 
Information Facility (NAIF) Nodes.

PDS offers two services for searching the MSL archives: The Planetary 
Image Atlas at the Imaging Node allows selection of MSL image data by 
specific search criteria: 

http://pds-imaging.jpl.nasa.gov/search

The MSL Analyst's Notebook at the Geosciences Node allows access to 
all MSL data in the context of mission events:

10TH IAA LOW-COST PLANETARY MISSIONS CONFERENCE (LCPM-10)

The 10th International Academy of Astronautics Low-Cost Planetary 
Missions Conference (LCPM-10) will be held on the campus of the 
California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, California, on 
June 18-20, 2013.

The focus of the 10th Low-Cost Planetary Missions Conference is on 
missions characterized by those of NASA's Discovery program and ESA's 
Cosmic Visions Medium-Class program. These missions of scientific 
exploration are conducted at a fixed cost that includes spacecraft and 
science payload development, launch, operations, science data analysis, 
and all relevant mission-specific technology development. 

The conference is a forum for planetary scientists, technologists, 
engineers, project managers and agency officials to gather for the 
exchange of information and ideas for making this class of robotic 
mission richer scientifically while remaining affordably low-cost. 

LCPM-10 will be followed on June 21, 2013, by an IAA-sponsored 
symposium celebrating the life and many accomplishments of Theodore 
von Karman. The von Karman symposium will also to be held on the 
Caltech Campus in Pasadena.

UWINGU INVITES THE PUBLIC TO NOMINATE NAMES FOR PLANETS AROUND FAR AWAY 
STARS

Space start-up Uwingu announces the launch of its fully commercial
website at:

http://www.uwingu.com

The worldwide public can enter names for planets around other stars 
into a database that astronomers and others can use to name far away 
planets. Much of the proceeds from these name nominations will be
contributed to The Uwingu Fund to support space exploration, research, 
and education.

"Astronomers estimate our galaxy harbors 160 billion or more planets. 
That's more than 20 planets for every living person on Earth," says 
astronomer and Uwingu CEO Dr. Alan Stern. He added, "This is a first
step in democratizing planet naming. It's a new way for the people of
Earth, of every age, nation, and walk of life to personally
connect to space discoveries."

People can nominate "exoplanet" names for their favorite town, or 
country, their favorite sports team, music artist, or hero, their 
favorite author, their company, loved ones and friends, or even 
themselves.

Individual Uwingu planet name nominations cost $4.99; there is no limit
on the number of nominations a person or entity can sponsor. Uwingu 
makes volume discounts available to purchasers of blocks of names.
