JEFFREY K. WAGNER (MARCH 11, 1952 - JULY 8, 2013)

It is with great sadness that we announce the death from brain cancer  
of Dr. Jeffrey K. Wagner, Professor of Astronomy and Geology at  
Bowling Green State University Firelands College.  Jeff's name is  
familiar to everyone in the field of spectroscopy of planetary  
surfaces.  His seminal work on the ultraviolet reflectances of  
planetary materials, which formed his Ph.D dissertation, opened a new  
field in planetary spectroscopy, and his  papers resulting from his  
thesis are still cited over 30 years later.

AGU SESSION P018 - MERCURY AFTER TWO YEARS OF MESSENGER ORBITAL 
OBSERVATIONS

Second Notice

Please consider submitting an abstract to the special session on 
Mercury at the 2013 AGU Fall Meeting in San Francisco, CA, 
December 9-13, 2013.

After two full years of orbital observations of Mercury, NASA's 
MESSENGER spacecraft began its Second Extended Mission in March. The 
Second Extended Mission is addressing Mercury's surprising volatile 
inventory, exploring newly revealed aspects of the planet's geological 
evolution, and witnessing the dynamic response of Mercury's exosphere 
and magnetosphere to the peak and early waning phases of solar 
activity. This session will highlight the latest results on Mercury 
from MESSENGER orbital observations and welcomes contributed papers on 
future mission opportunities, complementary ground-based observations, 
laboratory measurements, and theoretical developments relevant to 
planetary processes at Mercury.

Suzanne Imber (University of Leicester)
Sebastiano Padovan (UCLA)

Conveners:

SESSION P025 - SATURN'S NORTHERN SPRING, FROM STORMS TO POLAR VORTICES

Conveners: Brigette Hesman, Kunio Sayanagi, Scott Edgington, and Kevin
Baines

AGU session, Abstracts due August 6th.

This session solicits presentations on new Cassini, Hubble, and
ground-based observations and the subsequent analyses of Saturn's
atmosphere. The session will focus in particular on 1) the analysis of
the great storm of 2010-2011 and its aftermath; and 2) new observation
of Saturn's north pole, which is in sunlight for the first time since
Cassini's arrival at Saturn.

AGU SESSION P029 - THE SCIENCE OF EXPLORATION AS ENABLED BY THE MOON, 
NEAS AND THE MOONS OF MARS

Building upon the success of the NASA Lunar Science Institute (NLSI), 
the new Solar System Exploration Research Virtual Institute (SSERVI) 
will focus on the scientific aspects of exploration as they pertain to 
the Moon, Near Earth Asteroids (NEAs) and the moons of Mars. This 
session will feature interdisciplinary, exploration-related science 
centered around all airless bodies targeted as potential human 
destinations. Areas of study reported here will represent the broad 
spectrum of lunar, NEA, and Martian moon sciences encompassing 
investigations of the surface, interior, exosphere, and near-space 
environments as well as science uniquely enabled from these bodies.

Please join the SSERVI planetary and exploration science community by 
submitting an abstract to this AGU session.  

Abstract deadline: August 6th

AGU SESSION P030 - THERMAL MODELING OF TERRESTRIAL AND PLANETARY BODIES

Second Notice.

We are inviting you to submit an abstract to the above fall AGU 
session. We are excited to be convening this session, as it gives us 
an opportunity to share our science results and techniques with the 
broad thermal modeling community, rather than just our narrow 
sub-discipline. Our hope is that this session will foster 
communication and facilitate collaborations between sub-disciplines or 
those working on different planetary bodies.  

Thermal modeling techniques are used to understand a broad range of 
geologic and atmospheric problems on solid planetary bodies, including 
but not limited to Earth, Europa, Io, Mars, and Titan. Examples of such 
problems include the cooling of lava flows, volcano/geothermal 
monitoring, surface and near sub-surface physical properties, crater 
deformation, and ice-rock interactions. The techniques used to address 
thermal modeling-related questions are often applicable across many 
disciplines, datasets, and topics. By sharing scientific results 
and/or thermal modeling techniques and applications from a broad range 
of sub-disciplines, we will foster interdisciplinary collaboration and 
cooperation within the diverse thermal modeling community.

Abstract Deadline:  6 August 2013

AGU SESSION V032 - PATTERN TO PROCESS

We would like to draw your attention to an exciting session at the 
upcoming AGU meeting: V032 - Pattern to Process: Remotely sensed 
observations of volcanic deposits and their implications for volcanic 
and surface processes on the terrestrial planets.

Volcanic deposit characteristics observed in remotely sensed data are 
vital to our understanding of the development and evolution of 
planetary surfaces. Terrestrial analogs and remote observations 
provide the fiduciary data but limitations persist. For instance, 
reliable differentiation of lava flows from pyroclastic deposits in 
remote sensing data remains a challenge. Fundamental questions include: 
What are diagnostic features of lava flows and pyroclastic deposits? 
From these, what process and environmental insights can be gained? What 
other deposits can be easily confused with volcanic deposits? We 
propose a session that will address these questions and foster 
collaborations across volcanology, planetary geology, surface 
processes, and geomorphology.

Invited talks will be given by Ian Skilling and John Bailey.

Please consider contributing to this session. The abstract deadline 
August 6th!

AGU SESSIONS P010 COMET ISON EARLY RESULTS AND SESSION P023 ROSETTA,
COMETS AND ORIGINS OF THE SOLAR SYSTEM

We would like to invite the community to submit an abstract to one of 
two cometary science sessions at the AGU Fall Meeting: Session P010 
Comet ISON Early Results and Session P023 Rosetta, Comets and Origins 
of the Solar System. Spectacular comet ISON is on its way through the 
inner solar system, comet PANSTARRS passed by early in the year. And 
next year, 2014, the Rosetta mission will arrive at its target, comet 
67/P Churyumov-Gerasimenko. Among the Rosetta mission goals is an 
increased understanding of the origins of the solar system. 
Contributions to our understanding of origins come from many 
directions, including but not limited to: meteorites, laboratory 
studies, modeling of collapsing discs. These sessions are open to 
papers on ISON first results, solar system origins, comet contributions 
to our understanding, laboratory and meteorite studies related to the 
topic. Session P023 is also open to contributions relevant to the 
Rosetta mission, including thermophysical modeling of the nucleus, 
radiative transfer, inverse modeling and other theoretical and 
laboratory results.

GSA 2013 OUTER SOLAR SYSTEM SATELLITES COMPANION SESSIONS

We call to your attention two companion planetary science sessions at 
the annual Geological Society of America meeting held Oct 27-30 in 
Denver, CO focusing on studies related to the outer solar system 
satellites.

T9: "Outer Satellite Exploration: The Next 50 Years". This session will 
discuss current paradigms and unanswered fundamental questions about 
outer planet satellites that will be important considerations in future 
outer solar system exploration, and mission and instrument concepts 
that address them.

T12: "Voyager to New Horizons: Exploring Surface and Interior Processes 
of Icy Worlds". This session will highlight surface and tectonic 
processes, interiors, and the thermal evolution of icy satellites, 
KBOs, and planetary analogs. We encourage experimental and theoretical 
modeling studies, as well as observational approaches to address 
current scientific objectives.

Additional information about the GSA meeting can be found at:
