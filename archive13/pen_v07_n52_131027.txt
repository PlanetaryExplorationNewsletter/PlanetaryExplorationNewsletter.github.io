[NASA] MARS 2020 DUE DATES AMENDED

The Mars 2020 Investigations AO solicits flight investigations for 
which each Principal Investigator is responsible for a complete space 
flight investigation, including instrument hardware, mission 
operations, and data analysis. Investigations comprised of individual 
instruments or multiple instruments (suites) may respond to the overall 
Mars 2020 objectives to explore and quantitatively assess Mars as a 
potential habitat for life, to search for signs of past life, to 
collect carefully selected samples for possible future return to Earth, 
and to prepare for future human exploration of Mars.

This amendment changes the date for the Pre-Proposal Conference (PPC) 
to October 28, 2013, the due date for required Notices of Intent 
(NOIs) to November 4, 2013, the due date for proposals to January 15, 
2014, the due date for letters of commitment to January 15, 2014, the 
deadline for receipt of proposals on CD-ROM to January 21, 2014, the 
target date for selection announcements to April 2014 and the target 
date for instrument Phase A contracts to May 2014.

NASA POSTDOCTORAL FELLOWSHIPS
 
The NASA Postdoctoral Program (NPP) provides opportunities for 
scientists and engineers to conduct research largely of their own 
choosing, yet compatible with the research opportunities posted on the 
NPP Web site.
 
Selected by a competitive peer-review process, NPP Fellows complete 
one- to three-year Fellowship appointments that advance NASA's 
missions in earth science, heliophysics, planetary science, 
astrophysics, space bioscience, aeronautics and engineering, human 
exploration and space operations, and astrobiology.
 
An example of one of the research opportunities in planetary science 
is:
 
https://www3.orau.gov/NPDoc/Catalog/17688  
 
Applicants must have a Ph.D. or equivalent degree in hand before 
beginning the fellowship, but may apply while completing the degree 
requirements. U. S. citizens, Lawful Permanent Residents, and foreign 
nationals eligible for J-1 status as a Research Scholar may apply.
 
Stipends start at $53,500 per year, with supplements for high cost-
of-living areas and for certain academic specialties. Financial 
assistance is available for relocation and health insurance, and 
$8,000 per year is provided for professional travel.

Applications are accepted three times each year: March 1, July 1, and 
November 1.  However, because many of the NPP advisors were not 
available during the government shutdown, the next application 
deadline has been extended to Friday, November 15, 2013.

THERE'S NO SHUTTING DOWN THE ASTROBIOLOGY STRATEGY PROCESS!

Betcha didn't know that the unofficial motto of NASA's Astrobiology 
Program was "Neither snow nor rain nor heat nor gloom of Congressional 
paralysis stays these scientists from the swift completion of their 
appointed webinars" ;-)

Although NASA was shutdown, the Astrobiology Strategy webinars 
continued through the great work of Andy Burnett and the folks at
KnowInnovation! Thanks so much for keeping us from losing too much 
momentum.

The webinars that occurred during the shutdown were recorded and we 
encourage you to view them via:

http://astrobiologyfuture.org

The schedule of up-coming webinars is also posted there.

We realize that other civil servants may not have been able to 
participate and that the altered scheduled and format may have 
excluded others. However, the webinars are only intended as a kick-off 
to open discussion on a concept paper and to give the community a sense 
of the thought processes that led to the current form of the document.  
For those of you that missed the webinars it's not too late to add your 
voice to our conversation about the future directions of astrobiology 
research. We encourage everyone to review the concept documents, 
comment on them, and participate in the discussion about them. 

Once again, thanks to KnowInnovation and all the webinar attendees 
and participants who kept the astrobiology fires burning while we 
civil servants were restrained from working. Onward!

WORKSHOP ON THE HABITABILITY OF ICY WORLDS

February 5–7, 2014, Pasadena, Calif

http://www.hou.usra.edu/meetings/icyworlds2014

The primary objective of this workshop will be to focus on the 
astrobiological potential of icy worlds in the outer solar system–
including Europa, Ganymede, Enceladus, Titan and beyond–with discussion 
on future research directions and spacecraft missions that can best 
assess that potential. The agenda for the workshop will be organized 
around thematic sessions that address the potential habitability of the 
unique planetary environments of the outer solar system. Presentations 
on research involving terrestrial analogs for icy world environments 
are also encouraged. The workshop will be divided into thematic 
sessions on: water and exotic solvents; chemical energy for life; 
organics and their detection; ocean physics and chemistry; icy world 
activity and habitability over time; continuing and future outer solar 
system exploration.

Abstract Deadline:  November 21, 2013.

COMET ISON OBSERVING CAMPAIGN

Dear Comet Community,

Comet C/2012 S1 (ISON) is upon us and the Comet ISON Observing
Campaign is here to help.  To that end, we are collecting observing
plans, observing logs, and links to refereed papers (URLS below).  
Visit our observation calendar and table (first URL below) to find who 
else is observing the comet, and how your own observations fit into the 
larger campaign. Submit your own observation plans or a summary of 
executed observations to help facilitate important cross-team 
connections. After observing comet ISON, please send the committee a 
brief summary of your experience to help other observers obtain data 
during this rapidly evolving perihelion passage (second URL).  Finally, 
papers concerning comet ISON accepted for publication in peer-reviewed 
journals, or notes published in IAU Circulars and CBATs are welcome to 
be listed on our ISON publication page (final URL).

Good luck observing comet ISON!
Mike Kelley for the Comet ISON Observing Campaign Team

NEW DATES FOR THE ASTEROID INITIATIVE IDEA SYNTHESIS WORKSHOP

Dear Colleague,
 
NASA has selected new dates to resume the Asteroid Initiative Idea 
Synthesis Workshop, which was postponed due to the recent government 
shutdown. We look forward to resuming the workshop and continuing to 
examine the many good ideas that were submitted in response to the 
Asteroid Initiative Request for Information in June.
 
As before, the workshop will be conducted at the Lunar and Planetary 
Institute in Houston. Seating capacity is limited, so the invitation 
list to attend onsite will remain restricted. Virtual participation 
options will again be available, and we will provide those options on 
the workshop web page as the event nears:

http://www.nasa.gov/asteroidworkshop
 
Invitations to the same invited RFI responders and presenters will be 
issued starting Monday, Oct. 28.
 
The new workshop dates are November 20-22, 2013. The program can be 
found on the web site.
