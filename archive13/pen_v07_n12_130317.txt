LPSC TRAVEL CONFUSION UNDER THE SEQUESTER

James L. Green, Director, Planetary Science Division, NASA HQ

Recent guidance has come from the Administration that needs 
interpretation relative to supporting travel for all NASA activities. 
These rules will go into effect on March 19, 2013. We are in the 
process of executing all elements of the guidance and will notify 
those that are affected. For instance, we have worked with all the 
NASA Centers and JPL employees and have completed an approved list 
of attendees. We are working on other clarifications that will be 
issued as soon as possible. If you have any questions about whether 
this applies to you or not and have not received work from NASA please 
assume that you have permission to attend the meeting.

To be perfectly clear, all those traveling to the Lunar and Planetary
Science Conference this week using funding on a NASA GRANT please go to
the meeting. You are exempt for now from these restrictions.
