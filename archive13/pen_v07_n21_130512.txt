JPL ISSUES RFP FOR INSIGHT SURFACE AND ATMOSPHERE CHARACTERIZATION

Colleagues:
 
The Jet Propulsion Laboratory has issued a Request for Proposals (RFP) 
for landing site surface and atmosphere characterization for the 
InSight mission to Mars. The RFP can be accessed at:

SECOND ANNOUNCEMENT: PLANET MARS 4

Les Houches, 20-25 October 2013

On behalf of the organizing committee, it is my pleasure to release 
the second announcement and welcome you all in joining us at the 4th 
workshop "Planet Mars", to be held in les Houches (France), on 20-25 
October 2013. The goals of the workshop are to integrate the main 
results of both the recent Earth-based observations and the missions 
to Mars into a new global picture of Mars evolution. With the same 
spirit of the previous workshops, discussions among scientists of 
different disciplines will be encouraged and it is foreseen that they 
will help refine the scientific goals of the future missions to Mars.

ORIGINS OF LIFE POSTDOCTORAL FELLOWSHIP

The Simons Foundation, a private nonprofit based in New York City, has 
established the Simons Collaboration on the Origins of Life. This 
collaboration will support research on topics such as the astrophysical 
and planetary context of the origins of life, the development of 
prebiotic chemistry, the assembly of the first cells, the advent of 
Darwinian evolution, and the earliest signs of life on the young Earth.

The collaboration invites applications for Postdoctoral Fellowships to 
support independent research on the origins of life at laboratories or 
research institutions in any country.

For more information about the institution, see:

IPEWG 2013: REGISTRATION DEADLINE POSTPONED

Dear Colleagues:

The deadline for registration to the third Meeting of the International 
Primitive Body Exploration Working Group (IPEWG 2013) on May 29-31, 
2013, in Nice, France, has been moved from May 10th to May 17th, 2013 
(12:00 East US time). Information regarding how to register, the 
program (based on solicited speakers only), the meeting goals, the 
logistics are indicated on the following web site (click on the 
Registration Menu for explanations on how to register):

http://www.oca.eu/michel/IPEWG2013/

Discussions held at IPEWG 2013 are expected to impact and improve 
international collaboration activities for primitive body space 
exploration. We hope you will be interested in participating to this 
workshop and to the discussions that will encourage efficient 
international coordinations and efforts to improve our knowledge of 
these fascinating primitive bodies. 

We encourage interested persons to register (and book their Hotel; see 
the web site for information) as soon as possible as the workshop is 
limited to a maximum of 100 participants. Please contact Patrick 
Michel, LOC Chair (michelp@oca.eu) with any questions.

We look forward to welcoming you on the "Nice" CÃ´te d'Azur!

Sincerely,

PIERAZZO INTERNATIONAL STUDENT TRAVEL AWARD

The Planetary Science Institute is pleased to announce an annual award 
to support and encourage graduate students in building international 
collaborations and relationships in planetary science. The Pierazzo 
International Student Travel Award is established in memory of PSI 
Senior Scientist Betty Pierazzo, an expert in the area of impact 
modeling and the astrobiological and environmental effects of impacts 
on Earth and Mars. Betty was also passionate about education, teaching 
and public outreach, and believed in the strength of broad 
collaborations. This award memorializes the scope of how she lived her 
life and the good she sought to bring to our profession and 
communities.

Two awards will be made each year to graduate students working on their 
PhDs, contingent upon there being meritorious applications. One will 
be for a student at a U.S. institution to support travel to a 
planetary science related meeting outside of the U.S. The second will 
be to a student at an institution outside of the U.S. for a meeting 
within the U.S. Any area of planetary science is acceptable.

Each award will consist of a certificate and up to $2,000.
