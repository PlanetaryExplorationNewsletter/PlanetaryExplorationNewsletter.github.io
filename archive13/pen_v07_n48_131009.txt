NASA CORRECTION - PMDAP DUE DATE NOT DEFINED

In the previous announcement from NASA, it was stated that "When the 
government resumes business, proposals [to the Planetary Mission Data 
Analysis Program (PMDAP)] will be due three working days after the 
shutdown ends."

This continues to be correct for the Mars Data Analysis Program (MDAP), 
but it was applied to PMDAP in error.

The PMDAP deadline will be set at a reasonable time once government 
operations resume.

[Note from the Editors: During the US government shutdown, we have
offered the services of PEN to facilitate the communication of 
information pertaining to NASA planetary programs.]
