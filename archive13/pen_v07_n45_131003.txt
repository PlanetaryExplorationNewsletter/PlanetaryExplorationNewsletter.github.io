MDAP DUE DATE DELAYED, NOW TBD

Notice on NSPIRES:

"Amended October 3, 2013. The proposal due date for this program, 
Appendix C.12, the Mars Data Analysis Program, has been delayed from 
October 4, 2013 because of the Government shutdown. The proposal due 
date in tables two and three has been changed to TBD. When the 
Government resumes business, the tables will be updated to indicate 
that proposals will be due three working days after the shutdown ends. 
During the Government shutdown NASA personnel will not be available to 
answer questions, but the NSPIRES help line will be open."
