[NASA] KEPLER GO 6 CANCELATION

ROSES-13 Amendment 29: Appendix D.7, the Kepler Guest Observer 
program, is being removed from ROSES 2013

Between July 2012 and May 2013 the Kepler spacecraft lost two of its 
four reaction wheels that keep the telescope in fine point during 
weeks to months long observations, thus it can no longer deliver the 
high precision photometry necessary for small exoplanet detection. 
Ideas have been solicited for two-wheel science, but any future 
Kepler Guest Observer (GO) solicitation must be very different from 
that released when the spacecraft was operating with a complete set 
of reaction wheels. The time frame for implementing a two-wheel GO 
solicitation more naturally places it in the ROSES 2014 NRA. As a 
result, the Kepler Guest Observer program is being removed from 
ROSES 2013 but it may return in ROSES 2014, depending on the outcome 
of the 2014 Senior Review and the availability of funds.

Questions concerning this amendment and Appendix D.7, the Kepler 
Guest Observer program, may be directed to:

INTERNATIONAL COMETARY WORKSHOP RESCHEDULED FOR APRIL 1-3, 2014

The International Cometary Workshop, originally scheduled for July 
2013 was postponed due to the US Budget sequester and the NASA travel 
restrictions that were imposed in response to the sequester. We are 
pleased to announce that we have rescheduled the Workshop for April 
1-3, 2014. It will take in Toulouse France, and the updated abstract 
deadline is January 31, 2014. The new registration deadline is 
February 28, 2014. Pre-registration is now available. For more 
information see our website at:

ANNUAL CALL FOR NOMINATIONS FOR NASA SCIENCE ADVISORY SUBCOMMITTEES

NASA invites nominations for service on NASA science advisory 
subcommittees of the NASA Advisory Council. U.S. citizens may nominate 
individuals and also submit self-nominations for consideration 
as potential members of NASA's science advisory subcommittees. 
NASA's science advisory subcommittees have member vacancies from 
time to time throughout the year, and NASA will consider nominations 
and self-nominations to fill such intermittent vacancies. NASA is 
committed to selecting members to serve on its science advisory 
subcommittees based on their individual expertise, knowledge, 
experience, and current/past contributions to the relevant subject 
area.

These are not full-time positions. Successful nominees will be required 
to attend meetings of the subcommittee approximately two or three times 
a year, either in person (NASA covers travel-related expenses for this 
non-compensated appointment) or via telecom and/or virtual meeting 
medium. 

DATES: The deadline for NASA receipt of all public nominations is 
November 22, 2013.

FOR FURTHER INFORMATION: To obtain further information on NASA's 
science advisory subcommittees, please visit the NAC Science 
Committee's subcommittee Web site at:

NASA POSTDOCTORAL FELLOWSHIPS

The NASA Postdoctoral Program (NPP) provides opportunities for 
scientists and engineers to conduct research largely of their own 
choosing, yet compatible with the research opportunities posted on 
the NPP Web site.

Selected by a competitive peer-review process, NPP Fellows complete 
one- to three-year Fellowship appointments that advance NASA's 
missions.
 
For a sample opportunity in planetary science see:

https://www3.orau.gov/NPDoc/Catalog/18610    

Applicants must have a Ph.D. or equivalent degree in hand before 
beginning the fellowship, but may apply while completing the degree 
requirements. U.S. citizens, Lawful Permanent Residents, and foreign 
nationals eligible for J-1 status as a Research Scholar may apply.

Stipends start at $53,500 per year, with supplements for high cost-
of-living areas and for certain academic specialties. Financial 
assistance is available for relocation and health insurance, and 
$8,000 per year is provided for professional travel.

Applications are accepted three times each year: March 1, July 1, 
and November 1. However, because many of the NPP advisors were not 
available during the government shutdown, the next application 
deadline has been extended to Friday, November 15, 2013.

BOOK - ASTEROIDS IV: FINAL LIST OF CHAPTERS

We are pleased to announce the final list of chapters and lead authors 
defined for the book ASTEROIDS IV, a new volume in the Space Science 
Series. We want to thank the community for its enthusiastic response 
to the call for chapters, resulting in the submission of over 150 
proposals. Given that we are limited to only about 40 chapters, the 
editors and scientific organizing committee were faced with the 
challenge of defining a broad set of topics that most represents 
the advances of the past decade. For a list of chapters see:

http://www.oca.eu/michel/ASTEROIDSIV/AsteroidsIV_Chapters/
AsteroidsIV_Chapters.html

The community has grown significantly over the past decade and we 
regret that a larger portion cannot directly participate in 
the writing. Advances each of you have made will be included. 
Some will be solicited as chapter referees later on in the process. 
We thank the whole community for your input and support, as 
well as the SOC, for helping to define a great chapter set. We thank 
the lead authors and their co-authors for their expected efforts to 
write chapters that will serve as references for at least the next 
decade.

On behalf of ASTEROIDS IV Editors
(P. Michel, F. DeMeo, W.F. Bottke)

INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE "COSMIC DUST VII"

August 4 - 8, 2014

Umeda Satellite Campus of Osaka Sangyo University, Osaka, JAPAN

This series of Cosmic Dust meetings aims finding a consensus among 
experts on the formation and evolution of cosmic dust: where it comes 
from and where it goes. The primary objectives are to bring together 
professionals who deal with cosmic dust and to provide an opportunity 
for participants to develop human relations and interactions. The 
meeting considers all kinds of cosmic dust: intergalactic, 
interstellar, protoplanetary, debris disk, cometary, interplanetary 
and circumplanetary dust, planetary aerosols, regolith, 
micrometeorites, meteors and meteoroids, presolar grains and stellar 
nebular condensates. The meeting is open for any aspects of dust 
research by means of in-situ and laboratory measurements, astronomical 
observations, laboratory and numerical analogue simulations, 
theoretical modeling, data analysis, etc. Any dust-related topics, 
(e.g., formation of molecules and their reactions on and desorption 
from the surface of dust particles) are also welcome. Publishing the 
proceedings of this meeting will be as a special issue of a peer-
reviewed journal.

Deadline for Admissions Application is May 13, 2014

Earth and Beyond - at the AGU Fall Meeting in San Francisco!

FameLab is fun-filled day of competition, coaching, and camaraderie 
that's all about communicating! It's something like American Idol for 
scientists - you give a 3-minute powerpoint-free talk to a panel of 
judges, but they only give constructive feedback. There's a 
communication training workshop, too, so everyone wins.

Join us on Sunday, December 8th from ~9am-5pm to hone your skills, 
interact with like-minded scientists, and learn from communication 
specialists.

Space is limited, so sign up today at: 

http://famelab-eeb.arc.nasa.gov/competitions/2013-agu-december/ 

Video clips of prior FameLabbers are here: 

http://famelab-eeb.arc.nasa.gov/competitions/ 

There is no cost for any of the FameLab events, and you do NOT need 
to be registered for AGU to participate.
