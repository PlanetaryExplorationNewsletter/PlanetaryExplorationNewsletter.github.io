AGU SESSION GP015 - PLANETARY MAGNETISM AND PALEOMAGNETISM 

Dear Colleagues, 

We invite contributions for this session at the AGU Fall meeting, 9-13 
December 2013, in San Francisco, USA.

Section/Focus Group: Geomagnetism and Paleomagnetism (GP)
Co-Sponsors: Planetary Sciences (P)
 
New paleomagnetic analyses of planetary samples and in situ measure-
ments of planetary magnetism are transforming our understanding of the 
interior structures and thermal evolution of solar system bodies. At 
least seven bodies in the solar system have active dynamos, while 
Mars, the Moon, and some planetesimals likely generated ancient dynamo 
magnetic fields. Some meteorites may record early fields associated 
with the protoplanetary disk or Sun. This session calls for 
contributions relating to three aspects of magnetism on terrestrial 
and giant planets and icy moons: 1) Paleomagnetic studies of samples; 
2) Measurements and modeling of active and past dynamo fields and 
crustal magnetism; and 3) Magnetic properties of extraterrestrial 
materials

AGU SESSION MR019 - VOLATILES AT HIGH PRESSURE: EXPLORING THE 
INTERIOR OF GIANT PLANETS AND EXOPLANETS

Experimental and computational high-pressure techniques are used to 
explore the properties of fluids and solids of simple molecular 
materials and their mixtures at extreme conditions existent inside 
giant planets. We welcome studies about, but not limited to mixtures 
of ices like H2, He, CH4, H2O, NH3, etc. Most of the previous work 
investigated behavior of individual components, but properties of the 
mixtures, including chemical reactions and ionization remain poorly 
understood. Here we invite for dialogue contributors from communities 
of static and dynamic high-pressure, theory and computer simulations, 
planetology, and fluid dynamics, with an interest in the structure 
and functioning of the giant planets. We are especially interested in 
reports on recent advances in understanding hydrogen at megabar 
pressures.

AGU SESSION NH023 - THE CHELYABINSK METEOR EVENT

On February 15, 2013, Earth experienced the largest cosmic impact of 
the last century. Without warning, a ~20-m diameter asteroid plunged 
into the atmosphere and exploded over Cheyabinsk, Russia, with an 
energy of ~0.5 megatons. This session will bring together various 
analyses of this unique event, discuss the nature of the impactor and 
the physics of the airburst, and describe the damage on the ground and 
the meteorites that have been collected. This impact can be understood 
within the context of the broader asteroid impact hazard. It also has 
a human dimension, with important lessons for risk analyses and hazard 
communication. We solicit abstracts from experts on asteroids, impact 
airbursts, meteoritics, risk communication, and natural disaster 
response.

Abstracts are due August 6

AGU SESSION P006 - DYNAMIC MARS FROM LONG-TERM OBSERVATIONS, CORRECTION

(CORRECTED FROM PREVIOUS VERSION)

We are well into the 2nd decade of continuous Mars observations that 
began with MGS and have continued with ODY, MEX, MRO, and our landed 
spacecraft. Bridged to earlier times by spacecraft observations from 
the 1960s onwards, and a continuous telescopic campaign, our view of 
Mars is now one of a planet on which surface and atmospheric changes 
occur at frequencies of days, years, and decades, a testament to long-
term monitoring that continues to this day. At this time, it is 
appropriate that this record, with implications for Martian geology, 
climate, atmospheric dynamics, and other processes, be integrated into 
a journal special section, submitted to Icarus by November 15, 2013.

This special issue is for for papers that: 
- Include surface, sub-surface, and atmosphere observations, or model 
results, that are new and a unique outcome of the long-term data 
acquisition provided by Mars spacecraft and telescopes
- Highlight the long-term implications of processes that are observed 
and ongoing now
- Are not reviews of previous work

AGU SESSION P009 - EVOLUTIONS, INTERACTIONS, AND ORIGINS OF OUTER 
PLANET SATELLITES

Organized by Krishan Khurana & Amanda Hendrix

This session explores current and past planetary processes that lead 
to unique present day conditions on outer planet satellites. The 
session will consist of invited and contributed talks that highlight 
geological and geophysical modeling and interpretation of both 
remotely-sensed and in-situ data. Presentations on interaction of 
planetary field and plasma with the surfaces and interiors of the 
moons and theoretical models of the origin and evolution of surfaces 
and interiors of the moons are also welcome. Contributions that 
investigate processes on multiple moons to uncover underlying trends 
are especially welcome.

AGU SESSION P022 - RAPID ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE AND THE FATE OF PLANETARY 
HABITABILITY

Rapid environmental change can be used as a scientific bridge, relating 
astrobiology to earth, planetary, and space sciences in the study of 
how life may adapt through abrupt climate crises. Recent discoveries 
inspire us to re-examine our understanding of how rapidly planetary 
habitats can be redistributed. Past habitable environments on Mars from 
the Curiosity rover, possible subsurface lakes on Europa, and 
potentially habitable exoplanets from the Kepler spacecraft continue to 
expand our definition of the habitable zone. Abstracts on the 
intertwined aspects of changing habitability, including the complex 
interactions among astronomical, geological, and climatic forces, on 
the Earth and beyond, are welcome.

AGU SESSION P030 - THERMAL MODELING OF TERRESTRIAL AND PLANETARY BODIES

We are inviting you to submit an abstract to the above fall AGU 
session. We are excited to be convening this session, as it gives us 
an opportunity to share our science results and techniques with the 
broad thermal modeling community, rather than just our narrow sub-
discipline. Our hope is that this session will foster communication 
and facilitate collaborations between sub-disciplines or those working 
on different planetary bodies.  

Thermal modeling techniques are used to understand a broad range of 
geologic and atmospheric problems on solid planetary bodies, including 
but not limited to Earth, Europa, Io, Mars, and Titan. Examples of such 
problems include the cooling of lava flows, volcano/geothermal 
monitoring, surface and near sub-surface physical properties, crater 
deformation, and ice-rock interactions. The techniques used to address 
thermal modeling-related questions are often applicable across many 
disciplines, datasets, and topics. By sharing scientific results and/or 
thermal modeling techniques and applications from a broad range of sub-
disciplines, we will foster interdisciplinary collaboration and 
cooperation within the diverse thermal modeling community.

AGU SESSION P034 - USING TOPOGRAPHY TO INVESTIGATE THE EVOLUTION OF 
SOLAR SYSTEM BODIES

Spacecraft data have enabled the surface topography of many solar 
system bodies to be determined. These data provide insight into near-
surface processes and properties that exist over the visible history of 
a body, on global and local scales. We invite abstracts on any topic in 
which topography plays a role. These may describe theoretical 
investigations, laboratory studies or mission data analysis of any body 
in the solar system and could include (but are not limited to): 
topographic measurements that are indicative of the types of surface 
terrain or environments present; processes that create or erase/erode 
surface topography at any scale; and subsurface processes that are 
expressed by surface topography.

GSA SESSION T4 - GEOLOGIC MAPPING OF PLANETARY BODIES ACROSS THE SOLAR 
SYSTEM

Geologic maps present fundamental syntheses of interpretations of the 
materials, landforms, structures, and processes that characterize 
planetary surfaces and can also provide a contextual framework for 
summarizing and evaluating thematic research for a given region or 
body. Planetary geologic maps have been published by the U.S. 
Geological Survey since 1962 and over this time numerous maps of 
several planetary bodies have been prepared at a variety of scales and 
projections using the best available image and topographic bases. These 
maps have been used for scientific analysis of the planetary body, but 
also for specialized investigations such as targeting regions of 
interest for data collection and for characterizing sites for landed 
missions. However, the field of planetary geologic mapping has been 
evolving rapidly to embrace the use of new data and modern technology 
and to accommodate the growing needs of planetary exploration. We 
encourage abstract submissions related to the description of the 
geologic mapping (and subsequent analysis) of solid solar system 
bodies, including the terrestrial planets, moons and asteroids.

GSA SESSION T192 - VOLCANIC/TECTONIC PROCESSES AND THEIR INTERACTIONS 
ON ROCKY PLANETS AND MOONS

We invite submissions to this oral session at the GSA Annual Meeting, 
27-30 October, 2013, in Denver, Colorado (abstract submission 
deadline Aug. 6th). Abstract submission guidelines can be found at: 

http://community.geosociety.org/2013AnnualMeeting/Sessions

The surfaces of the rocky planets and moons have been extensively 
shaped and modified by both tectonic and volcanic processes. In many 
instances, these processes have been comtemporaneous and interactive, 
highlighting the importance of magmatic processes for driving tectonic 
deformation in the absence of plate tectonics. In turn, magmatically 
driven tectonic features provide conduits for the release of magmatic 
fluids, melted cryosphere, and volatiles, particularly on Mars. We 
encourage abstract submissions related to the description, mapping, 
and modeling of volcanic and tectonic features on rocky solar system 
bodies, including terrestrial analogs for planetary processes, with 
emphasis on volcanic/tectonic interaction and its relevance for the 
structural and geomorphological evolution of the rocky planets and 
moons.

4-YEAR PHD POSITION IN EARTH SCIENCES, UTRECHT UNIVERSITY / LEIDEN 
OBSERVATORY, LEIDEN UNIVERSITY

Aqueous alteration of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in asteroids 
and meteorites    

We have an open position for a PhD candidate with a broad interest in 
geosciences, chemistry, and astronomy and a willingness to interact 
across scientific disciplines.

The project focuses on the key question if aqueous alteration could be 
a mechanism to break down larger PAHs into smaller PAHs and other 
organic compounds that are detected in meteorites. The primary goal of 
this proposal is to experimentally investigate the effect of water and 
high temperature on PAHs embedded in meteoritic mineral matrices. Our 
experiments will focus on the interaction between PAHs, water, and 
minerals under different temperature conditions.

We are looking for an enthusiastic person with a background in 
experimental methods relevant to this research; specifically, Raman 
spectroscopy and scanning/transmission electron microscopy techniques. 
While students work on their own PhD projects, good interaction with 
others in the group will be key to success.

RESOURCE - MAP PROJECTION ON THE WEB 

The Astrogeology Science Center is pleased to announce the public 
release of a new community resource called the Map Projection on the 
Web (POW) service. This free, on-line service transforms raw Planetary 
Data System (PDS) images to science-ready map-projected images. POW 
uses PDS Imaging Node tools to locate images and then allows the user 
to select and submit individual images to be processed using 
Astrogeology’s free image processing package, the Integrated 
Software for Imagers and Spectrometers (ISIS). POW provides users with 
calibrated cartographic images that can be used for geologic mapping, 
analysis in a Geographic Image System (GIS), change detection, 
merging of dissimilar instrument images, and use in a host of 
scientific applications (e.g., ArcMAP, ENVI, Matlab, JMARS, QGIS, 
Opticks, etc.). Support for LROC images should be available in late 
August. This project was supported by the NASA PG&G Cartography 
Program.

As a result of the AGU Chapman Conference on "Crossing the Boundaries 
in Planetary Atmospheres: From Earth to Exoplanets," we have launched 
a new website and listserv.  The website includes presentations from 
the conference as well as several new initiatives that have begun in 
response to the group discussions.  We are also investigating the 
possibility of a future journal special issue.  Please check out the 
new website, and join the email list if you would like to receive more 
information in the future:
