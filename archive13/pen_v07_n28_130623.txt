POSTDOCTORAL RESEARCHER IN PLANETARY MAPPING AND IMPACT STUDIES: LUNAR 
AND PLANETARY INSTITUTE

Universities Space Research Association (USRA) invites applications for 
a postdoctoral fellowship in planetary science in Houston, Texas. The 
candidate will work with Dr. Paul Schenk, investigating the impact 
crater shapes and distributions on icy satellites, including Enceladus, 
using the entire Cassini image library, and supplementary stereo and 
shape-from-shading techniques (although experience in these tools is 
not required). The candidate will also be expected to develop their 
own research projects using this data.

Candidate must have a recent Ph.D. in geology or geophysics and have a 
strong background in remote sensing/image processing of spacecraft 
data, and preferably experience in geophysical or mapping 
investigations. The position is generally for two years, with a 
possible extension to three years. Apply to the posting at: 

https://usracareers.silkroad.com/ 

Include a letter of interest, a curriculum vita with a list of 
publications, a brief statement of research interests, and a list of 
three references. Review of candidates begins August 1, 2013, with a 
hiring decision, as soon as possible thereafter. Information on 
current research and facilities at the LPI is found on our website:

48TH ESLAB SYMPOSIUM: NEW INSIGHTS INTO VOLCANISM ACROSS THE SOLAR 
SYSTEM

16-21 June 2014, ESTEC, Noordwijk, Netherlands

Volcanism is a common surface-forming and modifying process and played 
a key role in shaping the early environment of many Solar System 
bodies. Volcanism provides important information about the nature, 
volatile content and state of planetary interiors. Recent results from 
spacecraft observations of the Moon and Mercury have provided new 
insights into the nature and variability of volcanism in the Solar 
System. 

The aim of the 2014 ESLAB symposium is to review the different 
mechanisms, sources and surface expressions of volcanism, both effusive 
and explosive. Special, but not exclusive, emphasis will be put on 
moons and Mercury, target bodies of future ESA missions (BepiColombo 
to Mercury and the Jupiter icy moon explorer mission, JUICE). Other 
themes of the symposium will focus on the understanding of the role and 
impact of volcanism in the early history of terrestrial planets 
(including planet Earth) and possible processes on Mars (studied by 
ESA's ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter). By bringing all this information 
together under this theme, we will be able to improve our current 
understanding of the formation and evolution of our Solar System.

HIGH PRIORITY INVESTIGATIONS FOR VENUS EXPLORATION SPECIAL SESSION AT 
FALL AGU MEETING

2014 will mark 25 years since NASA last launched a mission to Venus. 
The next call for NASA Discovery Mission proposals is quickly 
approaching and Venus is well suited as a target for this class of 
Mission. This special session will frame the current state of Venus 
science in terms of outstanding questions and how they can be addressed 
through future missions. Submissions should summarize new results, the 
state of knowledge, and investigations that address areas such as:
origin and evolution of the Venus interior; surface processes including 
volcanism, tectonics, and impact cratering; and processes governing the 
atmosphereâ€™s thermal structure, composition, and dynamics.
Contributions should address the themes of the Planetary Science 
Decadal Survey.

NASA POSTDOCTORAL FELLOWSHIPS
 
The NASA Postdoctoral Program (NPP) provides opportunities for 
scientists and engineers to conduct research largely of their own 
choosing, yet compatible with the research opportunities posted on the 
NPP Web site. An example of one of the research opportunities in 
planetary science is:
 
https://www3.orau.gov/NPDoc/Catalog/18314
 
Selected by a competitive peer-review process, NPP Fellows complete 
one- to three-year Fellowship appointments that advance NASA's missions 
in earth science, heliophysics, planetary science, astrophysics, space 
bioscience, aeronautics and engineering, human exploration and space
operations, and astrobiology.
 
Applicants must have a Ph.D. or equivalent degree in hand before 
beginning the fellowship, but may apply while completing the degree 
requirements. U. S. citizens, Lawful Permanent Residents, and foreign 
nationals eligible for J-1 status as a Research Scholar may apply.
 
Stipends start at $53,500 per year, with supplements for high cost-of-
living areas and for certain academic specialties. Financial assistance 
is available for relocation and health insurance, and $8,000 per year 
is provided for professional travel.
 
Applications are accepted three times each year: March 1, July 1, and 
November 1.

DRAFT NASA REAUTHORIZATION BILL CANCELS ARM, RESTORES EDUCATION, 
CALLS FOR INCREASED PLANETARY FUNDING

The House Science Committee has released draft legislation to 
reauthorize programs at NASA for two years. It calls for increasing 
the Planetary budget to its FY12 level of $1.5B in FY14 and FY15, bans 
funding development of an asteroid retrieval mission, and orders 
continuation of STEM education and outreach activities within each of 
the NASA directorates. The bill would ban the implementation of 
education reorganization proposed by the President for FY14. The draft 
bill can be accessed at:

AGU FALL MEETING 2013 SPECIAL SESSION P018: MERCURY AFTER TWO YEARS OF 
MESSENGER ORBITAL OBSERVATIONS

We are pleased to announce a special session on Mercury at the 2013 AGU 
Fall Meeting in San Francisco, CA, December 9â€“13, 2013.

After two full years of orbital observations of Mercury, NASA's 
MESSENGER spacecraft began its Second Extended Mission in March. The 
Second Extended Mission is addressing Mercury's surprising volatile 
inventory, exploring newly revealed aspects of the planet's geological 
evolution, and witnessing the dynamic response of Mercury's exosphere 
and magnetosphere to the peak and early waning phases of solar 
activity. This session will highlight the latest results on Mercury 
from MESSENGER orbital observations and welcomes contributed papers on 
future mission opportunities, complementary ground-based observations,
laboratory measurements, and theoretical developments relevant to 
planetary processes at Mercury.

Please consider submitting an abstract for this session. For more 
information, visit:

The submission deadline is August 6, 2013.

Conveners:
Paul Byrne (Carnegie Institution of Washington)
Sean Solomon (Columbia University)
Larry Nittler (Carnegie Institution of Washington)

We look forward to seeing you in San Francisco.

astronomy, physics, or related fields).

The initial appointment is for one year, but the appointment is 
renewable for an additional year.  Review of applications will begin 
July 1, 2013, and the position will remain open until filled. The 
expected start date is October 1, 2013.

Applicants should submit (electronic submission is preferred) resume, 
statement of research experience and interests, and letters of 
recommendation from three references to Prof. Joshua Emery
