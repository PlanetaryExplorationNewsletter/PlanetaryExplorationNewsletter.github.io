This follow-up to the highly successful Target NEO Workshop, held in 
February 2011, supports the development of a robust human exploration 
program by ensuring that the technical viewpoints of experts pertinent 
to robotic and human NEO exploration are provided and documented.

Key Questions: What are the technical challenges involved and what new 
capabilities are needed for the newly proposed Asteroid Retrieval 
Mission (ARM)? Are there any alternative approaches? What technical 
information is still needed to support and sustain a robust human 
explortion program to a NEO?

Outcome: Public Report

Session Descriptions:
Update to Flexble Path Architecture (Asteroid First)
The Small (< 10 m) NEA Population

ANNOUNCEMENT OF OPPORTUNITY TO SUBMIT INPUT TO STUDY ON HUMAN 
SPACEFLIGHT

The U.S. National Research Council (NRC) of the National Academies is
currently conducting a congressionally-requested study to examine the 
goals, core capabilities, and direction of human space flight. The 
Committee on Human Spaceflight invites interested individuals and
groups to submit input papers describing their own ideas on the role 
of human spaceflight and their vision for a suggested future. In 
developing their papers, respondents are asked to carefully consider 
the following broad questions.

1. What are the important benefits provided to the United States and 
   other countries by human spaceflight endeavors?
2. What are the greatest challenges to sustaining a U.S. government 
   program in human spaceflight?
3. What are the ramifications and what would the nation and world lose 
   if the United States terminated NASA's human spaceflight program? 

Respondents are asked to describe the reasoning that supports their 
arguments and, to the extent possible, include or cite any evidence 
that supports their views. In considering #1 above, submitters may 
consider private as well as government space programs.

For more information on the committee and the goals of the study, 
please see the statement of task at:

[NASA] DRAFT EARTH VENTURE INSTRUMENT

Release Date: June 4, 2013
Draft AO Prospective Bidders Telecon/WebEx: June 14, 2013
Comments Due: June 28, 2013
Identification Number: NNH13ZDA009J
Notice Type: Presolicitation

The Earth Venture element of the ESSP Program conducts PI-led science 
investigations relevant to SMD's Earth Science research program. 
Earth Venture investigations must address NASA's goals to acquire 
deeper scientific understanding of the components of the Earth system, 
their interactions, and the consequences to life of changes in the 
Earth system. This solicitation calls for proposals for complete PI-led 
spaceflight instrument development. When deployed on a satellite 
selected by NASA, these spaceflight instruments will be used to conduct 
innovative, integrated, hypothesis or scientific question-driven 
investigations addressing pressing Earth system science issues.

NASA will hold an Draft AO Prospective Bidders Telecon/WebEx on Friday, 
June 14, 2013, to provide an overview of the draft EVI-2 Program 
Element Appendix (emphasizing the differences between EVI-2 and the 
prior EVI-1 solicitation) and to address any questions. Information 
about the Workshop will be made available at: 

http://essp.larc.nasa.gov/EVI-2/

COMPARATIVE CLIMATOLOGY SYMPOSIUM (MAY 7) AND VENUS GAME-CHANGING 
TECHNOLOGY FORUM (MAY 8) PRESENTATIONS POSTED 

Comparative Climatology Symposium presentations 

The May 7th, 2013 Comparative Climatology Symposium aim to maintain 
the multidisciplinary dialogue started at the highly informative 
conference on Comparative Climatology of the Terrestrial Planets 
held in June 2012. This symposium highlighted the similarities and 
differences between the environments of the terrestrial planets: 
Venus, Earth, Mars, and Titan. Speakers presented results from the 
2012 CCTP Conference, current Earth climate models, Earth observation, 
past and current Venus missions, observational studies of the 
Terrestrial planets and exoplanets, and the influence of the Sun on 
climate. Presentations (video and PDF) from this Symposium are now 
posted on the VEXAG website:

Venus Game-Changing Technology Forum (May 8th) presentations

Space technology is a vital tool for both scientists and engineers to 
reach some of the most extreme environments in our solar system. 
Exploring Venus with these technologies can answer key questions 
ranging from the history of Venus to the habitability of our universe.    
 
To help us understand these challenges, a Venus Game-Changing 
Technology Forum was held on May 8, 2013. Presentations from that 
Forum are now posted on the VEXAG website, Meetings Archives tab:

NASA POSTDOCTORAL FELLOWSHIPS

The NASA Postdoctoral Program (NPP) provides opportunities to 
scientists and engineers to conduct research largely of their own 
choosing, yet compatible with the research opportunities posted on 
the NPP Web site. An example of one of the research opportunities 
in planetary science is:

https://www3.orau.gov/NPDoc/Catalog/17721

Selected by a competitive peer-review process, NPP Fellows complete 
one- to three-year Fellowship appointments that advance NASA's missions
in earth science, heliophysics, planetary science, astrophysics, space 
bioscience, aeronautics and engineering, human exploration and space 
operations, and astrobiology.

Applicants must have a Ph.D. or equivalent degree in hand before 
beginning the fellowship, but may apply while completing the degree 
requirements. U. S. citizens, Lawful Permanent Residents, and foreign 
nationals eligible for J-1 status as a Research Scholar may apply.

Stipends start at $53,500 per year, with supplements for high cost-
of-living areas and for certain academic specialties. Financial 
assistance is available for relocation and health insurance, and 
$8,000 per year is provided for professional travel.

Applications are accepted three times each year: March 1, July 1, and 
November 1.
