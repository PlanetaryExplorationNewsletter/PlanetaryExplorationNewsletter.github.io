MEPAG COMMUNITY RESPONSES REGARDING R&A REORGANIZATION

At the November 5 telecon of the Planetary Science Subcommittee, 
Jonathan Rall presented plans for a large reorganization of NASA's R&A 
program. His presentation, included in Jim Green's presentation, 
starting with slide 41, is posted at: 

http://www.lpi.usra.edu/pss/nov2013/

Additional discussion occurred at the virtual town hall on December 3. 

MEPAG compiled questions, comments, and concerns from the science 
community and sent a compilation report to the PSS and Jim Green, 
found at: 

http://www.lpi.usra.edu/PSD-RandA/

The MEPAG leadership strongly recommended that the NASA Planetary 
Science Division seek and consider more community input, and provide 
the information needed to answer the many questions raised by the 
community. Most concerns reflected the lack of information regarding 
key aspects of the reorganization, such as mapping of the present 
research areas into the new ones, the fate of theme cross-cutting 
activities, budgets, and the transition plan with its possible impacts 
on the continuity of funding.
 
As we learn more, we will update the MEPAG community. If you have 
further comments or questions on this topic or about the compilation 
report, please direct them to Dr. Serina Diniega, who has been asked 
to collect information on the behalf of MEPAG.

HABITABLE WORLDS ACROSS SPACE AND TIME

First Announcement: The 2014 STScI Spring Symposium
April 28 - May 1, 2014

Abstract submission deadline: February 28, 2014
On-line registration deadline: March 28, 2014

Within a matter of years, humanity will know for the first time the 
frequency of terrestrial planets in orbit around other stars. This 
knowledge will pave the way for joining research from astronomy, Earth 
science, and biology to understand the past, present, and future of the 
Earth within its larger context as one of many habitable worlds. Such 
work seeks to understand the formation and fate of the Earth as well 
as predict where and when different bodies will be suitable for life.

In this four-day symposium, scientists from diverse fields will discuss 
the formation and long-term evolution of terrestrial bodies throughout 
the various phases of stellar and Galactic evolution. This symposium 
will include discussions about sites for Galactic habitability that 
have not yet been given much attention, such as around post-main 
sequence stars. The existence of these overlooked environments may 
provide motivation for novel astronomical observations with existing 
and next generation ground and space-based observatories.

[NASA] NASA ASTROBIOLOGY INSTITUTE (NAI) STEP-2 PROPOSAL DATE CHANGED

The NASA Astrobiology Institute (NAI) Cycle 7 Cooperative Agreement 
Notice (CAN) provides an opportunity for the submission of team-based 
proposals for membership in the NAI. The goal of CAN Cycle 7 is to 
maintain a multidisciplinary institute by selecting focused, 
interdisciplinary teams that complement without replicating the 
strengths of the continuing teams. 

This Amendment to the NAI Cycle 7 CAN is posted on the NASA research 
opportunity homepage at: 

http://nspires.nasaprs.com
 
In order to include the new director of the NAI in the CAN Cycle 7 
process and to make selection with full knowledge of FY14 budgets, 
the Step-2 proposal due date is changed to April 30, 2014. NASA 
expects that decisions for the Step 1 proposals will be made on or 
before Dec 18, 2013. In addition, a number of links to NAI websites
have been corrected. The full text of the CAN is available 
electronically at the link above. 

Questions specifically regarding this solicitation should be directed 
to:

SPECIAL ISSUE OF ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH ON ISRU FIELD CAMPAIGNS

Papers are invited for a special topical issue of Advances in Space 
Research (ASR) entitled "In-Situ Resource Utilization (ISRU) Field 
Campaigns".
  
This special issue is open to all researchers who may have an 
appropriate scientific and/or technical paper related to the main 
questions about the search for, characterization, and use of in situ 
resources in space. This topic is timely and relevant, particularly in 
the context of enabling future sustainable space exploration with 
robots and/or humans. There have been many advances in recent years in 
understanding the possibilities for ISRU (in situ resource utilization) 
and the potential for enabling more capable long-term solar system 
missions. Papers are encouraged related to prospecting for resources, 
the rationale of using ISRU, recent technology advances, 
instrumentation and payloads, and/or concepts of operations in the 
context of ISRU field campaigns.

Papers must be submitted electronically to: 

http://ees.elsevier.com/asr

Authors must select "Special Issue: ISRU Field Campaigns" when they 
reach the "Article Type" step in the submission process. The deadline 
for submissions is 31 January 2014.

Contact Jennifer.Heldmann@nasa.gov for more information.

[NASA] MARS 2020 AO AMENDMENT 3
 
The Mars 2020 Investigations AO solicits flight investigations for 
which each Principal Investigator is responsible for a complete space 
flight investigation, including instrument hardware, mission 
operations, and data analysis. Investigations comprised of individual 
instruments or multiple instruments (suites) may respond to the overall 
Mars 2020 objectives to explore and quantitatively assess Mars as a 
potential habitat for life, to search for signs of past life, to 
collect carefully selected samples for possible future return to Earth, 
and to prepare for future human exploration of Mars.
 
This amendment makes a number of changes, additions, corrections and 
clarifications, which are identified in the Foreword and detailed in 
bold in the text, to the Announcement of Opportunity. The proposal due 
date is unchanged; proposals are due January 15, 2014.
 
This Amendment to the NASA Announcement of Opportunity "Mars 2020 
Investigations" (NNH13ZDA018O) is posted on the NASA research 
opportunity homepage at:

http://solicitation.nasaprs.com/Mars2020

NASA POSTDOCTORAL FELLOWSHIPS
 
The NASA Postdoctoral Program (NPP) provides opportunities for 
scientists and engineers to conduct research largely of their own 
choosing, yet compatible with the research opportunities posted on the 
NPP Web site.
 
Selected by a competitive peer-review process, NPP Fellows complete 
one- to three-year Fellowship appointments that advance NASA’s missions 
in earth science, heliophysics, planetary science, astrophysics, space 
bioscience, aeronautics and engineering, human exploration and space 
operations, and astrobiology.
 
An example of one of the research opportunities in planetary science 
is:
 
https://www3.orau.gov/NPDoc/Catalog/17605       
 
Applicants must have a Ph.D. or equivalent degree in hand before 
beginning the fellowship, but may apply while completing the degree 
requirements. U. S. citizens, Lawful Permanent Residents, and foreign 
nationals eligible for J-1 status as a Research Scholar may apply.
 
Stipends start at $53,500 per year, with supplements for high cost-of-
living areas and for certain academic specialties. Financial assistance 
is available for relocation and health insurance, and $8,000 per year 
is provided for professional travel.

Applications are accepted three times each year: March 1, July 1, and 
November 1.

6TH ALFVEN CONFERENCE ON PLASMA INTERACTION

Plasma interaction with solar system objects: Anticipating Rosetta, 
Maven and Mars Orbiter Mission 

7-11 July 2014
University College London, UK

Main topics: Comets, Mars, Venus, outer planet moons and Earth's moon 
- especially common processes with comets, and reviewing current 
knowledge prior to the arrival of the new missions.

https://www.ucl.ac.uk/mssl/planetary-science/alfven-conference

Meeting theme: Within our solar system, the planets, moons, comets 
and asteroids all have plasma interactions. The interaction depends 
on the nature of the object, particularly the presence of an 
atmosphere and a magnetic field. Even the size of the object matters 
through the finite gyroradius effect and the scale height of cold ions 
of exospheric origin. It also depends on the upstream conditions, 
including position within the solar wind or the presence within a 
planetary magnetosphere. 

This conference will explore our understanding of plasma interactions 
with comets, Mars, Venus, and inner and outer solar system moons. We 
will explore the processes which characterize the interactions such as 
ion pickup and field draping, and their effects such as plasma escape. 
Data from current and recent space missions, modeling and theory are 
all encouraged, as we explore our local part of the 'plasma universe'.
