GSA SESSION T192 - VOLCANIC/TECTONIC PROCESSES AND THEIR INTERACTIONS 
ON ROCKY PLANETS AND MOONS

We invite submissions to this oral session at the GSA Annual Meeting, 
27-30 October, 2013, in Denver, Colorado (abstract submission 
deadline Aug. 6th). Abstract submission guidelines can be found at: 

http://community.geosociety.org/2013AnnualMeeting/Sessions

The surfaces of the rocky planets and moons have been extensively 
shaped and modified by both tectonic and volcanic processes. In many 
instances, these processes have been contemporaneous and interactive, 
highlighting the importance of magmatic processes for driving tectonic 
deformation in the absence of plate tectonics. In turn, magmatically 
driven tectonic features provide conduits for the release of magmatic 
fluids, melted cryosphere, and volatiles, particularly on Mars. We 
encourage abstract submissions related to the description, mapping, 
and modeling of volcanic and tectonic features on rocky solar system 
bodies, including terrestrial analogs for planetary processes, with 
emphasis on volcanic/tectonic interaction and its relevance for the 
structural and geomorphological evolution of the rocky planets and 
moons.

AGU SESSION P005 - DESTINATION: EUROPA

With the flurry of activity surrounding the Europa Clipper mission and 
promising support from Congress and the public, we invite you to 
participate in an exciting session at AGU. We seek to raise the level 
of discussion about Europa, encourage new hypotheses and to integrate 
geology, geophysics and astrobiology to motivate new Europa science 
and get the community excited about future exploration of this 
exciting moon.

Europa is one of the most compelling bodies in the search for life. 
Given growing support for a new Europa mission such as Europa Clipper, 
this session will present perspectives from a wide range of geological, 
geophysical and ultimately astrobiological backgrounds that are 
forward-looking to what questions the next Europa mission could answer. 
We invite presentations that present cross-cutting themes related to 
the physical nature of Europa and its habitability. We encourage 
presenters to utilize new or existing data, compelling terrestrial 
analogs, and theoretical models to advance new hypotheses or revisit 
and refresh the state-of-the-art in Europa science, and address how 
these ideas relate to future Europa exploration.

Abstracts are due August 6.

AGU SESSION P011 - GALE CRATER, MARS: COMPARING GEOCHEMISTRY AND 
GEOMORPHOLOGY FROM REMOTE SENSING, IN SITU MEASUREMENTS, LABORATORY 
DATA, AND TERRESTRIAL ANALOGS

This session will focus on understanding the geologic context of Gale 
crater through remote sensing, in situ measurements, laboratory data, 
and terrestrial analogs with the goal of integrating newly acquired, 
ground-truth discoveries by the Curiosity rover into our current 
understanding of the region. Studies of the regional and local 
stratigraphy, geomorphology, and geochemistry are encouraged. Specific 
terrestrial and/or martian examples include (but are not limited to) 
distal alluvial fan deposits, clay-bearing mineral phases, and rock 
surface alteration as indicators of past depositional environments 
and the presence of water.

AGU SESSION P016 - IMPACT CRATERING: TERRESTRIAL OBSERVATIONS AND 
PLANETARY APPLICATIONS

We invite the community to submit abstracts to this AGU Fall Meeting 
session focusing on impact cratering processes. The effects of impact 
cratering are observed on the surfaces of nearly every terrestrial body 
in the Solar System. This session will highlight field and remote 
sensing studies of impact craters on Earth and how these observations 
help us to understand syn- and post-impact cratering processes on other 
planets. These processes include, but are not limited to: effects of 
target material, ejecta emplacement, impact melt, post-impact 
hydrothermal systems, and astrobiological implications. Recent studies 
of cratering processes on other bodies such as Mercury, Vesta, Moon, 
Venus, and Mars with ties to Earth-based observations are also welcome.

Conveners: Tanya Harrison and Gordon Osinski

AGU SESSION P030 - THERMAL MODELING OF TERRESTRIAL AND PLANETARY BODIES

We are inviting you to submit an abstract to the above fall AGU 
session. We are excited to be convening this session, as it gives us 
an opportunity to share our science results and techniques with the 
broad thermal modeling community, rather than just our narrow 
sub-discipline. Our hope is that this session will foster 
communication and facilitate collaborations between sub-disciplines or 
those working on different planetary bodies.  

Thermal modeling techniques are used to understand a broad range of 
geologic and atmospheric problems on solid planetary bodies, including 
but not limited to Earth, Europa, Io, Mars, and Titan. Examples of such 
problems include the cooling of lava flows, volcano/geothermal 
monitoring, surface and near sub-surface physical properties, crater 
deformation, and ice-rock interactions. The techniques used to address 
thermal modeling-related questions are often applicable across many 
disciplines, datasets, and topics. By sharing scientific results 
and/or thermal modeling techniques and applications from a broad range 
of sub-disciplines, we will foster interdisciplinary collaboration and 
cooperation within the diverse thermal modeling community.

IO WORKSHOP 2013: COORDINATION FOR THE EXCEED MISSION

Saturday 12th October, 2013
Southwest Research Institute, Boulder, CO
 
This 1-day scientific meeting will be held in downtown Boulder after 
DPS Denver to discuss the latest research and developments in Io 
science since the 2012 Io Workshop.
 
The Japanese EUV Sprint-A/EXCEED mission will launch in August 2013 
to observe the Jovian aurora and Io plasma torus for a number of 
months. This workshop will focus on topics which might benefit from 
EXCEED data and coordinated observations at all wavelengths, though 
presentations on other aspects of Io science will be accepted if time 
allows.

PLANETARY SCIENCE SLIDES AND ILLUSTRATIONS

Are you looking for some great slides or illustrations to use in your 
presentations? The Planetary Science Research Discoveries website has 
sets of Powerpoint slides. These are summaries of PSRD articles 
covering the origin of solar systems and the processes by which 
planets, moons, and small bodies form and evolve. The slides are 
annotated with captions and notes, and are linked to PSRD articles 
that provide the full context, additional graphics, and references.

http://www.psrd.hawaii.edu/Archive/Archive-PSRDpresents.html

The Cosmochemistry Illustrated website offers Powerpoint slides with 
planetary examples to enrich any geochemistry, petrology, and 
introductory geology lecture. References and background are given in 
the notes pages.

VENUS EXPRESS VIRTIS AND VMC DATA WORKSHOP

ESA is pleased to announce a Venus Express VIRTIS and VMC Data Workshop 
that will be held at ESAC (Madrid, Spain) on 21-24 October 2013. The 
overall goal of the workshop is to introduce users to the Planetary 
Science Archive (http://archives.esac.esa.int/psa) on which data from 
ESA planetary missions are archived. This workshop will focus on the 
VIRTIS (Visible and Infrared Thermal Imaging Spectrometer) and VMC 
(Venus Monitoring Camera) instruments of the Venus Express orbiter.
 
Scientific and technical lectures will be provided, as well as hands-on 
data processing exercises, with expert members of the VIRTIS and VMC 
instrument teams providing direct support on the best ways in which to 
calibrate and use their data for science.
 
Deadline for registration is August 31st, 2013.

In order to ensure the right level of interaction, participation will 
be restricted to a limited number of participants (20). Preference will 
be given to PhD students and post-docs.
 
No charge is made for participation in the workshop, but no support for 
travel and subsistence costs will be provided by ESA.

choosing, yet compatible with the research opportunities posted on the 
NPP Web site.
 
Selected by a competitive peer-review process, NPP Fellows complete 
one- to three-year Fellowship appointments that advance NASA’s missions 
in earth science, heliophysics, planetary science, astrophysics, space 
bioscience, aeronautics and engineering, human exploration and space 
operations, and astrobiology.
