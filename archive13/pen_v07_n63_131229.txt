APOLLO 8 EARTHRISE VIDEO

Hi all,

I wanted to let you know about a new video NASA has produced, which I 
narrated and helped to develop, re-creating the Apollo 8 Earthrise. 
You can see it here:

I wish you all a good holiday and hope to connect in 2014!

EGU 2014 SESSION: PS2.4 MARS SCIENCE AND EXPLORATION

27 April – 02 May 2014, EGU, Vienna

The Mars Science and Exploration Session will address the latest 
results on the interior, surface, atmosphere and ionosphere of Mars 
from recent and ongoing Mars missions, as well as the future 
exploration of the Red Planet.

In particular, the session is primarily targeted at: (1) presentations 
on scientific investigations as well as theoretical models concerning 
the deep interior and subsurface structure; the surface morphology, 
geology, geochemistry and mineralogy; the atmospheric composition, 
dynamics and climate; the ionospheric environment and its interaction 
with the solar wind; Phobos, water evolution, astrobiology and 
habitability of Mars; (2) discussions on scientific goals, long-term 
plans and proposed experiments for future robotic and human missions 
to Mars, as well as results obtained from ground-based measurements.
For further information, see:

The deadline for abstract submission is: 16 January 2014, 13:00 CET.

We look forward to receiving your contributions.

Please contact us for further information and proposals.

Thank you.

[NASA] ROSES-13 AMENDMENT 41: THE LIVING WITH A STAR (LWS) PROGRAM 
DRAFT

The goal of NASA's Living with a Star (LWS) Program is to develop the 
scientific understanding needed for the United States to effectively 
address those aspects of Heliophysics science that may affect life and 
society. LWS Science solicits proposals for fundamental science that 
will lead to a physics-based understanding of the integral system 
linking the Sun to the Solar System, including the impact on the 
heliosphere, planetary magnetospheres, and ionospheres. The program's 
objectives can be achieved by data analysis, theory, and modeling, 
and the development of tools and methods (e.g., software for data 
handling).
 
This amendment presents to the public draft text for next year's call, 
which will appear in the ROSES-2014 omnibus solicitation when it is 
released in February 2014.
 
Questions concerning this amendment and Appendix B.6, H-LWS, may be 
directed to:

NASA POSTDOCTORAL FELLOWSHIPS
 
The NASA Postdoctoral Program (NPP) provides opportunities for 
scientists and engineers to conduct research largely of their own 
choosing, yet compatible with the research opportunities posted on the 
NPP Web site.
 
Selected by a competitive peer-review process, NPP Fellows complete 
one- to three-year Fellowship appointments that advance NASA’s missions 
in earth science, heliophysics, planetary science, astrophysics, space 
bioscience, aeronautics and engineering, human exploration and space 
operations, and astrobiology.
 
An example of one of the research opportunities in planetary science 
is:
 
https://www3.orau.gov/NPDoc/Catalog/17903          
 
Applicants must have a Ph.D. or equivalent degree in hand before 
beginning the fellowship, but may apply while completing the degree 
requirements. U. S. citizens, Lawful Permanent Residents, and foreign 
nationals eligible for J-1 status as a Research Scholar may apply.
 
Stipends start at $53,500 per year, with supplements for high cost-of-
living areas and for certain academic specialties. Financial 
assistance is available for relocation and health insurance, and 
$8,000 per year is provided for professional travel.

Applications are accepted three times each year: March 1, July 1, and 
November 1.

ESA MARS EXPRESS: CLOSEST-EVER FLYBY OF PHOBOS

Early in the morning (GMT time) on Sunday, 29 December 2013, ESA's 
Mars Express made the closest-ever flyby of Phobos, one of Mars' two 
moons.

STEVE FOSSETT POSTDOCTORAL FELLOWSHIP

The Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences at Washington University 
in Saint Louis invites applications for the Steve Fossett Postdoctoral 
Fellowship.The Department seeks outstanding candidates who will 
strengthen and complement existing areas of study, including both 
terrestrial and planetary geology, geochemistry, geophysics, and 
geobiology.

VOLUNTEER STILL NEEDED FOR LPSC PROGRAM COMMITTEE: AEOLIAN PROCESSES
 
Dear planetary science friends, please share this far and wide. I have 
not yet identified someone to serve on the LPSC program committee to 
handle planetary aeolian processes. I also need to make clear that I'm 
asking for someone to come to Houston to be on the committee; this is 
not something we do by remote access.
 
If you have expertise in planetary aeolian processes and are available 
the week of 13 January, I need your help on the Lunar and Planetary 
Science Conference program committee. It's my last gap to fill and I'd 
really like to get this all sewn up as soon as possible. If you have 
this background and wish to help out, please email me at 
david.draper@nasa.gov. We need just one person for this spot, and the 
only folks who we can't use this year are USGS civil servants, owing 
to vagaries between their accounting procedures and those used to 
fund the program committee (don't ask).
 
Thanks!
 
Dave Draper, LPSC Program Committee Chair
