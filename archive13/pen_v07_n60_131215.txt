DEBUTING THE UPDATED MEPAG WEBPAGE

To Members of the Mars exploration community,

We invite you to visit the updated MEPAG webpage: 

http://mepag.jpl.nasa.gov/

We hope that this redesign makes the site easier to navigate and more 
aesthetically pleasing. In general, content has not been altered 
(just updated), with the exception of the expanded "About Us" section 
which provides more information about the MEPAG Committee members. 
We welcome any comments you have about the structure, content, and 
organization of this site -- you can submit it under the "Contact Us" 
link at the bottom of the webpage.

ANNOUNCING THE COMETARY COMA IMAGE ENHANCEMENT FACILITY

This facility hosted by PSI and available at the URL:

http://www.psi.edu/research/cometimen 

will enable cometary researchers to digitally enhance coma images of 
comets using five different image enhancement techniques that are not 
widely available in the public domain.

Users can upload their images in FITS format and can download the 
enhanced FITS images. Please refer to documentations in the help page 
at the website for details.

LIFE JOURNAL SPECIAL ISSUE - PLANETARY EXPLORATION: HABITATS AND
TERRESTRIAL ANALOGS

Planetary exploration is moving at a fast pace as we learn about 
environmental conditions on various planetary bodies in our solar 
system and beyond. Habitable conditions at some time during the 
history of the solar system have been proposed to have existed on 
Mars, Venus, and a number of icy moons of the outer solar system, 
some of which may still exist today. For this "LIFE" Special Issue,
we particularly encourage submissions describing habitable conditions 
on planetary bodies and of how life could have interacted with them; 
also a description of analog environments on Earth from which we can 
learn about possible adaptations and life strategies on other 
planets and moons.

Manuscripts can be submitted until the deadline (30 May 2014). Papers 
will be published continuously (as soon as accepted) and will be 
listed together on the special issue website. Research articles, 
review articles as well as communications are invited. For planned 
papers, a title and short abstract (about 100 words) can be sent to 
the Editorial Office for announcement on the website.

NASA POSTDOCTORAL FELLOWSHIPS

The NASA Postdoctoral Program (NPP) provides opportunities for 
scientists and engineers to conduct research largely of their own 
choosing, yet compatible with the research opportunities posted on 
the NPP Web site.

Selected by a competitive peer-review process, NPP Fellows complete 
one- to three-year Fellowship appointments that advance NASA's 
missions in earth science, heliophysics, planetary science, 
astrophysics, space bioscience, aeronautics and engineering, human 
exploration and space operations, and astrobiology.

An sample research opportunities in planetary science is:

https://www3.orau.gov/NPDoc/Catalog/17702        

Applicants must have a Ph.D. or equivalent degree in hand before 
beginning the fellowship, but may apply while completing the degree 
requirements. U. S. citizens, Lawful Permanent Residents, and foreign 
nationals eligible for J-1 status as a Research Scholar may apply.
 
Stipends start at $53,500 per year, with supplements for high cost-
of-living areas and for certain academic specialties. Financial 
assistance is available for relocation and health insurance, and 
$8,000 per year is provided for professional travel.

Applications are accepted three times each year: March 1, July 1, and
November 1.

[NASA] THE ASTROPHYSICS RESEARCH AND ANALYSIS PROGRAM

This amendment permits proposals for development of new data analysis 
methods for future space missions to APRA, see Section 1.2.3, and 
also corrects dates for Sounding Rocket launches from Woomera, see 
Section 1.2.1.1. Budget instructions for Co-I proposals are clarified 
in several places. Instructions for the use of the Wallops Arc-second 
Pointing System are clarified, see Section 1.2.1.2. This Amendment 
also removes the portion of this solicitation on Laboratory 
Astrophysics proposals of potentially larger scope that address 
the acquisition of data for understanding the molecular universe at 
infrared and submillimeter wavelengths (see Section 1.2.4). The 
funding level for Laboratory Astrophysics indicated in the table 
in section 2.1 of element D.3 remains unchanged. This amendment 
also changes the point of contact for Infrared, Submillimeter, 
and Radio Astrophysics (see Section 3). New text is in bold and 
deleted text is struck through. The due dates for NOIs and proposals
remain unchanged at January 24, 2014, and March 21, 2014, respectively.

[NASA] THREE-DAY TRAINING COURSE ON PLANETARY PROTECTION

Course: "Planetary Protection: Policies and Practices"
Dates: March 11-13, 2014
Location: Kennedy Space Center, Florida

We cordially invite all interested parties to participate in the 
upcoming course on Planetary Protection Policies and Practices, which 
is designed to familiarize current and future practitioners with NASA, 
ESA, and COSPAR planetary protection programs. The course provides an 
overview of applicable policies, practices and procedures necessary to 
implement a successful planetary protection program, emphasizing 
integration of managerial, administrative, and laboratory activities. 
It is supported by the NASA Planetary Protection Officer.

Enrollment: 14 participants
Application: contact Amy Baker at tasalb@msn.com

INPUT REQUESTED: PLANETARY SCIENCE AND THE HUBBLE SPACE TELESCOPE

Solar System observations have played a major role in HST's science 
program since its launch in 1990, but in recent years the overall 
proposal pressure has declined. After consultation with the Space 
Telescope Users Committee, STScI's Director, Matt Mountain, has 
constituted an advisory committee to examine this issue and provide 
advice on future strategies for planetary science programs with HST. 
The committee is chaired by Prof. Phil Nicholson (Cornell) and the 
committee members are Michele Bannister (U. Victoria), Bonnie Buratti 
(JPL), Marc Buie (SWRI), Jean-Luc Margot (UCLA), Stefanie Milam 
(GSFC) and Glenn Orton (JPL).

The committee is charged with:
* Reviewing the evolution of HST usage by the planetary community;
* Soliciting input on the future role that HST can play in planetary 
  science and on methods for increasing participation by the solar 
  system community; and
* Investigating potential mechanisms for coordinating HST science 
programs with priorities among the planetary community.

We would like to solicit suggestions from the community on ways that 
HST could better support planetary science. Please submit your 
suggestions either in text form or as short white papers to 
hstsolarsys@stsci.edu, or contact any committee member.
