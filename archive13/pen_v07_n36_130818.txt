MICHAEL J. WARGO (1951-2013)

It is with great sadness that we note the unexpected passing of 
Mike Wargo, Chief Exploration Scientist for NASA's Human Exploration 
and Operations Mission Directorate (HEOMD). Mike was a leading 
contributor to NASA's human lunar and planetary exploration program. 
He was involved in many lunar missions, including Lunar Reconnaissance 
Orbiter and the LCROSS satellite. In his nearly two decades at NASA, 
he received numerous awards, including the NASA Exceptional Service 
Medal and seven group achievement awards. He worked tirelessly to 
integrate science community input into human exploration planning as 
the primary interface with NASA's Mars, Lunar, and Small Bodies 
Assessment Groups. His openness, enthusiasm and energy will be sorely 
missed. More extensive memoria may be found at:

/obituary.aspx?pid=166329664#fbLoggedOut

NASA is asking the International Astronomical Union to name a crater on 
the moon in his honor "so his name will be forever enshrined in the 
heavens." Gifts may be made to MIT in memory of Michael Wargo for the 
Department of Materials Science Endowed Fellowship Fund by contacting 
Bonny Kellerman, bonnyk@mit.edu or at 617-253-9722.

MARS CRITICAL DATA PRODUCTS PROGRAM (ROUND VIII) - COMET SIDING SPRING
MODELING
 
The Mars Exploration Program has issued, in August 2013, a Request for 
Proposal (RFP) for round VIII of the Mars Critical Data Products 
program at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory.  This RFP provides support 
of the modeling the dust and particle environment of Comet 2013 A1 
(Siding Spring) during its encounter with Mars in October 2014. The 
intent is to provide data products useful for risk assessment and 
mitigation strategy development for the Mars orbiter missions, due to 
possible impacts from dust and ion tail particles as this comet 
encounters Mars. Proposals are due on Wednesday, September 11, 2013.

Details of the RFPs are posted at: 

https://acquisition.jpl.nasa.gov/RFP/MJ-2692-072413/default.htm

[NASA] ASTROBIOLOGY STRATEGIC PLAN UPDATE

The 2014 Astrobiology Strategic Plan is now under construction. It has 
involved the community in online and face-to-face discussions. 
Twenty-one working documents have been generated that encompassed 
research themes as diverse as:

How did bio-relevant elements evolve into molecules?
How can we best overcome our ignorance about microbial life on Earth?
How would we find and identify an inhabited planet?
How can we enhance the utility of biosignatures as a tool to search for 
life in the Solar System & beyond?

Starting in September, the working documents will be published on the 
astrobiologyfuture.org website and you will be invited to review and 
comment on them. One webinar will be held for each document.

In January-to-February 2014, the authors of the working documents will 
incorporate the community's comments. A face-to-face integration 
workshop will be held in late February to create a first draft of the 
Strategic Plan. A final draft will be published in April 2014.

For a detailed summary of the face-to-face workshop:

https://astrobiology.nasa.gov/roadmap/2014-astrobiology-strategic-plan/

In conclusion, this is your community and NASA wants your input. Be 
part of this exciting process and make your voice heard!

NASA POSTDOCTORAL FELLOWSHIPS

The NASA Postdoctoral Program (NPP) provides opportunities for 
scientists and engineers to conduct research largely of their own 
choosing, yet compatible with the research opportunities posted on the 
NPP Web site.

Selected by a competitive peer-review process, NPP Fellows complete 
one- to three-year Fellowship appointments that advance NASA's missions 
in earth science, heliophysics, planetary science, astrophysics, space 
bioscience, aeronautics and engineering, human exploration and space 
operations, and astrobiology.

An example of one of the research opportunities in planetary science 
is:

https://www3.orau.gov/NPDoc/Catalog/17903

[NASA] LESSONS LEARNED FROM RECENT PLANETARY SCIENCE DIVISION 
ANNOUNCEMENTS OF OPPORTUNITY

The New Frontiers 2009 AO, the Discovery 2010 AO, and the Jupiter Icy 
Moon Explorer (JUICE) Instrument AO contained new features such as 
incentives for the use of specific, NASA-developed technologies, 
extended reserve requirements and concurrent evaluations by 
international partners.

In anticipation of the next AOs for the Discovery and New Frontiers 
Programs, NASA seeks information from the scientific and mission 
management community on perceptions of the distinctive features of the 
three recent AOs. This information may be used as the basis for 
further dialogue via a subsequent, virtual, town-hall style meeting.

Responses are required as PDF documents, not exceeding five pages, 
uploaded through NASA's NSPIRES system. Each response shall address a 
single issue, identified by the respondent, that may be common to all 
of the AOs, some of them, or relevant to only one of them. There is no 
limit on the number of responses that an individual or institution may 
submit.

Responses are due by October 15, 2013. For instructions, go to: 

http://nspires.nasaprs.com

CALL FOR OBSERVATIONS:  EARTH-BASED OBSERVING CAMPAIGN IN SUPPORT OF 
THE NEW HORIZONS MISSION TO PLUTO

The July 2015 New Horizons encounter with Pluto presents a once-in-a
-lifetime opportunity to directly link our Earth-based view of the 
Pluto system with 'ground truth' provided by in situ measurements. 
With the encouragement of Dr. James L. Green, Director of Planetary 
Science, NASA Headquarters, a call for observations is being made in 
support of the New Horizons mission. Observers throughout the 
international community are invited to participate. The goal of the 
observing campaign is to establish an extensive Earth-based 
measurement context for the state of the Pluto system at the time of 
the flyby, including evolving trends in the system for at least one 
year prior- and post-flyby. Further details on the campaign are 
available here:

http://www.boulder.swri.edu/nh-support-obs/

Please register your interest by sending an email to:

nhobs "at" boulder.swri.edu  

In addition, informal workshops (information sessions) are being 
planned during the European Planetary Science Conference (EPSC) in 
London 8-13 September and during the Division for Planetary Sciences 
Meeting (DPS) in Denver 6-11 October. The DPS workshop will be on 
Tuesday, 8 October at 12:00noon-1:00pm in the Plaza Ballroom E at the 
Sheraton Denver Downtown.

NEW PRODUCT:  GLOBES OF THE GALILEAN SATELLITES

Real World Globes, in conjunction with the Ronald Greeley Center for
Planetary Studies (NASA's Regional Planetary Information Facility at
Arizona State University) and the US Geological Survey, have produced
sets of Galilean satellite globes available for purchase.  Using the
combined Galileo-Voyager global mosaics produced by the USGS and
including up-to-date named surface features, Real World Globes has
produced globes of Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto, which are
available for purchase for $150 each (assembled) or $125 each (kits)
for the 10 inch globes, and $288 each (assembled) or $178 each (kits)
for the 18 inch globes.  A 10% discount is offered for purchase of
any combination of 4 globes.  The globes were presented and displayed
at the July 2013 OPAG Meeting in Washington DC, and will be on
display at the Real World Globes booth at the Fall AGU Meeting.
Although the quality of these globes is not as good as the Replogle
globes of the Moon or Mars, they are probably good enough for most
purposes.  For more information, please go to:
