PROPOSAL DUE DATE DELAYED FOR PLANETARY MISSION DATA ANALYSIS PROGRAM

The proposal due date for Planetary Mission Data Analysis (PMDAP) has 
been delayed because of the government shutdown. The proposal due date 
is changed from Friday, Oct. 11, to TBD. 

When the government resumes business, proposals will be due three 
working days after the shutdown ends. 

During the government shutdown NASA personnel will not be available to 
answer questions, but the NSPIRES help line will be open.

When the government resumes business, questions concerning PMDAP may 
be directed to:
