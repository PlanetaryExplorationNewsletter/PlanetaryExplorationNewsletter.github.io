PLANETARY SCIENCE POSITIONS, FLORIDA SPACE INSTITUTE, UNIVERSITY OF
CENTRAL FLORIDA

The Florida Space Institute (http://fsi.ucf.edu/), a multi-disciplinary 
center conducting leading edge applied and basic research and education 
programs in space-related fields ranging from planetary science to 
space physics and Earth science, is now seeking applications for new 
planetary research scientist positions.  
 
UCF and FSI have already recruited planetary scientists, primarily 
working in the areas of small body studies, Mars, and exoplanets 
(see http://planets.ucf.edu/), and we are committed to becoming a 
premier institution in planetary science and education. Of particular 
interest now are Principal Investigators of planetary science research 
grants, centers, and mission experiments. Seeking greater career 
opportunities.
 
Applicants must have a PhD in a planetary science or a relevant field. 
Successful applicants should have demonstrated research leadership 
ability and interpersonal skills, and a consistent record of 
competitively funded space research and/or experimentation grants and 
contracts. 
 
Review of applications will continue through 31 December 2013. 
Applicants should apply on line at: 

http://www.jobswithucf.com 

and click on the 'Search Available Positions' option on the top left. 
Once there, type in position number TBD to search for this position. 
 
The University of Central Florida is an equal opportunity, equal 
access, and affirmative action employer.

AAS SPECIAL SESSION: SPITZER SPACE TELESCOPE, THE NEXT TEN YEARS

There will be a special Spitzer session at the upcoming winter AAS in
Washington D.C.

When: Tuesday, January 7, 2014, 10-11:30 AM
Where: Potomac Ballroom C

As NASA's final Great Observatory enters its second decade of science
observations, this special session will highlight the unique and 
evolving science enabled by Spitzer in the fields of exoplanet 
characterization, stellar variability, and high-redshift galaxies and 
clusters. The speakers will also explore future discoveries made 
possible by operating Spitzer through 2018 and mining the rich public 
archive after the end of operations.

Program:
* Lisa Storrie-Lombardi: Introduction
* Sara Seager: Spitzer's Past and Future Exoplanet Legacy
* Peter Capak: Pushing the Frontiers to z > 10 with the Spitzer Space
  Telescope
* Ann Marie Cody: Spitzer and Variable Young Stars: Shining a Spotlight 
  on Circumstellar Disks
* Casey Papovich: The Spitzer View of Galaxy Clusters in the Distant
  Universe

A NEW WARM SPITZER IRAC IMAGE FEATURES AND CAVEATS WEB PAGE

We have added a new web page at:

http://irsa.ipac.caltech.edu/data/SPITZER/docs/irac/warmfeatures/

which describes the features seen specifically in warm IRAC data. 
Features are illustrated with images, when feasible, and available
mitigation techniques are discussed. We encourage the community to
familiarize themselves with these image features and we would love to 
get feedback about this new page. Please send your comments and 
suggestions to Helpdesk at help@spitzer.caltech.edu.

REGISTER TODAY FOR THE 2014 HUMANS TO MARS SUMMIT

Registration fee increases on January 1, 2014

Join us at the Humans to Mars Summit (H2M). Co-sponsored by Explore 
Mars, the George Washington University, and the Space Policy Institute 
at GW, H2M will be held on April 22-24, 2014 at at George Washington 
University in Washington, DC. H2M will be a comprehensive Mars 
exploration conference to address the major technical, scientific, and 
policy related challenges that need to be overcome to send humans to 
Mars by 2030. Topics will include Mars mission architecture and 
challenges, science goals, planetary protection, International 
cooperation, Mars and STEM education, space and US competitiveness, 
ISRU, and many other topics.

Some of the tentative speakers already include Charles Bolden, 
William Gerstenmaier, James Garvin, Doug McCuistion, Penelope Boston, 
Sam Scimemi, Mike Raftery, Marc Kaufman, Buzz Aldrin, Joel Levine, 
Miles O'Brien, Rebecca Keiser, and many more.
