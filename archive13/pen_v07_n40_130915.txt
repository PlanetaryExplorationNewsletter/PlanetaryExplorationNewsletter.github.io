[NASA] ASTROBIOLOGY STRATEGIC PLAN - IMPORTANT MILESTONE

The NASA Astrobiology Strategy process has reached an important 
milestone. The concept documents, which were created at the face-to-
face Wallops Island workshop, are now ready for public comment.

The commenting process will be kicked-off with a webinar on the 19th of 
September at 14:00 EDT. During the event, Frank Rosenzweig, Eric Smith, 
and Michael New will give an overview of the work done so far, and 
explain the next steps. More details can be found at: 

http://astrobiologyfuture.org 

The kick-off event will be followed by a series of webinars in which 
the authors of each paper will discuss their key ideas and answer 
questions. With a few exceptions for public holidays, these webinars 
will happen on Wednesdays and Thursdays at 14:00 Eastern time. Details 
of each event will be available at the above URL and also via email 
reminders.

Spectrograph (VIRS); and an Energetic Particle and Plasma Spectrometer 
(EPPS).

All data sets in this MESSENGER release can be accessed from:

http://pds.nasa.gov/subscription_service/SS-20130906.html 

To access all data archived in the PDS:

NASA POSTDOCTORAL FELLOWSHIPS

The NASA Postdoctoral Program (NPP) provides opportunities for 
scientists and engineers to conduct research largely of their own 
choosing, yet compatible with the research opportunities posted on the 
NPP Web site.
 
Selected by a competitive peer-review process, NPP Fellows complete 
one- to three-year Fellowship appointments that advance NASA’s missions 
in earth science, heliophysics, planetary science, astrophysics, space 
bioscience, aeronautics and engineering, human exploration and space 
operations, and astrobiology.
 
An example of one of the research opportunities in planetary science 
is:
 
https://www3.orau.gov/NPDoc/Catalog/17710  
 
Applicants must have a Ph.D. or equivalent degree in hand before 
beginning the fellowship, but may apply while completing the degree 
requirements. U. S. citizens, Lawful Permanent Residents, and foreign 
nationals eligible for J-1 status as a Research Scholar may apply.
 
Stipends start at $53,500 per year, with supplements for high cost-of-
living areas and for certain academic specialties. Financial assistance 
is available for relocation and health insurance, and $8,000 per year 
is provided for professional travel.
 
Applications are accepted three times each year: March 1, July 1, and 
November 1.

DEPARTMENT OF GEOLOGY AT THE UNIVERSITY AT BUFFALO - TWO TENURE-TRACK 
FACULTY POSITIONS

Applications are invited for:
Assistant or Associate Professor of Near-Surface Geophysics or 
Hydrogeophysics. We seek a scholar who applies geophysical techniques 
to solve hydrogeologic problems. Researchers interested in developing 
novel approaches to characterize hydrogeologic processes and/or 
properties and/or by combining data from multiple tools are of 
particular interest.

Assistant Professor of Volcanology. Preference given to candidates 
with a background and interest in geophysical approaches to 
understanding and anticipating volcanic eruptions, and associated 
hazard assessment and mitigation strategies.

Successful candidates will: 1) join the department's environmental and 
volcanology groups that maintain interdisciplinary collaborations, and 
may interact with UB's Center for Geohazards Studies; 2) develop and 
maintain extramurally funded research programs; 3) demonstrate 
commitment to teaching and will instruct undergraduate and graduate-
level courses. Service to the discipline, department and/or 
university is expected. A Ph.D. is required at the time of 
appointment.

Applications must be submitted through the UB Jobs website; 
-Near-Surface Geophysics (posting #1300569):

-Volcanology (posting #1300570): 

https://www.ubjobs.buffalo.edu/applicants/Central?quickFind=56487

Application reviews begin on Oct. 1, 2013 and continue until the 
position is filled. Send inquiries to geology@buffalo.edu. The 
University at Buffalo is an Affirmative Action/Equal Opportunity

DPS 2013: STUDENT/POST-DOC RECEPTION

Sun. 6 Oct. 2013, 4:30-6:00pm. DPS meetings are great places for 
students to network among other scientists, to learn about how other 
scientists encounter scientific problems, and get new ideas. However, 
there are so many great presentations, talks, events, and information 
in a short time that the students rarely find time to network among 
other students and get advice close to their own level. This event will 
help students meet other students, in particular those who work on 
similar topics, to discuss their scientific views and general issues, 
and encourages the students to participate in brain storming 
conversations and joint projects. Since the post-docs were graduate 
students not so long ago, their advise and experience is valuable to 
graduate students, and for that reason this event will include post-
docs as well. With these grounds, the goal of the student and post-doc 
reception is to prepare an icebreaker environment for students and 
post-docs to get familiar with each other on the first day of the 
meeting and use the rest of the meeting to enhance those connections 
and get involved with other activities.

DPS 2013: PRO-AM WORKSHOP

Thurs. Oct. 10th at 6:00pm. DPS is experimenting with a professional-
amateur workshop where professionals present what opportunities are 
out there for collaborations with NASA missions and amateurs show 
samples of their observations. Examples: observing Pluto during the 
New Horizons flyby, observing Jupiter's clouds while Juno flies over 
the poles, taking images of comet ISON to find time-variability, 
light-curves of asteroids, follow-up on NEOs, searches for Moon 
impacts (perhaps related to LADEE), Mars observations during MAVEN, 
etc.). Participants wishing to present (5 mins, 5 slides), send title 
& description (<200 words) to frbagenal@gmail.com. 

Organizer: Fran Bagenal, University of Colorado.

CPS Postdoctoral Fellowships in Planetary/Exoplanet Science

The Centre for Planetary Sciences (CPS) at the University of Toronto 
is a centre for the study of all planets, near and far. The CPS 
expects to offer several postdoctoral fellowships of up to three years.
The starting date will be September 1, 2014. Salaries and funds for 
travel/research expenses will be competitive. A Ph.D. in any field of 
earth and planetary sciences or astrophysics is required. Fellows are 
expected to carry out original research in observational or 
theoretical planetary/exoplanet science under the general supervision 
of the permanent CPS-affiliated faculty, from several relevant 
departments at UofT. We only accept electronic submissions (via email 
at kristen.menou@utoronto.ca). Applicants will be asked to submit a 
curriculum vitae, statement of research interests (3 pages) and 
arrange for three letters of recommendation. The deadline for 
applications and all letters of recommendation is December 1, 2013.
The University of Toronto is strongly committed to diversity within 
its community and especially welcomes applications from visible 
minority group members, women, Aboriginal persons, persons with 
disabilities, members of sexual minority groups, and others who may 
contribute to the further diversification of ideas.
