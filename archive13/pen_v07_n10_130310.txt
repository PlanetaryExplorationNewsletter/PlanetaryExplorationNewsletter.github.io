NASA PLANETARY SCIENCE SUMMER SCHOOL APPLICATIONS

NASA is accepting applications from science and engineering post-docs, 
recent PhDs, and doctoral students for its 25th  Annual Planetary 
Science Summer School, which will hold two separate sessions this 
summer (July 29-August 2 and August 12-16) at the Jet Propulsion 
Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif. During the program and pre-session 
webinars, student teams will carry out the equivalent of an early 
mission concept study, prepare a proposal authorization review 
presentation, present it to a review board, and receive feedback. By 
the end of the session, students will have a clearer understanding of 
the life cycle of a space mission; relationships between mission 
design, cost, and schedule; and the tradeoffs necessary to stay within 
cost and schedule while preserving the quality of science. Applications 
are due April 5, 2013. Partial financial support is available for a 
limited number of individuals. Further information is available at:

UPDATING VENUS EXPLORATION GOALS, OBJECTIVES, AND INVESTIGATIONS
 
A primary goal of the Venus Exploration Analysis Group (VEXAG) in 2013 
is to update the Venus Exploration Goals and Objectives Document. A new 
draft of the central table for this document is posted on the VEXAG web 
site at: 

http://www.lpi.usra.edu/vexag/goalsObjectives/

There are two mechanisms for providing feedback on these updated Goals, 
Objectives, and Investigations. The first will be via community 
feedback at the Venus Town Hall meeting at LPSC, Wednesday, 20 March, 
from 12:00 to 13:15 in the Waterways 6-8 Ballrooms.  
 
The second mechanism for providing feedback will be via the VEXAG web 
site (link above). Your comments in the form of text (word or pdf) 
are welcome. The key questions to address are:

1. Are there any major objectives for future exploration that need to 
be added (or subtracted)?
2. Are any measurements and/or measurement techniques that are both 
valuable and currently feasible that are not in the table? If so, 
what change would you make to the table to include that item?
3. What, if any, changes would you suggest regarding the proposed 
priorities of the objectives and investigations (be specific, and 
provide justification)?
 
Sincerely, Lori S. Glaze VEXAG Chair

LPSC 2013 TOWN HALL: PLANETARY MAPPING AND CARTOGRAPHY, WHAT, WHEN, 
HOW? 

Wednesday, March 20, 12:00 to 1:00 p.m., Waterway Ballrooms 1–3

Planetary mapping is foundational to planetary science and exploration.  
This town hall discussion will highlight the need to use planetary data 
and turn them into useful, registered cartographic products, at known 
levels of accuracy to support the best-possible science and 
exploration. Talks include an introduction to planetary mapping, a 
report on Mars Science Laboratory landing site mapping, and a summary 
on the status and needs for small body mapping. If you use planetary 
data, this meeting is for you! For more information, see:

REMINDER: CALL FOR CHAPTERS FOR ASTEROIDS IV

Deadline: March 31, 2013

Dear Colleagues,

This message is a solicitation for ideas for chapter topics and a
solicitation for volunteers for chapter authors for the book
Asteroids IV. If you would like to recommend chapters for the book, 
or would like to volunteer to write a particular chapter as a first
author, we would like to know no later than March 31st, 2013. The
Asteroids IV web site includes the call for chapters and instructions
that can be seen and downloaded:

http://www.oca.eu/michel/ASTEROIDSIV/

The SOC will then make the final choice of chapters, based on the
received ideas and its own conclusions. Your participation would be 
an extremely valuable service to the asteroid and planetary science
community. It is our intention to make Asteroids IV as useful as
Asteroids (1979), Asteroids II (1989), and Asteroids III (2002) such
that it becomes the science community's primary reference manual for 
at least the next decade, and we hope you will volunteer to 
participate in this challenge.

On behalf of the co-Editors and SOC,

Best regards,

Patrick Michel
Editor, Asteroids IV

[PDS] MESSENGER DATA RELEASE 9

The Planetary Data System is pleased to announce Release 9 of data 
collected by the MErcury Surface, Space ENvironment, GEochemistry, and 
Ranging (MESSENGER) mission. MESSENGER entered orbit about Mercury on 
18 March 2011, the first spacecraft ever to do so. The primary orbital 
phase lasted one Earth-year, and the spacecraft will complete an 
extended year of orbital operations on 17 March 2013.

This release includes advanced products for the first time, created 
using data through 25 March 2012, encompassing the first two full 
Mercury solar days of orbital operations. This release extends the 
formatted raw and calibrated data available at the PDS for all seven 
MESSENGER science instruments and the radio science investigation 
from 25 March 2012 to 17 September 2012. SPICE data from launch 
through the end of this release are also included. With this 
release, data are now available for the third full Mercury solar day 
of MESSENGER orbital operations.

All data sets in this MESSENGER release can be accessed from:
