POSTPONEMENT OF THE 8TH INTERNATIONAL MARS CONFERENCE TO 2014

The impacts of sequestration on the Federal budget have led to new 
travel policies that severely constrain the participation of NASA 
center employees, including JPL, and other government employees (e.g., 
the U. S. Geological Survey) in scientific conferences, including the 
planned 8th International Mars Conference set for July 15-19 on the 
Caltech campus.  The current fiscal environment is sufficiently 
restrictive that we, the organizers of the conference, have decided 
to delay the meeting for one year, holding it instead in June/July of 
2014. We sought advice from the MEPAG Executive Committee, which 
unanimously concurred with our decision.

Although it was our strong preference to hold the conference this year, 
the meeting in 2014 will include even more results from Mars, including 
Curiosity’s further exploration of Gale Crater, as the rover will then 
be well into the second year of its primary science mission.  We look 
forward to a full conference in June/July 2014 and hope to see you 
there.

NASA POSTDOCTORAL FELLOWSHIPS

The NASA Postdoctoral Program (NPP) offers scientists and engineers 
unique opportunities to conduct research at NASA Centers. Each NPP 
fellowship opportunity is designed to advance NASA research in a 
specific project related to space science, earth science, aeronautics, 
exploration systems, lunar science, astrobiology, or astrophysics.

Applicants must have a Ph.D. or equivalent degree in hand before 
beginning the fellowship, but may apply while completing the degree 
requirements. U.S. citizens, Lawful Permanent Residents, and foreign 
nationals eligible for J-1 status as a Research Scholar may apply.

Stipends start at $53,500 per year, with supplements for high 
cost-of-living areas and for certain academic specialties. Financial 
assistance is available for relocation and health insurance, and 
$8,000 per year is provided for professional travel.

Applications are accepted three times each year: March 1, July 1, and 
November 1.

10TH INTERNATIONAL PLANETARY PROBE WORKSHOP
 
Sending space vehicles to other worlds is one of humankind’s most 
challenging and rewarding ventures. The 10th International Planetary 
Probe Workshop (IPPW-10) will bring together engineers, technologists, 
scientists, mission designers, space agency leaders, and students from 
around the world for a compelling, week-long collaboration focused on 
exploring solar system destinations via in-situ missions.

This 10th workshop will build upon the IPPW tradition by encouraging 
international cooperation in planetary probe missions, new 
technologies, and scientific discoveries. In addition, students from 
around the world will have a unique opportunity to present their work 
and to interact with the leaders in their discipline areas.

GOLDSCHMIDT SESSION: MARTIAN EVOLUTION - ANCIENT MESSENGERS AND MODERN 
MEASUREMENTS

We would like to encourage you to participate in the session 02b 
"Martian Evolution; Ancient Messengers and Modern Measurements" at the 
next Goldschmidt conference which will take place in beautiful 
Florence on August 25-30, 2013.
 
Keynote speaker: Laurie Leshin (Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute)
The deadline for submitting abstracts is Friday, April 12th, 2013, 
23.59 GMT. For more information, see: 

http://goldschmidt.info/2013/index
 
Our knowledge of formation and geochemical evolution of Mars is 
rapidly increasing through chemical, isotopic, and petrologic analysis 
of martian meteorites, direct analysis and modeling of modern surfaces, 
and studies of analogue sites such as impact and volcanic crater 
environments. Deciphering these records and place them in proper 
context on Mars is particularly important to enhance our understanding 
of the conditions for the formation of interior and surface of planets 
present within the habitable zone. We strongly encourage a broad 
participation of planetary scientists to present new mineralogical, 
geochemical, geophysical, and biogeochemical studies relevant to 
terrestrial planet evolution and astrobiological processes related to 
Mars in order to better portray these systems in depth and through 
time.
 
We hope to see you in Florence!
Audrey Bouvier (University of Minnesota) and Desmond Moser (University 
of Western Ontario)
