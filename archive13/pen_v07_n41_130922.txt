[NASA] MDAP PROPOSAL DUE DATE DELAYED

The objective of the Mars Data Analysis Program (MDAP) is to enhance 
the scientific return from missions to Mars conducted by NASA and 
other space agencies. These include, but are not limited to, the 
following missions: Mars Pathfinder (MPF), Mars Global Surveyor (MGS), 
Mars Odyssey (MO), Mars Exploration Rovers (MERs), Mars Express (MEX), 
Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO), and Phoenix (PHX). MDAP broadens 
scientific participation in the analysis of mission data sets and 
funds high-priority areas of research that support planning for 
future Mars missions. MDAP supports scientific investigations of 
Mars using publicly available (released) data.

The proposal due date for Appendix C.12, the Mars Data Analysis 
Program, has been delayed by two weeks due to loss of power caused 
by flooding in Colorado. The new due date for proposals is 
Friday, October 4, 2013.

AGU SESSION P030 - THERMAL MODELING OF TERRESTRIAL AND PLANETARY BODIES

This session gives us an opportunity to share our science results and 
techniques with the broad thermal modeling community, rather than just 
our narrow sub-discipline. Our hope is that this session will foster 
communication and facilitate collaborations between subdisciplines. 

Thermal modeling techniques are used to understand a broad range of 
geologic and atmospheric problems on solid planetary bodies, including 
but not limited to Earth, Europa, Io, Mars, and Titan. Examples of 
such problems include the cooling of lava flows, volcano/geothermal 
monitoring, surface and near sub-surface physical properties, crater 
deformation, and icerock interactions. The techniques used to address 
thermal modeling-related questions are often applicable across many 
disciplines, datasets, and topics. By sharing scientific results 
and/or thermal modeling techniques and applications from a broad 
range of sub-disciplines, we will foster interdisciplinary 
collaboration and cooperation within the diverse thermal modeling 
community.

NASA POSTDOCTORAL FELLOWSHIPS

The NASA Postdoctoral Program (NPP) provides opportunities for 
scientists and engineers to conduct research largely of their own 
choosing, yet compatible with the research opportunities posted on 
the NPP Web site.

Selected by a competitive peer-review process, NPP Fellows complete 
one- to three-year Fellowship appointments that advance NASA's 
missions in earth science, heliophysics, planetary science, 
astrophysics, space bioscience, aeronautics and engineering, human 
exploration and space operations, and astrobiology.

A sample research opportunity is posted at:
 
https://www3.orau.gov/NPDoc/Catalog/18421   

Applicants must have a Ph.D. or equivalent degree in hand before 
beginning the fellowship, but may apply while completing the degree 
requirements. U. S. citizens, Lawful Permanent Residents, and 
foreign nationals eligible for J-1 status as a Research Scholar
may apply.

Stipends start at $53,500 per year, with supplements for high cost-
of-living areas and for certain academic specialties. Financial 
assistance is available for relocation and health insurance, and 
$8,000 per year is provided for professional travel.

Applications are accepted three times each year: March 1, July 1, 
and November 1.

Ames Research Center Job Announcement AR13B0014, 
Research Space Scientist, AST, Planetary Studies, GS-1330-12/13

https://www.usajobs.gov/GetJob/ViewDetails/349635800

The Exobiology Branch (Code SSX) at NASA Ames Research Center is 
currently seeking interested applicants for the position of Research 
Space Scientist. The incumbent is responsible for conducting 
microbiological and/or geologic research to identify biosignatures 
that characterize past/present life in environments related to 
astrobiology. He/she studies the origin, composition, structure, 
and evolution of the solar system, including planets and satellites; 
the Earth and Moon; and meteorites, asteroids, comets and dust. As a 
Research Space Scientist, the incumbent is responsible for conducting 
research involving modern field samples, ancient terrestrial rocks, 
meteorites, extraterrestrial materials, ices, Mars analog rocks, 
and returned data from spaceflight missions. He/she conducts 
research that emphasizes on the elucidation and characterization 
of modern, ancient, or extraterrestrial habitable zones and mineral 
biosignature. This includes the evaluation of preservation potential 
related to biosignatures; primary/secondary mineral phases 
associated with habitable zones; and the development of databases, 
microbial specimens, and geological collections for planetary studies 
and spacecraft missions.

PDS4 WORKSHOP AT DENVER DPS

The PDS Small Bodies Node is pleased to announce that it will be 
offering a hands-on workshop in PDS4 data standards and data set 
development at the upcoming DPS meeting in Denver:

Getting Acquainted with PDS4 Standards in Time for Comet ISON

Time: 9:00am-12:00pm
Date: Wednesday, 9 October 2013
Location: Governer's Square 17

Observations of Comet ISON destined to be archived in the PDS will 
be coming in under the brand-new PDS4 data standards. In this workshop 
we will provide a brief intro to the new standards, and then provide 
sample files and real-time help getting you set up to work with XML, 
schemas, and the new PDS standards. PDS personnel will be on hand to 
answer questions and guide you through the process of creating basic 
labels for the most common data types. Bring your laptops and a 
thumbdrive. Sample data of your own is welcome!

A web page for posting sample data and additional information of 
interest is available at:
