INTERNATIONAL PRIMITIVE BODY EXPLORATION WORKING GROUP (IPEWG) MEETING
 
We are pleased to announce that the third Meeting of the IPEWG 2013
will be held May 29-31 2013 in Nice, France. Information regarding 
meeting goals, logistics and registration are indicated on the 
following web site (to be completed, so please check it regularly):

http://www.oca.eu/michel/IPEWG2013/
 
Discussions held at IPEWG 2013 are expected to impact and improve 
international collaboration activities for primitive body space 
exploration. We expect the workshop to come up with a prioritized 
set of recommendations to be included in a charter. We hope you will 
attend and participate in this important program.
 
Please note that IPEWG2013 is followed by a MarcoPolo-R International 
Symposium (ESA primitive asteroid sample return mission in competition 
in the M3 class mission) at ESTEC (The Netherlands) on June 3-4, 2013. 
Direct low-cost flights from Nice to Amsterdam can be used to attend 
this symposium.
 
We are currently working on the program of the workshop and to invite 
subject experts as we prepare to build on the successes of IPEWG 2008 
and 2011. Please contact Patrick Michel, LOC Chair (michelp@oca.eu) 
with any questions.

NASA POSTDOCTORAL FELLOWSHIPS

The NASA Postdoctoral Program (NPP) offers scientists and engineers 
unique opportunities to conduct research at NASA Centers. Each NPP 
fellowship opportunity is designed to advance NASA research in a 
specific project related to space science, earth science, aeronautics, 
exploration systems, lunar science, astrobiology, or astrophysics.

Applicants must have a Ph.D. or equivalent degree in hand before 
beginning the fellowship, but may apply while completing the degree 
requirements. U. S. citizens, Lawful Permanent Residents, and foreign 
nationals eligible for J-1 status as a Research Scholar may apply.

Stipends start at $53,500 per year, with supplements for high cost-
of-living areas and for certain academic specialties. Financial 
assistance is available for relocation and health insurance, and 
$8,000 per year is provided for professional travel.

Applications are accepted three times each year: March 1, July 1, 
and November 1.

INTERNSHIP OPPORTUNITIES AT JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY APPLIED PHYSICS 
LABORATORY

The Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory is engineering the future 
of space exploration - examining Earth's near-space environment, our 
Sun, planetary bodies and the outer solar system. The NASA/APL 
Internship Program provides unique opportunities for university 
students to work on NASA missions or other space-related research 
opportunities at APL.  

Join us for 10 weeks this summer, and be a part of this extreme 
exploration!

To apply, visit:

https://www.APLapp.com

Deadline for submittals: January 28, 2013

The Applied Physics Laboratory (APL) is a not-for-profit center for 
engineering, research, and development. Located north of Washington, 
DC, APL is a division of one of the world's premier research 
universities, The Johns Hopkins University.

POSTDOC - BOSTON UNIVERSITY - CURIOSITY AND MARS ATMOSPHERE

The Center for Space Physics at Boston University invites applications
for a postdoctoral researcher position supervised by Professor Paul
Withers. The research will involve the analysis of accelerometer and
other measurements made by Curiosity during its descent to the surface
of Mars, leading to an accurate reconstruction of the atmospheric
conditions encountered by Curiosity and subsequent scientific
interpretation of these results. Candidates should possess a PhD degree
in a relevant field. Experience conducting research on planetary
atmospheres and/or experience working with spacecraft observations are
desirable. The salary offered will be competitive and commensurate with
experience. Funding is available for two years with the possibility of
extension. The appointment is expected to begin as soon as possible
after 1 April 2013. Please contact Paul Withers (withers@bu.edu) for
further information.

Applications should be sent by email to Paul Withers (withers@bu.edu).
The application should be submitted in PDF format and contain a
curriculum vitae, statement of research interests, and contact
information for three referees. Review of applications will begin on 28
February 2013. Women and underrepresented minorities are particularly
encouraged to apply. Boston University is an equal
opportunity/affirmative action employer.

[NASA] SOLAR SYSTEM EXPLORATION RESEARCH VIRTUAL INSTITUTE COOPERATIVE 
AGREEMENT NOTICE

Solar System Exploration Research Virtual Institute (SSERVI) 
Cooperative Agreement Notice (CAN) released NASA's Science Mission 
Directorate and Human Exploration and Operations Mission Directorate 
have jointly released a CAN, available at:

http://tinyurl.com/SSERVI

to solicit multi-institutional team-based proposals focusing on basic 
and applied scientific questions fundamental to understanding the Moon, 
Near Earth Asteroids, the Martian moons, and the near space 
environments  of these target bodies. The date and time for a 
community-wide virtual Q and A session to discuss the CAN will be 
announced shortly. Upon selection of the ~7 new teams in the latter 
half of 2013, the NASA Lunar Science Institute (NLSI) will become
the Solar System Exploration Research Virtual Institute (SSERVI). 
Although the teams will be new, there will be no change in leadership 
or management location. SSERVI will be directed by Dr. Yvonne 
Pendleton and managed by the current NLSI staff located at NASA Ames 
Research Center. The sixth NASA Lunar Science Forum, hosted by the 
NLSI at Ames Research Center, is planned for July 16-19, 2013,
with its primary focus on lunar science. In future years, the forum 
will include the expanded scope of the new virtual institute, SSERVI.

MEPAG #27 CANCELLATION NOTICE

Delays in the federal budget process means that the President's 
traditional budget message is unlikely to occur by the time of the 
presently scheduled February 26 and 27th MEPAG meeting in Washington 
D.C. You are surely all aware of the announcement in December at the 
Fall AGU meeting by Associate Administrator John Grunsfeld that NASA 
intends to launch a new rover to Mars in 2020. However, the 2020 Rover 
Science Definition Team is just now being formed and will not be far 
enough into its deliberations to give a meaningful out-brief in 
February. 

We have decided to cancel the two-day physical meeting and to replace 
it with a half-day electronic meeting (e.g., WEBEX), tentatively 
scheduled for the afternoon (EST) of either February 26 or 27.  

At that time the community can be briefed on changes in MEP leadership 
(Doug McCuisition has retired), status of budget planning within MEP 
and PSD, and the new thrust in Mars exploration, including the 
membership, charter and status of the 2020 Rover SDT. 

Details will follow when they are available. 

We apologize for any inconvenience.

PHD RESEARCHER IN THE FIELD OF GEOMICROBIOLOGY

We seek a highly motivated PhD student to join us in the petrology 
group at Faculty of Geosciences in Utrecht University in the 
Netherlands. The aim of the PhD project is to develop techniques with 
nickel isotopes to detect the activity of methanogenic archaea and 
reverse methanogenesis in diverse environments. Focus will be given 
to methanogens from volcanic areas in order to determine if microbial 
activity can enhance Ni release from Ni-containing minerals. Part of 
the work will be carried out with collaborating research groups at 
Wageningen University and the ETH in Zurich, Switzerland.

Requirements: You should have an MSc degree in geochemistry, 
(geo)microbiology, environmental sciences or a related field, with 
experience of laboratory work, and preferably a strong interest in 
isotope geochemistry and its application to problems in Early history. 
You should communicate easily in English, both verbally and in writing.
This is a temporary position for 4 years. The gross monthly salary 
increases from euro 2,042 (year 1) to euro 2,612 (year 4).

Dr. Paul Mason, p.mason@uu.nl or 
Dr. Melike Balk, m.balk@uu.nl
