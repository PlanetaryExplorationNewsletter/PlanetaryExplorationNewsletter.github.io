ICARUS SPECIAL ISSUE - DARK AND BRIGHT MATERIALS ON VESTA

The Dawn mission discovered bright and dark regions on Vesta. 
Preliminary analysis leads to a simple hypothesis that the bright 
material is perhaps the original crustal material of Vesta, while 
the dark material represents non-native, OH-rich material originated 
from elsewhere in the asteroid belt.  The diverse albedo observed on 
Vesta appears to be due to varying amounts of the dark material mixed 
with the original surface. The method of emplacement, origin, and role 
of dark material in providing Vesta with volatiles are all unknown.  
Coordinating with the Dawn Science Team, Icarus is soliciting 
submissions of papers to a special issue on this topic. These papers 
will be focused on the most detailed, follow-up studies of the dark 
and bright materials on Vesta. The topics include, but are NOT 
limited to:

* Characterizations of dark and bright materials on Vesta
* Composition, origin, and evolution of dark and bright material
* Process of transportation of dark material and mixing process 
  in the regolith
* Laboratory analysis of HEDs and other meteoritic analogues such as 
  carbonaceous chondrites and exogenous clasts, as well as possible 
  terrestrial analogues 

Submission Deadline: May 15, 2013

RESEARCH & INSTRUMENT ANALYST

The Space Telescope Science Institute has openings for Research and 
Instrument Analysts (RIA) in our Instruments Division. RIAs will 
assist Instrument Scientists in the reduction and analysis of Hubble 
Space Telescope calibration data. Analysts will also assist in the 
development and testing of the scientific instruments for the James 
Webb Space Telescope. They will provide User Support to HST General 
Observers and Archival Researchers in various aspects of observation 
planning and data reduction. Additionally, the RIA may also provide 
research support for scientific programs of staff scientists.

Applicants must have a Bachelor's degree in Astronomy, Physics, 
Astrophysics, Planetary Science, or related fields as well as 
experience with astronomical research, familiarity with scientific 
computing, expertise in data analysis, knowledge of IRAF and/or IDL, 
or other software packages, and programming ability. Applications 
received by May 31, 2013 will receive full consideration. STScI sees 
the diversity of our staff as a strategic priority in our desire to 
create a first-rate scientific community. We reflect that deep 
commitment in strongly encouraging women, minorities, veterans and 
disabled individuals to apply for these opportunities. Interested 
candidates are requested to complete an on-line application by

NASA POSTDOCTORAL FELLOWSHIPS

The NASA Postdoctoral Program (NPP) offers scientists and engineers 
unique opportunities to conduct research at NASA Centers. Each NPP 
fellowship opportunity is designed to advance NASA research in a 
specific project related to space science, earth science, aeronautics, 
exploration systems, lunar science, astrobiology, or astrophysics.

Applicants must have a Ph.D. or equivalent degree in hand before 
beginning the fellowship, but may apply while completing the degree 
requirements. U. S. citizens, Lawful Permanent Residents, and foreign 
nationals eligible for J-1 status as a Research Scholar may apply.
 
Stipends start at $53,500 per year, with supplements for high cost-
of-living areas and for certain academic specialties. Financial 
assistance is available for relocation and health insurance, and 
$8,000 per year is provided for professional travel.

Applications are accepted three times each year: March 1, July 1, 
and November 1.

FIRST SCIENTIFIC SESSION ON THE CHELYABINSK BOLIDE

A special session on the Chelyabinsk event of February 15 will be held 
Sunday, April 14 (1900-2130), at the beginning of the Planetary Defense 
Conference in Flagstaff, AZ, April 14-19. In view of wide public 
and press interest in this unique meteor strike, this special session 
is open to the public as well as those registered at the Conference. 
It will be the first scientific analysis of what happened on 
February 15, and the implications for planetary defense generally.
