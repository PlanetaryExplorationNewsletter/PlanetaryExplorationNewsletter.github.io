JOB ANNOUNCEMENT USRA

USRA is seeking one or more scientific staff positions in the 
Planetary Radar Astronomy department studying near-Earth asteroids and 
other bodies with the Arecibo Observatory Planetary Radar system.

This position would involve observations, data processing, archiving,
and modeling of near-Earth asteroids and other bodies with the
Arecibo Planetary radar system. Experience with radar observations and
techniques is *not* a prerequisite. Experience and interest in 
astronomical observations of Solar System objects, small-bodies 
geophysics, and/or numerical inverse modeling are desirable. 
Applications can be accepted at the technical staff (M.S. or 
equivalent experience), post-doc (Ph.D.), or research scientist 
(Ph.D + relevant experience) levels.

The incumbent would be resident in Arecibo, Puerto Rico and be an
employee of Universities Space Research Association. Ph.D. level
researchers (post-doc or research scientist) would be expected to
maintain an independent research program and encouraged to apply for
partial funding support.

For technical information, please contact Mike Nolan <nolan@naic.edu>.

USRA is an Equal Opportunity Employer.

EGU2014 SESSION GM2.1 - DIGITAL LANDSCAPES: INSIGHTS INTO 
GEOMORPHOLOGICAL PROCESSES

Dear Colleagues,

After a vibrant session in 2013 with exciting planetary presentations 
we would value your contribution to our session on extracting insights 
into processes from digital landscapes.

Session GM2.1 Digital Landscapes: Insights into geomorphological 
processes from quantitative interrogation and use at EGU2014 (Vienna, 
Austria 27 April - 2 May 2014)

We encourage abstracts which concern the exploitation of elevation 
data for geomorphological analysis. This inter-disciplinary session 
will highlight developments driving innovation in the exciting uses 
of digital landscapes (DEM, DTM, or DSM) of the Earth, seafloor or 
planetary terrains. Much interest is expected in high-resolution DEMs 
on Earth, but any data source (e.g. laser scanning, SAR, 
photogrammetry, structure from motion, satellite-derived) is welcome.
 
A full description of the session can be found at: 

http://meetingorganizer.copernicus.org/EGU2014/session/14779
 
Deadline for receipt of abstracts: 16 January 2014 at 13:00 CET

All the best,

John Hillier (convener)
Paolo Tarolli, Susan Conway (co-conveners)

PLANETARY GEOMORPHOLOGY EGU 2014 - STUDENT TRAVEL SUPPORT DEADLINE: 
29 NOVEMBER

Students - the deadline for financial support applications is fast 
approaching - 29th November! To qualify you must submit your abstract 
by this date!

Planetary Geomorphology at EGU 2014 (Vienna Austria 27 April-2 May) 
GM10.1: The Planetary Geomorphology session welcomes abstracts 
concerning landforms and the processes that shape them on all solar 
system bodies. Earth analogue studies, flume/simulation work and 
novel approaches using remote sensing data are especially encouraged. 
This session has always provided a stimulating forum for cross-
disciplinary discussion and we hope you'll join us once again to bring 
geomorphology and planetary science closer together. The final 
deadline for abstracts is 16th January 2013.

POST-DOCTORAL POSITIONS AT THE UNIVERSITY OF ARIZONA

As part of a new terrestrial analogs initiative for planetary sciences 
research within the Lunar and Planetary Laboratory (LPL), talented 
scientists and engineers with backgrounds in geology, geophysics, 
applied mathematics, mechanical/electrical engineering, informatics, 
and/or computer sciences are encouraged to apply. Successful 
applicants will work as part of a multi-disciplinary research team, 
with opportunities for field-based and experimental research, 
geologic remote sensing of planetary surfaces, and geophysical 
modeling.

Research topics in Earth and Planetary Sciences will include: 
(1) development and deployment of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs); 
(2) fluid dynamic modeling of magma, lava, aqueous floods, and/or 
debris flows; 
(3) thermal-infrared imaging and thermodynamic modeling of volcanic 
processes; and 
(4) informatics and machine learning applications to geologic pattern 
recognition and data analysis.

The appointment will be full-time (1.0 FTE) for one year, with the 
possibility of renewal for up to three years, contingent upon 
satisfactory performance and funding. Salary is commensurate with 
experience, but will be competitive and in keeping with other leading 
institutions in the United States. For full position details and to 
apply online, see:

NASA POSTDOCTORAL FELLOWSHIPS

The NASA Postdoctoral Program (NPP) provides opportunities for 
scientists and engineers to conduct research largely of their own 
choosing, yet compatible with the research opportunities posted on the 
NPP Web site.

Selected by a competitive peer-review process, NPP Fellows complete 
one- to three-year Fellowship appointments that advance NASA's
missions in earth science, heliophysics, planetary science, 
astrophysics, space bioscience, aeronautics and engineering, human 
exploration and space operations, and astrobiology.

A sample research opportunity in planetary science is:

https://www3.orau.gov/NPDoc/Catalog/18624      

Applicants must have a Ph.D. or equivalent degree in hand before 
beginning the fellowship, but may apply while completing the degree 
requirements. U. S. citizens, Lawful Permanent Residents, and foreign 
nationals eligible for J-1 status as a Research Scholar may apply.

Stipends start at $53,500 per year, with supplements for high cost-
of-living areas and for certain academic specialties. Financial 
assistance is available for relocation and health insurance, and 
$8,000 per year is provided for professional travel.

Applications are accepted three times each year: March 1, July 1, 
and November 1.
