IMPACT OF US GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN ON DPS CONFERENCE

In case the government shutdown continues and civil servants cannot 
travel to the DPS meeting, we are issuing the following guidelines:

- Presenters who are affected may ask a colleague to give their 
  presentations.
- We are trying to assess if hotel cancellations will impact our 
  minimum hotel block. If you cancel your reservation at the Sheraton, 
  please email Kim Earle (kim.earle@aas.org)
- We cannot refund registration fees. In exceptional cases, where this 
  would cause personal hardship, we will consider the request after 
  the meeting, once we know our financial status.
- We will still go ahead with Agency Night, on Tuesday next week from 
  7:30 to 9:00 pm, re-arranging the program and speakers if needed.

We sincerely hope that the US government issues will get resolved in 
the next few days and that our civil servant colleagues will be able 
to come to Denver.
