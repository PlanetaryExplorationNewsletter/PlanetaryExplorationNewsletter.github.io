[NASA] VOLUNTEER FOR REVIEW PANELS

[NASA] FEWER NEW AWARDS EXPECTED FOR ROSES ORIGINS OF SOLAR SYSTEMS

The selection rate for the Planetary Science Division (PSD)
part of last year's (2012) Origins of Solar Systems program was ~10%, 
half of what it was it has been in recent years. We don't expect the 
selection rate to improve this year, and at the present time we must 
assume that the budget situation will be similar next fiscal year, so 
we felt it important to communicate the situation to proposers to the 
ROSES 2013 Origins call. To reflect this new reality, we have diminished 
the expected funding amounts for new selections in the summary table 
of key information at the end of the call.

Questions concerning this message regarding the Planetary Science 
Division portion of Appendix E.3, The Origins of Solar System Program,
may be addressed to Christina Richey or Max Bernstein at
HQ-OSS@mail.nasa.gov

EPSC 2013: SMALL BODIES SESSION 10 "COMETS ON THE EVE OF ROSETTA:
OBSERVATIONS, LABORATORY SIMULATIONS AND MODELLING"

September 8-13, 2013
European Planetary Science Congress 2013
http://www.epsc2013.eu
London, United Kingdom

With only a few months left to the arrival of the Rosetta spacecraft 
at its main destination, comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, we invite 
the comet community to compile a broad overview of our pre-Rosetta 
knowledge on comets. We also wish to encourage cross-disciplinary 
awareness between the various aspects of comets and methods used in 
their study, which will be crucial for the interpretation of the data 
collected by Rosetta. You are therefore invited to present your recent 
results related to past- and on-going space missions, observational 
studies from ground and from space, laboratory simulation, and 
theoretical modelling.

Abstract submission deadline: May 6, 2013

AND PERCHLORATES

Reminder: Research manuscripts are being accepted for a special issue 
of American Mineralogist on the topic of Martian Sulfates, Phosphates, 
and Perchlorates. Papers related to these minerals are welcome (e.g., 
discoveries of sulfates, phosphates, or perchlorates from surface 
missions and orbital spacecraft data; laboratory analyses and 
thermodynamic modeling relating to the hydration state of these
minerals and their stability on Mars; etc.)

The deadline for submission is May 1, 2013, but the date is a bit 
flexible, if need be. If you have not already done so, please email 
the editors below with your indication of interest. Submissions can 
be made at:

NASA POSTDOCTORAL FELLOWSHIPS

The NASA Postdoctoral Program (NPP) offers scientists and engineers 
unique opportunities to conduct research at NASA Centers. Each NPP 
fellowship opportunity is designed to advance NASA research in a 
specific project related to space science, earth science, aeronautics, 
exploration systems, lunar science, astrobiology, or astrophysics.

Applicants must have a Ph.D. or equivalent degree in hand before 
beginning the fellowship, but may apply while completing the degree 
requirements. U. S. citizens, Lawful Permanent Residents, and foreign 
nationals eligible for J-1 status as a Research Scholar may apply.

Stipends start at $53,500 per year, with supplements for high cost-
of-living areas and for certain academic specialties. Financial 
assistance is available for relocation and health insurance, and 
$8,000 per year is provided for professional travel.

Applications are accepted three times each year: March 1, July 1, 
and November 1.

LUNAR SCIENCE FORUM 2013 IMPORTANT CHANGES

LSF2013 will be a VIRTUAL conference with NO "in-person" component 
this year!

NEW Abstract Deadline: May 8, 2013 (midnight)

Due to the recent government restrictions on travel, the NASA Lunar 
Science Institute will broadcast the annual NASA Lunar Science Forum 
(LSF) as a virtual conference the week of July 15-19, 2013. The 
conference will be broadcast approximately 6 hours per day between 
the hours of 8 a.m.-4 p.m. PDT, Monday-Friday. Depending on the 
time zones covered by selected abstracts, the final schedule may 
start earlier or later to accommodate international participation. 

For more information about the format, abstract submission and 
logistics, please visit:

http://lunarscience.nasa.gov/LSF2013/

Please send ideas for potential creative ways to use the virtual 
format to Brad Bailey (brad.bailey@nasa.gov)

The NLSI will transition to the Solar System Exploration Research 
Virtual Institute (SSERVI) later in 2013, making it likely that the 
content for the forum will expand in future years. Please guarantee 
that this year's Lunar Science Forum is packed with lunar highlights 
by submitting your abstract soon. We look forward to another exciting 
meeting focusing on science Of, On and From the Moon!

[NASA] EDUCATION AND PUBLIC OUTREACH FOR EARTH AND SPACE SCIENCE 
(EPOESS) ON HOLD

Opportunities in Education and Public Outreach for Earth and Space 
Science (EPOESS), is on hold pending review by NASA's Education 
Coordinating Council (ECC).

The EPOESS solicitation is for project activities utilizing SMD 
content supporting NASA education and public outreach (E/PO) 
objectives. It solicits proposals that address substantial and 
substantive educational or outreach needs or problems and offer 
solutions of significant impact. Project activities are expected to 
be relevant to NASA SMD Education and Outreach portfolio.

Given the consolidation of Federal STEM education programs in the 
President's FY 2014 budget, see:

http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/budget/fy2014/
assets/nasa.pdf

NASA has decided to put the EPOESS program on hold pending review 
by the Education Coordinating Council in late May. The proposal 
due date for Appendix E.4, EPOESS is now TBD. The final disposition 
of the EPOESS program will be made public in early June. If 
solicited, the proposal due date will be no less than 90 days 
from the date of Amendment.

Questions concerning EPOESS, may be directed to:

ASTROBIOLOGY ROADMAP
 
Be a part of the future of Astrobiology! It's time to chart the future 
directions of astrobiology research and you can participate. During 
the month of May, NASA will be hosting a series of on-line hangouts 
and discussions focusing on broad themes in astrobiology: Planetary 
Conditions for Life, Prebiotic Evolution, Early Evolution of Life and 
the Biosphere, Evolution of Advanced Life, and Astrobiology for Solar
Systems Exploration. The online conversations will then be used as 
the starting point for an in-person/virtual meeting to draft an 
outline for the Roadmap. To take part in this important conversation 
and to receive updates, please register at the following website:
