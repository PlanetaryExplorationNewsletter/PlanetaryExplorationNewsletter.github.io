WORKSHOP ON THE EVOLUTION AND CONSTITUTION OF MERCURY'S INTERIOR

April 22-24, 2013

The workshop Evolution and Constitution of Mercury's Interior will be 
held April 22-24, 2013 at the Congress Plaza Hotel in Chicago, IL. 
This international meeting will explore recent results from NASA's 
MESSENGER mission as well as implications for the forthcoming 
ESA/JAXA BepiColombo mission. The workshop is organized around three 
thematic issues regarding Mercury's interior:

Origin, structure, and bulk composition of Mercury
Evolution of Mercury's crust and mantle        
Core evolution and magnetic field generation at Mercury

Registration, presentation submissions, and additional information are
available at:

NASA POSTDOCTORAL FELLOWSHIPS

The NASA Postdoctoral Program (NPP) offers scientists and engineers 
unique opportunities to conduct research at NASA Centers. Each NPP 
fellowship opportunity is designed to advance NASA research in a 
specific project related to space science, earth science, aeronautics, 
exploration systems, lunar science, astrobiology, or astrophysics.

Applicants must have a Ph.D. or equivalent degree in hand before 
beginning the fellowship, but may apply while completing the degree 
requirements. U. S. citizens, Lawful Permanent Residents, and foreign 
nationals eligible for J-1 status as a Research Scholar may apply.

Stipends start at $53,500 per year, with supplements for high cost-
of-living areas and for certain academic specialties. Financial 
assistance is available for relocation and health insurance, and 
$8,000 per year is provided for professional travel.

Applications are accepted three times each year: March 1, July 1, 
and November 1.

VENUS LUNCH-TIME TOWN-HALL MEETING AND EARLY CAREER SCHOLARS MIXER 
AT LPSC, WEDNESDAY - MARCH 20, 2013

You are invited to participate in a lunch-time (12:00-13:15) Venus 
Town-Hall Meeting during the LPSC on Wednesday, March 20, 2013, 
in the Waterway 6-8 Rooms. This is hosted by the Venus Exploration 
Analysis Group (VEXAG).

The primary objective of the Town Hall meeting is to encourage a 
community discussion and feedback on proposed updates and changes 
to the Goals, Objectives and Investigations for Venus Exploration. 
Proposed updates will be made available via the VEXAG web site 

http://www.lpi.usra.edu/vexag/

prior to LPSC. Also, the VEXAG Venus Exploration Roadmap Topical 
Analysis Group will brief attendees on their efforts to develop a 
roadmap for Venus exploration consistent with the Decadal Survey.

The VEXAG Early Career Scholars Focus Group will be hosting a 
casual mixer for students, postdocs and young scientists interested 
in Venus. The mixer will take place following the Venus oral session 
on Wednesday. Please check the VEXAG - Early Career Scholars Facebook 
page for more information:

MESSENGER MDIS DATA USERS' WORKSHOP

Since entering orbit in 2011, MESSENGER's Mercury Dual Imaging System 
(MDIS) has acquired >100,000 images of Mercury's surface and created 
the first global maps of the Solar System's innermost planet. A 
MESSENGER MDIS Data Users' Workshop will be held in association with 
the 44th Lunar and Planetary Science Conference on Sunday, March 17, 
2013, from 2:00 PM - 6:00 PM. This workshop will introduce the 
available MDIS products, the calibrations applied, and tools for 
finding and using MDIS data, and is intended for anyone interested in 
using the data. To learn more about this workshop and to register, 
visit the MDIS Data Users' Workshop website:

CALL FOR PROPOSALS FOR THE NASA INFRARED TELESCOPE FACILITY (IRTF)

Deadline: 01 April 2013

NASA Infrared Telescope Facility Observing Proposals. The due date for 
the 2013B semester (August 1, 2013 to January 31, 2014) is Monday, 
April 1, 2013. See our online submission form. Information on available 
facility and visitor instruments can be found at: 

http://irtfweb.ifa.hawaii.edu/Facility/

Remote observing is available with SpeX, NSFCAM, CSHELL, and MORIS. 
NSFCAM has been upgraded with a new array; please see the instrument 
webpage for more information.

Important notice: SpeX will be available for the 2013B semester. We 
now anticipate that SpeX will be taken off line on Feb. 01, 2014, 
and will be unavailable for the entire 2014A semester (Feb. 1, 2014 - 
July 31, 2014).

C/2012 S1 (ISON) observing campaign: We encourage proposals to observe 
comet C/2012 S1 (ISON), a recently discovered Oort Cloud comet with 
perihelion passage on Nov. 28, 2013. Approximately 170 hours of 
observing time will be set aside for this campaign. All data obtained 
will be made public (within one week), and observing logs will be 
requested for archiving. We encourage observing groups to form 
collaborations to enhance the scientific return from the observations.

10TH IAA LOW-COST PLANETARY MISSIONS CONFERENCE (LCPM-10)

The 10th International Academy of Astronautics Low-Cost Planetary 
Missions Conference, LCPM-10, will be held on the campus of the 
California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, California, on 
June 18-20, 2013. 

The focus of the 10th Low-Cost Planetary Missions Conference is on 
missions characterized by those of NASA's Discovery program and ESA's 
Cosmic Visions Medium-Class program. These missions of scientific 
exploration are conducted at a fixed cost that includes spacecraft 
and science payload development, launch, operations, science data 
analysis, and all relevant mission-specific technology development. 

The conference is a forum for planetary scientists, technologists, 
engineers, project managers and agency officials to gather for the 
exchange of information and ideas for making this class of robotic 
mission richer scientifically while remaining affordably low-cost. 

LCPM-10 will be followed on June 21, 2013, by an IAA-sponsored 
symposium celebrating the life and many accomplishments of Theodore 
von Karman. The von Karman symposium will also to be held on the 
Caltech Campus in Pasadena.

Please see http://lcpm10.caltech.edu/ for further information or 
contact the organizing committee at lcpm@caltech.edu.

[NASA] ROSES-13 THE ORIGINS OF SOLAR SYSTEMS PROGRAM

The Origins of Solar Systems program solicits basic research proposals 
to conduct scientific investigations related to understanding the 
formation and early evolution of planetary systems and to provide 
the fundamental research and analysis necessary to detect and 
characterize other planetary systems. These investigations may involve 
analytical and numerical modeling, laboratory research, and 
observational studies in the following areas: star formation and the 
relationship to planetary system formation, solar nebula processes,
accumulation and dynamical evolution, analysis of primitive materials, 
and the detection and characterization of other planetary systems.

A number of changes have been made to Appendix E.3, The Origins of 
Solar Systems Program. The due dates remain unchanged: 
NOIs due March 22, 2013
Proposals due May 23, 2013

LRO DIVINER DATA USERS FORUM AT LPSC ON SUNDAY, MARCH 17

The LRO Diviner Science Team will host a public Diviner Data Users 
Forum on Sunday, March 17 from 3 to 5pm in the College Park Room at 
the Woodlands Waterway Marriott Hotel in Houston, TX. The purpose of 
the forum will be to acquaint the community with Diviner's new high-
level mapped data products. These products include global maps of 
brightness temperature, solar reflectance, composition and 
thermophysical properties. This extensive new dataset will be made 
available via the NASA PDS Geosciences Node on March 15, 2013. The 
forum will also provide an opportunity for potential users to ask 
questions and provide feedback to the team. This is a public meeting 
and all are invited.
