[NASA] 2013 EONS SOLICITATION

NASA's Office of Education is accepting new proposals under the 
Education Opportunities in NASA STEM (EONS) 2013 NASA Research 
Announcement. This is an umbrella announcement for opportunities under 
the Minority University Research and Education Program, or MUREP, and 
includes calls for proposals in the following program elements for 
FY 2013-2014: Tribal Colleges and Universities Experiential Learning
Opportunities (TCU ELO) and NASA Innovations in Climate Education - 
Tribal (NICE-T). Proposals for both opportunities are due July 24, 
2013.

For more information regarding these opportunities, please visit the 
NASA EONS page on the NSPIRES website at:

RELEASE OF SOFIA CYCLE 2 CALL FOR PROPOSALS

The Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy (SOFIA) is pleased 
to invite proposals for Cycle 2 observations, which will take place 
during calendar year 2014. The campaigns will be interspersed with 
instrument commissioning and an extended aircraft maintenance campaign.

The deadline for submitting proposals is June 28, 2013. Proposal 
selections will be announced in September 2013. Details of the Cycle 2 
Call for Proposals can be found at: 

http://www.sofia.usra.edu/Science/proposals/cycle2/

SOFIA is a 2.7m telescope, with an effective, unvignetted, diameter of 
2.5m, housed in a Boeing 747-SP aircraft. Observations are typically 
carried out at altitudes between 11.9 km (39,000 ft) and 13.7 km 
(45,000 ft.). These altitudes place the observatory above up to 99.8% 
of the obscuring atmospheric water vapor. There are six observatory 
instruments offered in this Call, which cover the range 0.3-250 
microns.

For questions and assistance, please contact the SOFIA help desk at 
sofia_help@sofia.usra.edu

NASA POSTDOCTORAL FELLOWSHIPS

The NASA Postdoctoral Program (NPP) offers scientists and engineers 
unique opportunities to conduct research at NASA Centers. Each NPP 
fellowship opportunity is designed to advance NASA research in a 
specific project related to space science, earth science, aeronautics, 
exploration systems, lunar science, astrobiology, or astrophysics.

Applicants must have a Ph.D. or equivalent degree in hand before 
beginning the fellowship, but may apply while completing the degree 
requirements. U. S. citizens, Lawful Permanent Residents, and foreign 
nationals eligible for J-1 status as a Research Scholar may apply.

Stipends start at $53,500 per year, with supplements for high 
cost-of-living areas and for certain academic specialties. Financial 
assistance is available for relocation and health insurance, and 
$8,000 per year is provided for professional travel.

Applications are accepted three times each year: March 1, July 1, and 
November 1.

MARS EXPLORATION SCINECE MONTHLY NEWSLETTER - MAY 2013

On behalf of Lisa Pratt (MEPAG Chair), Dave Beaty, Rich Zurek, and 
Charles Budney of the Mars Program Science Office, the May 2013 edition 
of the Mars Exploration Science Monthly Newsletter can be found on the 
web at:

On a separate topic, I'd like to take this opportunity to announce my 
retirement from the Jet Propulsion Laboratory on Thursday, May 2, 2013.  
It has been a pleasure to support the Mars science community and 
publish the newsletter for the past several years.

I'm happy to welcome Carla de la Paz, who will be taking over my 
responsibilities. Please send your Mars community announcements and 
calendar items for inclusion in the newsletter to Carla at 
paz@jpl.nasa.gov.

With my very best regards,
