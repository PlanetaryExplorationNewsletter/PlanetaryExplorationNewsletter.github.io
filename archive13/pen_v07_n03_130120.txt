HABITABLE WORLDS ACROSS SPACE AND TIME

Second Announcement: The 2013 STScI Spring Symposium
April 29 - May 2, 2013

Abstract submission deadline: March 15, 2013
On-line registration deadline: March 29, 2013

Within a matter of years, humanity will know for the first time the 
frequency of terrestrial planets in orbit around other stars. In this 
four-day symposium, scientists from diverse fields will discuss the 
formation and long-term evolution of terrestrial bodies throughout the 
various phases of stellar and Galactic evolution. A particular focus 
will be in how the specific conditions and challenges for habitability 
on Earth extend to other bodies in the Solar System and beyond. The 
existence of these overlooked environments may provide motivation for 
novel astronomical observations with existing and next generation 
ground and space-based observatories.

Registration for this Symposium is now open and there are a limited 
number of spots. Please go to:

http://www.stsci.edu/institute/conference/habitable-worlds

and click on the "Register" link. We also invite contributions in the 
form of talks and posters, which can be submitted during the 
registration process or after one has registered. Only a small number 
of contributed talks are available.

AOGS 2013, SESSION PS07: SPECTROPOLARIMETRIC EXPLORATION OF PLANETARY
SYSTEMS AND THEIR HABITABILITY

Brisbane, Australia
24-28 June 2013

Abstract due: 29 Jan 2013

Spectro-polarimetry is becoming a valuable  remote sensing tool to 
explore our solar system (including earth, planetary atmospheres, 
satellite, ring systems, comets, asteroids, trans-Neptunian objects, 
etc.) to understand its formation and evolution. With the increasing 
diversity of extrasolar planetary systems, it important to understand 
their formation and evolution and place our solar system in context. 
This session will include invited and contributed talks on: (i) 
application of the principles of polarization to remote sensing; and 
(ii) role of polarization as an independent and complementary remote 
sensing tool to imaging and spectroscopic techniques; (iii) 
laboratory measurements and modelling; (iv) instrumentation and 
missions and (v) astrobiology and habitability. We welcome both 
polarimetrists and non-polarimetrists (observers, theorists and 
experimentalists) that study planetary systems to identify the 
challenges and advances in this growing field.

11-15 November 2013
 
This Symposium is the first of a new series of events initiated by 
COSPAR which aims to promote space research at a regional level in 
emerging countries and will be held every two years in a different 
area of the world. The Symposium will include multidisciplinary and 
training sessions.
 
This first Symposium will address the theme "Planetary Systems of our 
Sun and other Stars, and the Future of Space Astronomy". It is open to 
participants from all regions, but scientists, young professionals and 
students in the Asian region are particularly encouraged to 
participate. The Symposium will feature plenary lectures as well as 
parallel and poster sessions.
 
A Capacity Building Workshop entitled "Atmospheric Correction of Earth 
Observation Data for Environmental Monitoring: Theory and Best 
Practices" will also take place in Bangkok at GISTDA the week before 
the Symposium from 4 to 8 November 2013 for which participants from 
the Asian region will be selected by application.

5TH WORKSHOP ON HYPERSPECTRAL IMAGE AND SIGNAL PROCESSING: EVOLUTION IN 
REMOTE SENSING (WHISPERS)

June 25-28, 2013
University of Florida 
Gainesville, Florida

We invite the planetary science community to join colleagues from the 
terrestrial remote sensing and signal processing communities. This 
year, we are proposing a special session devoted to techniques in 
planetary image processing with a data users workshop. The deadline for 
papers is soon (February 15). These are 4-pages, peer-reviewed prior to 
acceptance, and published in IEEE Transactions. It is the perfect venue 
for technically-focused advances. We hope you can join us in Florida. 
Please contact sylvain.doute@obs.ujf-grenoble.fr or ehlmann@caltech.edu 
for more information.

=article&id=211&Itemid=55

Imaging spectroscopy in the visible and infrared is a key remote 
sensing technique for exploring planetary objects in the Solar System. 
Since 1989, imaging spectrometers have operated at the Moon, Mars, 
Venus, Jupiter, Saturn, asteroids, and outer planet satellites. 
Continuing technological advances have generated improvements in 
dimensionality and precision. This special session welcomes all 
contributions that represent the state-of-the-art in hyperspectral 
imaging for planetary exploration: sensors (design, calibration), image 
processing (artifact reduction, atmospheric correction), photometry, 
physical modeling, spectral unmixing and endmember extraction, and 
applications (minerals, ices, aerosols, regolith properties, etc.).

PLANETARY ASTRONOMERS - NOTE NEW CATEGORIES IN HUBBLE PROPOSAL CALL

NASA and STScI are pleased to announce the Cycle 21 Call for Proposals 
for Hubble Space Telescope Observations and funding for Archival 
Research and Theoretical Research programs. Solar System astronomers 
may be interested to learn that Cycle 21 features a new category of 
medium proposals (35-74 orbits), and the threshold for Large programs 
has been dropped to >75 orbits. Over the past 20 cycles, Solar System 
science has been allocated ~5% of the total observing time, or over 
3200 orbits. However, only one large GO proposal for Solar System 
observations has been submitted since Servicing Mission 4; that 
proposal was awarded time in Cycle 17 (GO 11644). The planetary 
community is encouraged to take advantage of the new opportunities.

Further information about the Hubble Cycle 21 call is available
electronically from the STScI Announcement Web Page:

http://www.stsci.edu/hst/proposing/docs/cycle21announce

More information specifically for Solar System astronomers interested 
in Hubble can be found at in a presentation by John Clarke:

NASA PLANETARY SCIENCE SUMMER SCHOOL APPLICATIONS

NASA is accepting applications from science and engineering post-docs, 
recent PhDs, and doctoral students for its 25th Annual Planetary 
Science Summer School, which will hold two separate sessions this 
summer (July 29-August 2 and August 12-16) at the Jet Propulsion 
Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif. During the program and pre-session 
webinars, student teams will carry out the equivalent of an early 
mission concept study, prepare a proposal authorization review 
presentation, present it to a review board, and receive feedback. By 
the end of the session, students will have a clearer understanding of 
the life cycle of a space mission; relationships between mission 
design, cost, and schedule; and the tradeoffs necessary to stay within 
cost and schedule while preserving the quality of science. 
Applications are due April 5, 2013. Partial financial support is 
available for a limited number of individuals. Further information is 
available at:

STARDUST INTERSTELLAR DUST NOW AVAILABLE

The Stardust Curator announces the availability of samples from the 
Stardust Interstellar Dust Collector for general allocation to 
qualified Stardust Investigators. Samples from both the aerogel and 
aluminum foil collectors are available. Because these samples present 
unprecedented challenges in sample preparation and analysis, it is 
recommended that investigators thoroughly familiarize themselves with 
the collection before submitting a sample request. Preprints of the 
reports of the Stardust Interstellar Preliminary Examination (ISPE), 
currently in review at MAPS, are available to qualified Stardust 
Investigators on request from the Curator. Because interstellar dust 
particles in the collection appear to be extremely rare, extensive 
and rigorous demonstration of techniques using analogs will be a 
prerequisite for analyses of interstellar dust candidates.     

Sample requests, following the format outlined on the Stardust 
Curatorial website, may be submitted to:

ANNOUNCEMENT OF 2ND INTERNATIONAL OPPORTUNITY FOR JAXA HAYABUSA SAMPLES

JAXA has announced that they are now accepting proposals for HAYABUSA 
samples. The proposed investigation must address science questions that 
can be answered by analyzing the particles obtained from the surface of 
asteroid Itokawa. Participation is open to all researchers who have 
demonstrated the ability to usefully handle and analyze 20 to 50 
micrometer diameter particles. This 2nd International AO follows the 
Initial Analysis performed by preselected teams (partial results of 
which were published in Science magazine in August 2011) and the 1st 
International AO issued in January 2012. All proposals will be 
subjected to peer review handled by the Implementation Committee for 
the 2nd HAYABUSA AO. See the HAYABUSA Investigators Guidebook for more 
information. Proposals are due by 9 March 2013, 1500UT (2400JST:Japan 
Standard Time). Please see this website for complete information:

THE 2012 DRACONID STORM POTENTIALLY SAMPLED BY NASA ER-2 AIRCRAFT

NASA JSC's Cosmic Dust Collection Program has made special attempts to 
collect dust from particular meteor showers and asteroid families when 
flights can be planned well in advance, and very occasionally on short 
notice. Radar measurements obtained by the Canadian Meteor Orbit Radar 
during the 2012 Draconid shower indicated a meteor storm  occurred with 
a peak at Lo = 195.622 or 16:38 (±5 min) UT on Oct 8, 2012, of total 
duration ~2 hours (thank you Peter Brown). Draconids, originating from 
comet Giacobini-Zinner, have one of the slowest atmospheric entry 
velocities (23 km/s), and thus offer significant possibilities of 
successful dust capture in the stratosphere. Large and small area 
cosmic dust collectors (LACs and SACs) L2094, L2095, L2096, L2097, 
U2153 and U2154, were flown from October 15th to 17th, 2012 on NASA 
ER2 aircraft. Flight time accumulated by date was: Oct 15th - 7.8hrs, 
Oct 16th - 7.3hrs, Oct 17th - 8.1hrs. All collectors were received at 
JSC in late October 2012, particles are now being removed, and a subset 
is receiving routine preliminary characterization. These samples will 
be available for allocation to qualified investigators. More 
information go to:
