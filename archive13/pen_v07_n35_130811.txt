AGU SESSION P010 - FIRST RESULTS OF C/2012 S1 (ISON): COMET OF THE 
CENTURY?

Comet C/2102 S1, popularly known as C/ISON, is a sun-grazing comet, 
originating in the Oort cloud. It is predicted to be the brightest 
comet of the century and has captured the interest of global 
professional and amateur astronomers alike. On its initial passage 
through the inner solar system, C/ISON potentially can become a very 
bright daytime object as it approaches perihelion in November 2013.
Whether the comet lives up to the predictions or not, first results 
from various world-wide coordinated observing campaigns, including 
an armada of spacecraft, orbiting telescopes and ground-based 
professional and amateur facilities will be showcased.

NEW INTERPLANETARY DUST MISSION

We would like to inform you, that a proposal has been submitted to ESA 
with the title "Solar System Debris Disk - S2D2" in response to the 
call of ESA for mission themes for the next L2/L3 class mission. The 
mission proposes in-situ observations and sample return to probe the 
orbital and compositional connection between the dust in the inner 
interplanetary debris disk and its source bodies, mapping the sky in 
dust. This mission will provide a direct comparison of the composition 
of interstellar raw material with the more processed material from 
comets and asteroids. The full proposal can be seen at the S2D2 
webpage:

http://www.dsi.uni-stuttgart.de/cosmicdust/missions/
debrisdisk/index.html

We would like to broaden the community that is interested in this 
mission. To show your support, please, send an e-mail to 
debrisdisk@irs.uni-stuttgart.de with the subject "interest".

MARS CRITICAL DATA PRODUCTS PROGRAM (ROUND VIII) - COMET SIDING SPRING 
MODELING

The Mars Exploration Program has issued, in August 2013, a Request for 
Proposal for round VIII of the Mars Critical Data Products program.  
This RFP provides support of the modeling the dust and particle 
environment of Comet 2013 A1 (Siding Spring) during its encounter 
with Mars in October 2014. The intent is to provide data products 
useful for risk assessment and mitigation strategy development for 
the Mars orbiter missions, due to possible impacts from dust and ion 
tail particles as this comet encounters Mars. Proposals are due on 
Wednesday, September 11, 2013.

Details of the RFPs are posted at: 

https://acquisition.jpl.nasa.gov/RFP/MJ-2692-072413/default.htm 

or

NASA POSTDOCTORAL FELLOWSHIPS

The NASA Postdoctoral Program (NPP) provides opportunities for 
scientists and engineers to conduct research largely of their own 
choosing, yet compatible with the research opportunities posted on the 
NPP Web site.

Selected by a competitive peer-review process, NPP Fellows complete 
one- to three-year Fellowship appointments that advance NASA's 
missions in earth science, heliophysics, planetary science, 
astrophysics, space bioscience, aeronautics and engineering, human 
exploration and space operations, and astrobiology.

An example research opportunity is:

https://www3.orau.gov/NPDoc/Catalog/18360

Applicants must have a Ph.D. or equivalent degree in hand before 
beginning the fellowship, but may apply while completing the degree 
requirements. U. S. citizens, Lawful Permanent Residents, and foreign 
nationals eligible for J-1 status as a Research Scholar may apply.

Stipends start at $53,500 per year, with supplements for high cost-of-
living areas and for certain academic specialties. Financial assistance 
is available for relocation and health insurance, and $8,000 per year 
is provided for professional travel.

Applications are accepted three times each year: March 1, July 1, and 
November 1.

[NASA] NOTICE OF MARS 2020 SOLICITATION TO APPEAR IN SEPTEMBER

In late Sept we intend to release the Mars 2020 Announcement of 
Opportunity. Links to the AO and additional information about the 
intent and the capabilities of the Mars 2020 Rover, as well as the 
report of the Science Definition Team (SDT) and SDT FAQs will all be 
located at the Mars 2020 Acquisition Website:

http://soma.larc.nasa.gov/mars2020

Questions or comments about the planned solicitation may be sent to 
Dr. Mitchell D. Schulte at mars2020-ao@lists.nasa.gov by Friday August 
23rd in order to be considered for the final AO. The character string 
"Mars 2020 AO" must be included in the subject line of all 
communications.
