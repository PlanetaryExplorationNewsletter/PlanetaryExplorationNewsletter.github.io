JUPITER ENVIRONMENT TOOL (JET) AVAILABLE FOR MAGNETIC FIELD 
VISUALIZATION

The Jupiter Environment Tool (JET) is a custom user interface plugin 
for Systems Tool Kit (STK) developed at JPL that provides an interface 
to Jupiter environment models for visualization and analysis. Users 
can visualize the different magnetic field models of Jupiter through 
various rendering methods. These rendering methods are fully 
integrated within STK's 3D Window, allowing users to take snapshots and 
make animations of their scenarios with magnetic field visualizations. 
Analytical data can be accessed in the form of custom vectors. Given 
these customs vectors, users can have access to magnetic field data in 
custom reports, graphs, access constraints, coverage analysis, and 
anywhere else vectors are used within STK. For more information about 
the software and to request a copy, visit:

NASA POSTDOCTORAL FELLOWSHIPS

The NASA Postdoctoral Program (NPP) offers scientists and engineers 
unique opportunities to conduct research at NASA Centers. Each NPP 
fellowship opportunity is designed to advance NASA research in a 
specific project related to space science, earth science, aeronautics, 
exploration systems, lunar science, astrobiology, or astrophysics.

Applicants must have a Ph.D. or equivalent degree in hand before 
beginning the fellowship, but may apply while completing the degree 
requirements. U.S. citizens, Lawful Permanent Residents, and foreign 
nationals eligible for J-1 status as a Research Scholar may apply.

Stipends start at $53,500 per year, with supplements for high 
cost-of-living areas and for certain academic specialties. Financial 
assistance is available for relocation and health insurance, and 
$8,000 per year is provided for professional travel.

Applications are accepted three times each year: March 1, July 1, and 
November 1.

[NASA] PLANETARY PROTECTION SUBCOMMITTEE MEETING

The next meeting of the Planetary Protection Subcommittee will be held 
at NASA HQ on 29-30 April 2013. A focus of the meeting will be aspects 
of  Mars Sample Return. A discussion of planetary protection for human 
missions is also planned. The meeting is open to all (up to the 
capacity of the room). Locations and teleconference and WebEx 
information are below and on the agenda.

PLANETARY ATMOSPHERES RESEARCHER (GSFC/CRESST/UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND)

The NASA Goddard Space Flight Center's (GSFC) Planetary Environments
Laboratory, in conjunction with the Center for Research and Exploration 
in Space Science and Technology (CRESST), is soliciting applications 
for a researcher in the field of Planetary Atmospheres to support Mars 
upper atmosphere investigations with the MAVEN mission. Additional 
details are available at:  

http://www.astro.umd.edu/employment/

Candidates should have a Ph.D. in a relevant discipline with a strong 
and demonstrated interest in and understanding of upper atmospheric 
physics. IDL skills and experience in acquisition and analysis of data 
from space flight instruments are highly desirable.

The University of Maryland is an equal opportunity employer. All 
applications received by Monday, April 29, 2013 will receive full 
consideration.

[NASA] RELEASE AMENDMENT 10: INSTRUMENT TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPMENT IN 
SUPPORT OF THE EUROPA CLIPPER MISSION CONCEPT

NASA released a call for instrument technology development in support 
of the Europa Clipper mission concept entitled "Instrument Concepts for 
Europa Exploration (ICEE)". The goal is to mature and reduce the 
technical risk of instruments for the Europa Clipper mission to the 
point where they may be proposed in response to a possible future 
announcement of flight opportunity without additional extensive 
technology development. 

Notices of Intent are requested by May 13, 2013. Proposals are due
June 10, 2013.

The Europa Clipper strawman payload includes an Ice Penetrating Radar 
(IPR), a Shortwave Infrared Spectrometer (SWIRS), a Topographic Imager 
(TI), a mass spectrometer (MS), and a magnetometer. The IPR, SWIRS, TI, 
and MS have been identified as needing significant early development to 
enable them to operate in the Europan environment, and NASA plans to 
target those instruments with this funding opportunity. While other 
instruments may be proposed, selection preference will be given to 
proposed instruments in these four categories. 

Questions and comments should be addressed to:

EWASS 2013 SPECIAL SESSION SP11. ROCKS IN OUR SOLAR SYSTEM - BRIDGING 
THE GAP BETWEEN METEOR METEORITE AND ASTEROID STUDIES

The session will bring together scientists working on all aspects of 
Solar System rocky material properties. The topic includes laboratory 
analysis of meteorites and cosmic dust as well as observations and 
modeling of both meteoroids and asteroids. The contributions bridging 
the gap between properties of meteors, meteorites and asteroids are 
highly welcome. The session will also focus on recent Chelyabinsk 
fireball / meteorite fall event in order to put together knowledge 
acquired from studies of fireball trajectory, orbital analysis, and 
recovered meteorites.
