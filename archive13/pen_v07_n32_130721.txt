ANNOUNCEMENT OF YOSEMITE CHAPMAN CONFERENCE ON MAGNETOSPHERE-IONOSPHERE 
COUPLING IN THE SOLAR SYSTEM

February 9-14, 2014

Over the half century of exploration of the Earth's space environment, 
it has become evident that the interaction between the ionosphere and 
the magnetosphere plays a dominant role in the evolution and dynamics 
of magnetospheric plasmas and fields. It is now being found that this 
same interaction is of importance at other planets and moons 
throughout the solar system. This AGU Chapman conference will examine 
the details of the coupling processes using results from both 
measurements and modeling.

The main goal of this cross-discipline conference is to enhance the 
understanding of magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling processes by 
researchers in both the heliophysics and planetary science 
communities.  

The meeting is expected to have 75-85 attendees and will consist of 
invited and contributed papers as well as a poster session. Student 
attendance is encouraged. The Co-Conveners are Bob Schunk, Andy Nagy, 
Rick Chappell, Peter Banks, Jim Burch and Dan Baker. For further 
information about the conference go to the AGU Chapman Conference 
website:

GSA SESSION ON IMPACT CRATERS

We wanted to draw your attention to a session on impact cratering to
be held at the Geological >Society of America Meeting in Denver 
October 27-30.

All aspects of cratering are welcome!

Session T5. Impact Cratering in the Solar System: Fire to Ice-Vacuum 
to Atmospheres

This session focuses on the nature of impacts, with terrestrial
craters providing ground-truth for the interpretation of planetary
craters. Contributions regarding morphology, shock processes,
materials, modeling, impactor evolution, and airburst phenomena are
solicited. Comparisons of cratering among planets are encouraged.

AGU SESSION P031 - TITAN'S ENIGMATIC ATMOSPHERE AND IONOSPHERE

We are inviting you to submit an abstract to the above fall AGU 
session. We are convening this session to share relevant science 
results that have implications for Titan's stratosphere, thermosphere, 
ionosphere, and exosphere. We welcome submissions related to Cassini 
results, theoretical research, and laboratory studies. We look forward 
to hearing and sharing all of this wonderful Titan science. Below 
is the full abstract.

The processes that control Titan's atmosphere and ionosphere remain 
in many ways enigmatic even after nine years of observations and study 
from the Cassini mission and the Huygens probe. The instruments onboard 
Cassini-Huygens have studied in-situ and remotely many aspects of 
Titan's atmosphere and coupled ionosphere. In the stratosphere, 
thermosphere, ionosphere, and exosphere studies of atmospheric 
composition and structure have recently produced substantial 
breakthroughs in our understanding of this complex system. In this 
session, we focus on recent and ongoing studies of Titan's atmosphere 
and ionosphere. Papers focusing on atmospheric observations, modeling, 
and laboratory studies are welcomed.

AGU SESSION P033 - TRACKING DOWN LIFE: STAR BIOSIGNATURES, BIOMARKER 
SYSTEMS OR THE ENSEMBLE CAST?

Abstracts due August 6th

Please consider submitting an abstract to the "P033 Tracking Down 
Life: Star Biosignatures, Biomarker Systems or the Ensemble Cast?"
session at the AGU 2013 Fall Meeting, San Francisco, 9-12 December.

The session is a really comprehensive one about biosignatures and 
we have managed to persuade a stellar slate of Invited Abstracts 
from (in alphabetical order) Dave DesMarais, Danny Glavin, Chris 
McKay and Everett Shock who variously will give papers on 
biosignature-related topics (in alphabetical order) Instruments, 
Outer planets, Planetary analogs and Terrestrial planets.  
 
Star quality biosignatures are unambiguous: preserved biomolecules, 
not possibly formed abiotically, but are hard to preserve. Mineral 
biosignatures (MBs), fossil inorganic metabolites, are robust but 
can be formed inorganically. But new analysis techniques can 
tackle preservation and origins. Systematic searches for signs 
of life should include all options. MBs may have biochemicals 
in them & so act as beacons or pathfinders to fossil ecosystems. 
We seek abstracts on planetary analogs; ancient Earth; organic 
gaseous and mineral biosigs; biomarker systems - including 
non-Earth-centric; instruments; quantifying biosig distribution 
& chance of preservation; etc. We want a spectrum - stars, 
supporting actors or the ensemble.

WILLIAM K. HARTMANN RECEIVES 2013 SHOEMAKER DISTINGUISHED LUNAR 
SCIENTIST AWARD

William K. Hartmann, Senior Scientist and co-founder of the Planetary 
Science Institute, was presented with the annual Shoemaker 
Distinguished Lunar Scientist Award at the 2013 virtual Lunar Science 
Forum, held July 16-18, 2013 from NASA Ames Research Center. The 
Shoemaker Medal is a career award given to scientists who have 
significantly contributed to the field of lunar science.

Dr. Hartmann is an internationally known scientist, painter, and 
writer, and winner of the first Carl Sagan Medal from the American 
Astronomical Society. A former graduate student of Gerard Kuiper, 
he holds a Ph.D. in Astronomy and M.S. in Geology, and a B.S. in 
Physics. Bill discovered multi-ring impact basins with concentric 
and radial structure on the Moon, including Orientale basin on the 
east limb of the Moon. In 1965 he used crater counts on the Moon and 
Earth to successfully predict the age of lunar lava plains at 3.6 x 
10^9 years; the date was confirmed five years later with Apollo 
samples from the Moon. He was also lead author of the most widely 
accepted theory of the origin of the moon, by impact of giant 
planetesimal at the end of the planet-forming era.

HAYABUSA 2013: SYMPOSIUM OF SOLAR SYSTEM MATERIALS

Dear Colleagues,

Date: 16-18 Oct., 2013
Place: Sagamihara Campus of JAXA, Sagamihara, Kanagawa, JAPAN
Point of Contact: hayabusa-symp2013@planeta.sci.isas.jaxa.jp

Since the return of samples from Itokawa by Hayabusa in 2010, the  
initial analyses followed by studies selected in the 1st International  
AO have been performed. Now is the right time to review these results  
as a whole. Furthermore, multiple asteroid sample return missions are 
in progress, and the analysis of returned samples has become one of  
the key components of planetary science. Now is the right time to set 
a perspective on the driving force that returned samples will give to 
the future of solar system science. It is in this spirit that the 
workshop "Hayabusa 2013: Symposium of Solar System Materials" is 
designed.

We especially welcome presentations on the following topics:
- Hayabusa sample analysis results
- Solar system science via sample return missions
- New techniques in solar system sample analysis
- New ideas on the origin and evolution of the solar system

There will be no registration fee for this workshop. Please visit

http://hayabusaao.isas.jaxa.jp/symposium/index.html

for more details. Online abstract submission is already available at 
the web-site.
