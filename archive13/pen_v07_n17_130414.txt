EDITORIAL - WHO IS MINDING PLANETARY RESEARCH?

On April 4, NASA Planetary Science Division Director Jim Green 
addressed the Planetary Science Subcommittee about sequestration and
rescission. I noted two statements repeatedly made: he did not see
planetary research programs maintaining their budgets under rescission, 
and $75M added by Congress for Europa in FY13 is "the law!" 

House Appropriations staff say rescissions are to be applied "across 
the board," constrained by NASA Administrative Provisions in the FY13 
budget bill. A simple calculation: The annual PSD budget for the first 
half of FY13 was $1.19B. Congress increased this to $1.415B for the 
full year. To get back below $1.19B, possibly impacting research, 
requires rescission >35%! This does not seem likely.

$75M represents ~50% of the total budget for annually competed 
planetary research programs in ROSES. Some core planetary research 
programs still suffer from record low selection rates (primarily due to 
unexplained budget cuts, not proposal pressure) and long delays in 
awards.

The Administration and both houses of Congress openly support the 
planetary research programs, as demonstrated by proposed and 
appropriated budgets. It is PSD management that undermines their 
intent.  

Stop treating planetary research as a slush fund.

NASA LUNAR SCIENCE FORUM 2013 (LSF2013): SECOND ANNOUNCEMENT

***IMPORTANT CHANGE***

LSF2013 will be a VIRTUAL conference with NO "in-person" component this 
year!

Due to the recent government restrictions on travel, The NASA Lunar 
Science Institute will broadcast the annual NASA Lunar Science Forum 
(LSF) as a virtual conference the week of July 15-19, 2013. The 
conference will be broadcast between the hours of 9 a.m. - 3 p.m. PDT, 
Monday-Friday, to accommodate a wide spread in time zones.

The scientific program will feature sessions on in-depth scientific 
results from the recent and pending missions, including: the Gravity 
Recovery And Interior Laboratory (GRAIL), Acceleration, Reconnection, 
Turbulence and Electrodynamics of the Moon's Interaction with the Sun 
(ARTEMIS), and Lunar Atmosphere and Dust Environment Explorer (LADEE) 
missions.  This year's conference will have unique features enabled by 
virtual technology that will be described in later notices, along with 
features of the LSF the community has appreciated in the past: the 
annual Shoemaker Award Lecture (winner to be announced at the meeting), 
the NASA Townhall, a virtual poster session, a virtual LunarGradCon 
(for graduate students). 

Abstracts deadline: Midnight PDT April 26, 2013

logistics, please visit:

NASA POSTDOCTORAL FELLOWSHIPS

The NASA Postdoctoral Program (NPP) offers scientists and engineers 
unique opportunities to conduct research at NASA Centers. Each NPP 
fellowship opportunity is designed to advance NASA research in a 
specific project related to space science, earth science, aeronautics, 
exploration systems, lunar science, astrobiology, or astrophysics.

Applicants must have a Ph.D. or equivalent degree in hand before 
beginning the fellowship, but may apply while completing the degree 
requirements. U. S. citizens, Lawful Permanent Residents, and foreign 
nationals eligible for J-1 status as a Research Scholar may apply.

Stipends start at $53,500 per year, with supplements for high 
cost-of-living areas and for certain academic specialties. Financial 
assistance is available for relocation and health insurance, and 
$8,000 per year is provided for professional travel.

Applications are accepted three times each year: March 1, July 1, and 
November 1.

[NASA] INTENT TO RELEASE SOLICITATION ON INSTRUMENT TECHNOLOGY 
DEVELOPMENT IN SUPPORT OF THE EUROPA CLIPPER MISSION CONCEPT

NASA intends to release a call for instrument technology development 
in support of the Europa Clipper mission concept entitled "Instrument 
Concepts for Europa Exploration (ICEE)". The goal is to mature and 
reduce the technical risk of instruments for the Europa Clipper mission 
to the point where they may be proposed in response to a possible 
future announcement of flight opportunity without additional extensive 
technology development. 

NASA plans to release the NRA no later than April 30; we anticipate 
that proposals will be due 45 days later.

The Europa Clipper strawman payload includes an Ice Penetrating Radar 
(IPR), a Shortwave Infrared Spectrometer (SWIRS), a Topographic Imager 
(TI), a mass spectrometer (MS), and a magnetometer. The IPR, SWIRS, TI, 
and MS have been identified as needing significant early development to 
enable them to operate in the Europan environment, and NASA plans to 
target those instruments with this funding opportunity. While other 
instruments may be proposed, selection preference will be given to 
proposed instruments in these four categories.

[NASA] PLANETARY INSTRUMENT CONCEPTS FOR THE ADVANCEMENT OF SOLAR
SYSTEM OBSERVATIONS

Planetary Instrument Concepts for the Advancement of Solar System 
Observations (PICASSO) program supports the development of 
spacecraft-based instrument systems that show promise for use in future
planetary missions. The goal of the program is to conduct planetary and 
astrobiology science instrument feasibility studies, concept formation, 
proof of concept instruments, and advanced component technology 
development to the point where they may be proposed in response to 
Appendix C.19 of ROSES. Therefore, the proposed instrument system or 
advanced components must address specific scientific objectives of 
likely future planetary science missions. The objective of the program 
is to develop new technologies that significantly improve instrument 
measurement capabilities for planetary science missions (such as 
Discovery, New Frontiers, Mars Exploration, and other planetary 
programs).

Notices of Intent deadline: July 19, 2013
Proposals deadline: September 13, 2013.

PLANETARY ATMOSPHERES RESEARCHER (GSFC/CRESST/UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND)

The NASA Goddard Space Flight Center's (GSFC) Planetary Environments
Laboratory, in conjunction with the Center for Research and Exploration 
in Space Science and Technology (CRESST), is soliciting applications 
for a researcher in the field of Planetary Atmospheres to support Mars 
upper atmosphere investigations with the MAVEN mission. Additional 
details are available at:  

http://www.astro.umd.edu/employment/

Candidates should have a Ph.D. in a relevant discipline with a strong 
and demonstrated interest in and understanding of upper atmospheric 
physics. IDL skills and experience in acquisition and analysis of data 
from space flight instruments are highly desirable.

The University of Maryland is an equal opportunity employer. All 
applications received by Monday, April 29, 2013 will receive full 
consideration.

DYNAMIC MARS FROM LONG-TERM OBSERVATIONS

We are well into the 2nd decade of continuous Mars observations that 
began with MGS and continued with ODY, MEX, and MRO. Bridged to earlier 
times by spacecraft observations from the 1960s onwards, and a 
continuous telescopic campaign, our view of Mars is now one of a 
planet on which surface and atmospheric changes occur at frequencies of 
days, years, and decades, a testament to long-term monitoring that 
continues to this day. At this time, it is appropriate that this 
record, with implications for Martian geology, climate, atmospheric 
dynamics, and other processes, be integrated into a journal special 
section, published in either Icarus or JGR-Planets by January 2014.  

To support a proposal to publication journal, please submit paper 
titles, author lists, and interest/commitment level (definite, likely, 
possible) for papers that:

* Include surface, sub-surface, and atmosphere observations, or 
model results, that are new and a unique outcome of the long-term 
data acquisition provided by Mars spacecraft and telescopes

* Highlight the long-term implications of processes that are observed 
and ongoing now

* Are not reviews of previous work, unless new conclusions are drawn

By April 19, please send information to:

THE PLUTO SYSTEM ON THE EVE OF EXPLORATION BY NEW HORIZONS: 
PERSPECTIVES AND PREDICTIONS - ABSTRACTS DUE MONDAY

The April 15 deadline for abstracts to the conference, "The Pluto 
System on the Eve of Exploration by New Horizons: Perspectives 
and Predictions," is tomorrow. 

The conference will be held 22-26 July at The Johns Hopkins University 
Applied Physics Laboratory in Laurel, Maryland, USA. A special issue 
of Icarus is planned to publish new results and prediction papers in 
advance of the New Horizons flyby.

Both registration and abstract submission are available for the Pluto 
2013 conference at:  

http://plutoscience.jhuapl.edu 

Abstracts are solicited on all facets of the Pluto system - including 
origins, interiors, surfaces, compositions, atmospheres, satellites, 
plasma, and context in the Kuiper Belt.
