=init&solId={22395A3D-DA0E-BB95-4C82-2C50ECD97E08}&path=open

"The goal of the Night Rover Challenge is to stimulate innovations in 
energy storage technologies of value in extreme space environments, 
such as the surface of the moon, or for electric vehicles and renewable 
energy systems here on Earth," said Michael Gazarik, NASA's associate 
administrator for Space Technology. "NASA wants this challenge to
generate new ideas that will allow planetary rovers the ability to take 
on a night shift, and possibly create new energy storage technologies 
for applications of benefit here on our home planet."

The Night Rover Challenge is part of the Centennial Challenges Program 
within NASA's Space Technology Mission Directorate, which is 
innovating, developing, testing and flying hardware for use in NASA's 
future missions. For more information about NASA's investment in space

NEW HORIZONS ENCOUNTER HAZARD UPDATE

Alan Stern (SwRI) & Hal Weaver (JHU/APL)

The New Horizons Project recently completed a 1.5-year study of the 
potential dust impact hazard from small-satellite-generated debris as 
the spacecraft flies through the Pluto system in July 2015. 

This study concluded that the probability of a mission-ending dust 
impact is <0.3% if the spacecraft follows the current baseline plan, 
far below some early, more conservative estimates. Thus, the 
expectation is that the NH spacecraft will follow this baseline plan, 
with a close approach of ~12,500 km from the surface of Pluto.

However, two alternative plans (called SHBOTs, for Safe Haven By 
Other Trajectories) are also being developed to mitigate the 
(unlikely) possibility that new knowledge indicates the hazard risk 
is greater than predicted. For both SHBOTs, the spacecraft will be 
turned so the antenna faces the incoming dust particles 
("Antenna-To-Ram", or ATR) during the few hours of greatest risk, but 
Generic Inner SHBOT (GIS) has essentially the same trajectory as the 
current baseline, while Deep Inner SHBOT (DIS) diverts the trajectory 
to within ~3000 km of Pluto's surface, where atmospheric drag removes 
dust on very short timescales.

ICARUS SPECIAL ISSUE: DYNAMIC MARS FROM LONG-TERM OBSERVATIONS

We are well into the 2nd decade of continuous Mars observations that 
began with MGS and have continued with ODY, MEX, MRO, and our landed 
spacecraft. Bridged to earlier times by spacecraft observations from 
the 1960s onwards, and a continuous telescopic campaign, our view of 
Mars is now one of a planet on which surface and atmospheric changes 
occur at frequencies of days, years, and decades, a testament to 
long-term monitoring that continues to this day. At this time, it is 
appropriate that this record, with implications for Martian geology, 
climate, atmospheric dynamics, and other processes, be integrated into 
a journal special section, submitted to Icarus by November 15, 2013.

This special issue is for for papers that: 

-Include surface, sub-surface, and atmosphere observations, or model 
 results, that are new and a unique outcome of the long-term data 
 acquisition provided by Mars spacecraft and telescopes
-Highlight the long-term implications of processes that are observed 
 and ongoing now
-Are not reviews of previous work, unless new conclusions are drawn

ANNOUNCEMENT OF OPPORTUNITY TO SUBMIT INPUT TO STUDY ON HUMAN 
SPACEFLIGHT

The NRC's Committee on Human Spaceflight is conducting a 
congressionally-requested study to examine the goals, core 
capabilities, and direction of human space flight. This study will 
provide findings and recommendations to guide the U.S. human 
spaceflight enterprise in a sustainable manner. One important source 
of input is this call for short papers from communities around the 
world with an interest in human spaceflight.

These papers should consider:

1. What are the important benefits provided to the United States and 
   other countries by human spaceflight endeavors?

2. What are the greatest challenges to sustaining a U.S. government 
   program in human spaceflight?

3. What are the ramifications and what would the nation and world lose 
   if the United States terminated NASA's human spaceflight program?

In discussing the above questions, respondents are asked to describe 
the reasoning that supports their arguments and, to the extent 
possible, include or cite any evidence that supports their views. In
considering #1 above, submitters may consider private as well as 
government space programs.

STUDENT OPPORTUNITY - SUDBURY FIELD CAMP

The Short Course and Field School at the Sudbury Impact Structure is a 
week-long classroom and field training program based in Sudbury, 
Ontario. The goal of the program will be to introduce students to 
impact cratering processes and observe, in the field, the attributes 
of an immense basin-size impact structure. Sudbury is known for 
spectacular shatter cones, tremendously thick melt-bearing impact 
breccias (the Onaping Formation), and a differentiated impact melt 
sheet (the Sudbury Igneous Complex). Skills developed during the 
program should better prepare students for their own thesis studies in 
impact cratered terrains, whether they be on Earth, the Moon, Mars, 
or some other solar system planetary surface. This field camp is being 
organized under the auspices of the NASA Lunar Science Institute, 
which is designed, in part, to train a new generation of explorers 
for the Moon and beyond. The activity is being led the Canadian 
Lunar Research Network and the LPI-JSC Center for Lunar Science 
and Exploration.

Course details are available in our syllabus.

Please pass this information on to any students who might be 
interested.
