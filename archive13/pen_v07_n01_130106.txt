BERTRAM DONN (1919-2012)

Dr. Bertram "Bert" Donn, the first head of NASA Goddard's astro-
chemistry group, passed away on Friday December 28, 2012 at age 93. 
Bert, a New Yorker by birth, attended Harvard University, where he was 
taught by such legends as Fred Whipple, Cecilia Payne, and Bart Bok. A 
meeting with Harold Urey in the 1950s turned Bert's attention to 
problems of low-temperature reactions and their connections to inter-
stellar chemistry. Bert's research at Goddard spanned theory, 
observation, and experiment, with connections to NASA missions such as 
Skylab, Apollo, and the International Ultraviolet Explorer. Almost all 
of his research concerned cometary and interstellar matter in some way. 
Bert also was an early NASA contributor to the astrobiological 
literature, and initiated several astrobiology-related research 
projects at Goddard. He was a pioneer in astrochemistry and NASA 
research. He did much to establish NASA's strong scientific reputation 
among astronomers and planetary scientists around the world. Aside from 
his Goddard work, Bert was a well-known and honored advocate of non-
violence and peaceful conflict resolution, and was instrumental in the 
racial integration of Greenbelt, where he and his family lived for 50 
years. For more information please see:

[NASA] RETIREMENT LETTER FROM DOUG MCCUISTON

To the Mars Exploration Community,
 
As I depart from the Program and NASA, after more than 20 years with 
Agency and nearly 9 years leading the Mars Exploration Program, I want 
to thank and congratulate you all on what we have accomplished. As I 
look back it has truly been a remarkable decade of achievements, 
advancements, discovery, community convergence, and world-wide 
notoriety. From engineer to scientist to manager, we pulled together 
through some tough times, kept the program, missions and research on 
track, replanned as challenges were thrown our way, capitalized on the 
incredible successes of Odyssey, Spirit & Opportunity, MRO, Phoenix, 
and of course MSL/Curiosity. We have changed science and changed the 
text books! This community has shown incredible poise, resilience, 
selflessness and togetherness, and incredible foresight. You have 
had the vision to look past challenging times and create a bright 
future for Mars and solar system exploration. Our recent 
accomplishments with Curiosity have brought Mars and solar system
exploration into many people’s daily lives for the first time, and we 
have touched the world with this incredible feat—and there’s more to 
come! The adventure is just beginning!
  
While timing a retirement is always challenging, I leave encouraged and 
content—Curiosity safely on the surface doing incredible science 
(landing in a stream bed—what a start!), and a secure future for the 
Mars Exploration Program with a 2020 science rover mission after MAVEN 
and an ExoMars cooperation. In the interim, the Program is in good 
hands with Michael Meyer and Jim Green (acting Program Director). The 
Agency is well aware of the importance of Mars and will be actively 
pursuing a replacement.
 
I have been honored to work with, and lead, such an extraordinary and 
innovative community. My years working with you, and our 
accomplishments, are without doubt the highlight of my career! Keep 
moving forward, keep innovating, keep discovering! 
 
On to Mars…
Doug

CALL FOR ABSTRACTS - 64TH INTERNATIONAL ASTRONAUTICAL CONGRESS

The International Astronautical Congress (IAC) is the largest space-
related conference worldwide and selects an average of 1000 scientific 
papers every year. The IAC is organized by the International 
Astronautical Federation (IAF), the International Academy of 
Astronautics (IAA), and the International Institute of Space Law 
(IISL). 
 
In 2013, the IAC will be held in Beijing, China, September 23-27. The 
IAC has posted a "Call for Abstracts," with a submission deadline of 
February 21, 2013. NASA plans to also announce a "Call for Abstracts" 
inviting graduate students to submit abstracts (of no more than 400 
words) to participate in the 64th International Astronautical Congress.  
Abstracts must be submitted to NASA and to the IAF. Details on the 
NASA Call for Abstracts will be distributed by mid-January, with the 
same submission deadline of February 21, 2013. The selected NASA 
sponsored students must also be selected by the IAF. 
 
For additional information about the Congress and to obtain information

mission managers who will be carrying out and leading the next human 
missions to explore space, and we want your input.

We invite you to share your ideas with space leaders in government, 
industry and academia at the International Astronautical Congress in 
Beijing, China, 23-27 September 2013!

PLANETARY SCIENCE SLIDES AND ILLUSTRATIONS

Are you looking for some great slides or illustrations to use in your 
classes this term? The Planetary Science Research Discoveries website 
has sets of Powerpoint slides. These are summaries of PSRD articles 
covering the origin of solar systems and the processes by which 
planets, moons, and small bodies form and evolve. The slides are 
annotated with captions and notes, and are linked to PSRD articles 
that provide the full context, additional graphics, and references.

http://www.psrd.hawaii.edu/Archive/Archive-PSRDpresents.html

The Cosmochemistry Illustrated website offers Powerpoint slides with 
planetary examples to enrich any geochemistry, petrology, and 
introductory geology course. References and background are given in the 
notes pages.

NEIL ARMSTRONG DIDN'T LIE ABOUT HIS "ONE SMALL STEP" QUOTE

Dear Friends and Colleagues,

I was distressed to see recent news stories claiming that Neil 
Armstrong lied to the world about when he made up his famous "One small 
step for a man, one giant leap for mankind" quote. I have written an 
op-ed in response, which is now available on Space.com: 

http://www.space.com/19136-neil-armstrong-moon-speech-truth.html

I would appreciate it if you would spread this far and wide, to 
counteract the ridiculous statements that have been made in past days. 
Feel free to send it to any publications you may have contact with.

Thanks,
Andy Chaikin
