INTERNATIONAL METEOR CONFERENCE 2012 AUGUST 22-25, POZNAŃ, POLAND

The 2013 International Meteor Conference will be held in Poznań, the
capital of western Poland. The conference will be organized by the 
Polish Comets and Meteors Workshop (CMW/PKiM). This IMC will be closely 
connected with Meteoroids 2013 Conference to be held a few days later 
in the same city. Such location of the IMC will help both amateurs and 
professionals to meet and exchange their scientific results.

During the weekend the IMC participants will visit the Morasko 
Reservoir - a group of the large meteorite impact craters located north 
of Poznań and the meteorites exhibition with largest, 262-kg piece of 
Morasko meteorite, found in 2012.

POSTDOCTORAL RESEARCHER IN PLANETARY MAPPING AND IMPACT STUDIES: LUNAR 
AND PLANETARY INSTITUTE

Universities Space Research Association (USRA) invites applications for 
a postdoctoral fellowship in planetary science in Houston, Texas. The 
candidate will work with Dr. Paul Schenk, investigating the impact 
crater shapes and distributions on icy satellites, including Enceladus, 
using the entire Cassini image library, and supplementary stereo and 
shape-from-shading techniques (although experience in these tools is 
not required). The candidate will also be expected to develop their 
own research projects using this data.

Candidate must have a recent Ph.D. in geology or geophysics and have a 
strong background in remote sensing/image processing of spacecraft 
data, and preferably experience in geophysical or mapping 
investigations. The position is generally for two years, with a 
possible extension to three years.  Apply to the posting at: 

https://usracareers.silkroad.com/ 

Include a letter of interest, a curriculum vita with a list of 
publications, a brief statement of research interests, and a list of 
three references. Review of candidates begins August 1, 2013, with a 
hiring decision, as soon as possible thereafter. Information on 
current research and facilities at the LPI is found on our website 
(www.lpi.usra.edu).

The Universities Space Research Association is an Equal Opportunity 
Employer.

POSTDOC AVAILABLE FOR RESEARCHING PLUTO'S EXTENDED ATMOSPHERE

The University of Texas Center for Aeromechanics Research has a 
postdoctoral research position available to develop a three dimensional 
DSMC simulation of Pluto's extended atmosphere in anticipation of the 
New Horizons arrival.

A researcher in the field of planetary atmospheres with a background 
in programming and outer solar system physics is desired. Knowledge of 
the direct simulation Monte Carlo method or related stochastic 
modeling would be very helpful.

Candidates should have a PhD in a relevant discipline and a strong 
interest in upper atmospheric physics. Position is available 
immediately.

Initial appointment is for one year but is renewable for an additional 
year. To apply, please contact Prof. David Goldstein at 
david(at)ices.utexas.edu.

ANALOG SITES FOR MARS MISSIONS II: PAST, PRESENT AND FUTURE MISSIONS 
TO MARS

We would like to invite the planetary community to participate in a 
two-part discussion of terrestrial analog sites for future Mars 
research. In Part 1, we are currently conducting an online discussion 
forum:

http://planetsonearth.com/forums/general-discussion

to (i) discuss outstanding Mars science questions that might be 
answered through previous, ongoing, or future missions, including the 
2020 rover mission, (ii) tackle how these questions could be addressed 
with analog research on Earth, (iii) summarize the topics discussed 
and identify science objectives to be addressed through abstracts for 
the following analog research workshop. We have discussion leaders, 
including Lisa Pratt, Kris Zacny and Steve Squyres, who will be 
available for an hour or two to answer questions and participate in 
the discussion regarding specific topics on certain days. It is also 
possible to post your comments and questions anytime as long as the 
forum is open. The workshop, Part 2, will continue the discussion with 
in-person presentations and breakout sessions. The workshop will be 
held on August 5th-7th at the Carnegie Institution of Washington in 
Washington, DC. For more information visit:

OUTER PLANETS ASSESSMENT GROUP (OPAG) MEETING IN JULY

The next OPAG meeting will be held in the Washington DC area July 15 - 
16. Monday, July 15, will be a full-day meeting, focused primarily on 
where things stand currently with respect to outer planet missions, 
R&A, and technology development. The budget will be a major topic. 
Tuesday, July 16, will be a half-day meeting to discuss how OPAG can 
be best prepared (organizationally, documents, workshops, etc.) to 
advocate for outer planet science. Tuesday afternoon will be free, 
allowing attendees to take advantage of the opportunity to schedule 
visits with their congressional representatives if they so choose.

GSA 2013 OUTER SOLAR SYSTEM SATELLITES COMPANION SESSIONS
 
We call to your attention two companion planetary science sessions at 
the annual Geological Society of America meeting held Oct 27-30 in 
Denver, CO focusing on studies related to the outer solar system 
satellites.
 
T9: "Outer Satellite Exploration: The Next 50 Years". This session 
will discuss current paradigms and unanswered fundamental questions 
about outer planet satellites that will be important considerations 
in future outer solar system exploration, and mission and instrument 
concepts that address them.
 
T12: "Voyager to New Horizons: Exploring Surface and Interior 
Processes of Icy Worlds". This session will highlight surface and 
tectonic processes, interiors, and the thermal evolution of icy 
satellites, KBOs, and planetary analogs. We encourage experimental 
and theoretical modeling studies, as well as observational approaches 
to address current scientific objectives.
 
Additional information about the GSA meeting can be found at:

NASA POSTDOCTORAL FELLOWSHIPS

The NASA Postdoctoral Program (NPP) provides opportunities to 
scientists and engineers to conduct research largely of their own 
choosing, yet compatible with the research opportunities posted on 
the NPP Web site.  An example of one of the research opportunities in 
planetary science is: 

https://www3.orau.gov/NPDoc/Catalog/18212
 
Selected by a competitive peer-review process, NPP Fellows complete 
one- to three-year Fellowship appointments that advance NASA’s missions 
in earth science, heliophysics, planetary science, astrophysics, space 
bioscience, aeronautics and engineering, human exploration and space 
operations, and astrobiology.
 
Applicants must have a Ph.D. or equivalent degree in hand before
