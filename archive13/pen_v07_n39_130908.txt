IN MEMORIAM: BISHUN N. KHARE (1933-2013)

Our colleague and friend Bishun Khare died quietly on August 20 at the 
age of 80. Bishun is widely known for his early work on organic solid 
residues (tholins) related to the aerosols in planetary atmospheres and 
the interstellar medium, performed for many years at Cornell University 
in collaboration with Carl Sagan. Their 1984 paper gave the optical 
constants of Titan tholin from the X-ray to microwave region, and has 
served as a fundamental input to modeling work that included planetary 
surfaces in addition to atmospheric aerosols. That key paper has 
received well over 300 citations, and has stimulated much additional 
research on tholins, both in the US and in Europe. In 1996, Bishun 
moved from Cornell to NASA Ames Research Center on a Senior National 
Research Council fellowship, and subsequently joined the SETI 
Institute. He continued his research on many topics in his Ames lab, 
and mentored a great number of students, including supervising the 
thesis work of graduate students. Bishun was a patient, kind, and 
sharing individual, who loved to talk about science, especially the 
organic materials in Nature and those he could synthesize in his lab.

Composed by D. Cruikshank.

IN MEMORIAM: BRUCE MURRAY (1931-2013)

Bruce Murray, former JPL Director, co-founder of the Planetary Society, 
and Caltech Emeritus Professor passed away on August 29. In the words 
of JPL's Director Charles Elachi, "Bruce was JPL's fifth Director, 
serving from 1976 to 1982, but his association with JPL goes back much 
further. He was a Caltech geologist and a key member of the Mariner 4 
Imaging team that captured the first close up image of Mars in 1964. 
It was only the first of four planetary missions in which he played a 
vital role as a scientist. Shortly after Bruce became Director, JPL was 
the scene for mission operations for the landings of Viking 1 and 2 on 
Mars. The following year Voyager 1 and 2 were launched, and Bruce led 
the lab through the Voyagers' encounters at Jupiter and Saturn. He 
worked tirelessly to save our nation's planetary exploration capability 
at a tumultuous time when there was serious talk of curtailing future 
missions. Along with Carl Sagan and Lou Friedman, he founded The 
Planetary Society. Long after returning to Caltech as a professor, he 
continued to be a strong voice in expressing the importance of space 
exploration."

[NASA] PDS ANNOUNCES DAWN'S FRAMING CAMERA DATA FOR VESTA NOW 
ACCESSIBLE ON THE SMALL BODIES IMAGE BROWSER 

The Asteroid Subnode of the Planetary Data System is pleased to 
announce the release of the Dawn missions Framing Camera's data into 
the Small Bodies Image Browser (SBIB):

http://sbib.psi.edu

The SBIB tool is designed to provide direct access to the image data 
maintained at the Small Bodies Asteroid subnode. One can click on the 
overview map (or click and drag a search box) and do a search for all 
images that fall within that region. The SBIB will provide a list of 
images, their footprints on the overview map, and thumbnails that can 
be either as viewed by the spacecraft or map-projected. Level 1A and 1B
are available in IMG (native format), FITS, JPEG, PNG and ISIS cubes 
(both basic cubes and map projected cubes with coordinates).

The data currently in the system are all of the framing camera images 
of Vesta from Survey through the 2nd High Altitude Mapping Orbit 
(HAMO 2). The data have been accepted by the PDS in time for the 
upcoming Planetary Mission Data Analysis Program deadline.

SPECIAL ISSUE OF ICARUS: MSL 1ST YEAR RESULTS

The Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) Curiosity rover has completed its 
first Earth year of operations, revealing a diversity of rock and soil 
types, including an ancient streambed, unusual igneous rocks, 
mudstones, mineral veins, and hydrated surface and subsurface 
materials. The elemental composition and mineralogy of the first 
drilled samples suggest conditions that could have been capable of 
supporting life. Now that initial operations and testing of the 
rover capabilities have been completed in the Yellowknife Bay area, 
the rover has begun its traverse towards the entrance to Mt. Sharp. 
As such, it is timely to coordinate results from MSL's first year of 
operations into a journal special issue, submitted to Icarus by 
October 1, 2013.  

This special issue is for papers that:

- Include observations and analyses of MSL data related to atmospheric 
science, geologic and geomorphologic studies, surface properties, 
radiation environment, and mineralogy and geochemistry of the surface 
and subsurface materials analyzed by Curiosity
- Incorporate additional orbital data sets of the Curiosity landing 
site region

[NASA] PLANETARY PROTECTION REMOVED FROM ROSES 2013

When the ROSES-2013 omnibus solicitation was released in February, 
Appendix C.18, the Planetary Protection Research Program (PPRP) due 
dates were listed as "TBD." We regret to inform proposers that PPRP 
will not be solicited in ROSES-13. The impacts of sequestration in the 
current fiscal year and lowered future planning budgets don't leave 
enough funds to support both existing and future investigations in 
FY 2014. Appendix C.18 will appear in Tables two and three of ROSES-13 
as "Not solicited this year." Questions concerning Appendix C.18, the 
Planetary Protection Research Program, may be directed to Cassie Conley 
at cassie.conley@nasa.gov. This and all Amendments to ROSES 12 can be

PLANETARY SCIENCE: PROGRESS WITH SUBORBITAL REUSABLE LAUNCH VEHICLES 
(SRLV)

Sunday, October 6, 2013 
2:00 PM - 5:00 PM 
Director's Row I 
Sheraton Denver Downtown Hotel

Suborbital Reusable Launch Vehicles (sRLV), ranging from balloons to 
spacecraft, provide new, cost-effective platforms for planetary science 
observations and experiments. From the on-going BRISSON campaign to 
observe comet ISON to contained simulations of planetary formation 
processes in zero-G, planetary scientists are now utilizing these 
vehicles in their research. The modest costs and development times for 
suborbital missions provide excellent training opportunities for future 
spacecraft mission PIs and developers of spacecraft instruments. 
Suborbital platforms offer advantages for increasing technology 
readiness level for flight experiments at a fraction of the cost of 
traditional orbital platforms. This second DPS workshop updates the 
use of rSLVs for instrumentation, spacecraft and mission design to 
address and answer planetary science questions. Composed of talks and 
open discussion, this workshop will present science results and lessons 
learned from planetary scientists engaged in research and suborbital 
spacecraft industries.

"FUNDAMENTAL PLANETARY SCIENCE" BY JACK J. LISSAUER AND IMKE DE PATER

Cambridge University Press is pleased to announce the publication of 
an engaging new textbook for advanced undergraduate students, which 
explains the wide variety of physical, chemical and geological 
processes that govern the motions and properties of planets. Building 
on the success of their award-winning graduate textbook, the authors 
provide an overview of our current knowledge and discuss some of the 
unanswered questions at the forefront of research in planetary science 
and astrobiology today. They combine knowledge of the Solar System and 
the properties of extrasolar planets with astrophysical observations 
of ongoing star and planet formation, offering a comprehensive model 
for understanding the origin of planetary systems. With more than 200 
exercises to help students learn how to apply the concepts covered, 
this textbook is ideal for a one-semester or two-quarter course for 
undergraduate students.

NEW BOOK ON PLANETARY GEOLOGY

Now available from Dunedin Academic Press, "Planetary Geology: An 
Introduction (Second Edition)" [ISBN 9781780460154 - $49.50] Is written 
by Claudio Vita-Finzi and Dominic Fortes. Recent planetary missions by 
NASA, the European Space Agency, and other national agencies have 
reaffirmed that the geological processes which are familiar from our 
studies of the Earth operate on many solid planets and satellites. 
Common threads link the internal structure, thermal evolution, and 
surface character of both rocky and icy worlds. Volcanoes, impact 
craters, ice caps, dunes, rift valleys, rivers, and oceans are 
features of extra-terrestrial worlds as diverse as Mercury and 
Titan. "Planetary Geology" provides students and armchair enthusiasts 
with comprehensive coverage of the solar system viewed through the eyes 
of Earth scientists. This comprehensively updated second edition 
presents fresh evidence that planetary geology now embraces 
conventional geology and vice versa. Great for classes, the book 
contains numerous color illustrations. Place orders with Dunedin's
