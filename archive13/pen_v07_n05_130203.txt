POSTDOC OPENING: UNIVERSITY OF BERN, SWITZERLAND

The recently created Center for Space and Habitability of the 
University of Bern in Switzerland is seeking a Post-Doctoral Research 
Assistant. The position, under the supervision of Nick Thomas, is 
available immediately for 2 years. The aim of the project is to study 
the spectroscopic, polarization and reflectance properties of ices 
containing different abiotic and biotic contaminants using our 
existing laboratory facilities (PHIRE-2). Further details are 
available at:

http://space.unibe.ch/staff/thomas/positions.htm

Electronic applications should be submitted to Tina Rothenbuhler 
(tina.rothenbuehler@space.unibe.ch) by Feb. 21st.

AGU CHAPMAN CONFERENCE ON CROSSING THE BOUNDARIES IN PLANETARY 
ATMOSPHERES: FROM EARTH TO EXOPLANETS

Second Notice:
Abstracts are now being accepted, through Feb. 25, for the AGU Chapman 
Conference on Crossing the Boundaries in Planetary Atmospheres: From 
Earth to Exoplanets, 24-28 June 2013 in Annapolis, MD
 
We welcome submissions of posters or contributed talks (slots limited) 
that address the current state of knowledge of terrestrial and 
planetary climate systems, including their atmospheric chemistry, 
composition, and dynamics, plus atmospheric modeling, observational 
techniques, and data analysis methods. Preference will be given to 
those with an emphasis on cross-disciplinary science and techniques 
that can be applied to objects as diverse as the Earth, planets in 
our solar system, and exoplanets. You do not need to be an AGU
member to post an abstract. The preliminary program will be posted 
shortly, and we expect registration to open soon. To receive all 
future notices, you may also join the conference mailing list from 
our webpage, General Information link:

PLANETARY GEOLOGY & GEOPHYSICS UNDERGRADUATE RESEARCH PROGRAM (PGGURP)

The Planetary Geology and Geophysics Undergraduate Research Program 
(PGGURP) pairs PGG-funded PIs with qualified undergraduates for 8 weeks 
during the summer. PGGURP covers the cost of intern travel to and from 
your institution; room and board; and up to $1000 to help an intern 
present the results of their research at a national conference.

PGGURP mentors are responsible for helping the intern find local 
housing. Interns are required to submit a 2-page LPSC-style abstract 
to me at the end of the summer; you are expected to at least 
proof-read this abstract prior to its submission.

To request a PGGURP intern, please email Tracy Gregg 
(tgregg@buffalo.edu) with the following information by Friday, 
February 8 (same contact for questions).

1) A brief description of the project you have in mind
2) A list of the essential skills your intern must have to work on 
   this project (e.g., petrology, GIS, a year of calculus, computer 
   programming in a specific language).
3) A list of the desired skills your intern should have to work on 
   this project (skills that you'd like the intern to have, but aren't 
   required).

SECOND INFORMATION CIRCULAR FOR MEPAG #27 WEB MEETING

I cordially invite you to participate in the 27th meeting of the Mars 
Exploration Program Analysis Group (MEPAG), scheduled as an electronic 
meeting for February 27, 2013.

Delays in the federal budget process prompted us to cancel the two-day 
physical meeting previously scheduled February 26-27 for the 
Washington, DC area and to replace it with this half-day electronic 
meeting.

The new meeting time is 11:00 a.m. to 3:00 p.m. EST (8:00 a.m. to 
noon PST) on February 27, 2013.

Further details will be sent out in the next announcement.

A major development regarding future Mars missions since the last 
MEPAG meeting was the announcement by NASA Associate Administrator 
Dr. John Grunsfeld of a Mars Rover to be launched in 2020. MEPAG 
has invited NASA HQ to discuss in greater depth the status of the 
Mars Exploration Program, near term steps and what it means for the 
Mars community.

The meeting is open to all members of the Mars science community 
including our international colleagues. Thanks for your understanding 
regarding this meeting change. I look forward to your participation.

Sincerely,
Dr. David Des Marais MEPAG Chair

NASA POSTDOCTORAL FELLOWSHIPS

The NASA Postdoctoral Program (NPP) offers scientists and engineers 
unique opportunities to conduct research at NASA Centers. Each NPP 
fellowship opportunity is designed to advance NASA research in a 
specific project related to space science, earth science, aeronautics, 
exploration systems, lunar science, astrobiology, or astrophysics.

Applicants must have a Ph.D. or equivalent degree in hand before 
beginning the fellowship, but may apply while completing the degree 
requirements. U. S. citizens, Lawful Permanent Residents, and foreign 
nationals eligible for J-1 status as a Research Scholar may apply.

Stipends start at $53,500 per year, with supplements for high cost-
of-living areas and for certain academic specialties. Financial 
assistance is available for relocation and health insurance, and 
$8,000 per year is provided for professional travel.

Applications are accepted three times each year: March 1, July 1, 
and November 1.

PLANET MARS 4, LES HOUCHES, 20-25 OCTOBER 2013: FIRST ANNOUNCEMENT

On behalf of the organising committee, it is my pleasure to send out 
the attached announcement and welcome you all in joining us at the 4th 
workshop "Planet Mars", to be held in les Houches (France), on 
20-25 October 2013. The goals of the workshop are to integrate the
main results of both the recent Earth-based observations and the 
missions to Mars into a new global picture of Mars evolution.
With the same spirit of the previous workshops, discussions among
scientists of different disciplines will be encouraged and it is 
foreseen that they will help refine the scientific goals of the future 
missions to Mars.

Session PS06: Studies of Small Solar System Bodies and Insight into
Planetary System Formation

Abstract due: 8 February, 2013
  Submit your abstract to
  
http://www.asiaoceania.org/aogs2013/public.asp?page=abstract.htm

Session Rationale:
Small solar system bodies, such as asteroids, comets, trans-Neptunian
objects, meteors, and interplanetary dust particles, are remnants of
proto-solar nebula from which major objects in solar system were 
formed. Scientific interests for these primitive bodies include, but 
not limited to, physical characterization, understanding of the origin 
and early evolution of our solar system, and formation processes and 
configuration of other planetary systems. Recently, synergies of 
theoretical and modelling studies, laboratory experiments/analysis, 
ground and space-based observational studies, and in-situ measurements 
are making significant progress in research on small bodies and planet 
forming regions. This session reviews latest results on research of 
small bodies in the solar system and beyond, and discuss future 
development of this research field.

Session Conveners:
Daisuke Kinoshita, Henry Hsieh, Takashi Ito, Miriam Rengel, Ludmilla 
Kolokolova, Junichi Watanabe, Daniel Boice, Masateru Ishiguro, Alain 
Doressoundiram, A.-Chantal Levasseur-Regourd
