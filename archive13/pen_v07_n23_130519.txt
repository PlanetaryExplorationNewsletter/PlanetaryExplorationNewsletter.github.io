NASA POSTDOCTORAL FELLOWSHIPS

The NASA Postdoctoral Program (NPP) offers scientists and engineers 
unique opportunities to conduct research at NASA Centers. Each NPP 
fellowship opportunity is designed to advance NASA research in a 
specific project related to space science, earth science, aeronautics, 
exploration systems, lunar science, astrobiology, or astrophysics.

Applicants must have a Ph.D. or equivalent degree in hand before 
beginning the fellowship, but may apply while completing the degree 
requirements. U. S. citizens, Lawful Permanent Residents, and foreign 
nationals eligible for J-1 status as a Research Scholar may apply.

Stipends start at $53,500 per year, with supplements for high cost-of
-living areas and for certain academic specialties. Financial 
assistance is available for relocation and health insurance, and $8,000 
per year is provided for professional travel.

Applications are accepted three times each year: March 1, July 1, and 
November 1.

POSTDOCTORAL RESEARCHER, PLANETARY SCIENCE

The Earth and Planetary Sciences Department at the University of
Tennessee invites applications for a postdoctoral research position in
planetary remote sensing.  Research will focus on thermal modeling of
asteroid regoliths in support of the NASA-funded OSIRIS-REx sample
return mission.  Specific tasks will include assisting in the
development and testing of an asteroid thermal emission model to be 
used by the mission as well as analysis of existing thermal data of 
analog asteroids. Experience with numerical modeling is required. 
Candidates must have a PhD in the physical sciences (planetary 
science, geology, astronomy, physics, or related fields).

The initial appointment is for one year, but the appointment is
renewable for an additional year.  Review of applications will begin
July 1, 2013, and the position will remain open until filled. The
expected start date is October 1, 2013.

Applicants should submit (electronic submission is preferred) resume,
statement of research experience and interests, and letters of
recommendation from three references to Prof. Joshua Emery
(jemery2@utk.edu), Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences,
University of Tennessee, Knoxville, TN 37996. UTK is a EEO/AA/Title
IX/Section 504/ADA employer.

LLOYD V. BERKNER SPACE POLICY INTERNSHIPS AUTUMN 2013

The goal of the Lloyd V. Berkner Space Policy Internship is to provide 
promising undergraduate and graduate students with the opportunity to 
work in the area of civil space research policy in the nation's 
capital, under the aegis of the National Research Council's Space 
Science Board. The autumn program is open to undergraduate and 
graduate students. The deadline for applications is 7 June.  
Candidate(s) selected for will be contacted no later than 5 July.  
additional information about the program, including application 
procedure, can be found at:

ABSTRACT DEADLINE MAY 23RD - LARGE METEORITE IMPACTS AND PLANETARY 
EVOLUTION V

Dear colleagues,
The Large Meteorite Impacts and Planetary Evolution V meeting will 
be held in Sudbury, Ontario, Canada, on August 5-8, 2013. The 
abstract deadline is fast approaching: May 23rd! Details on the 
topics and scope of the conference are here: 

http://www.hou.usra.edu/meetings/sudbury2013/sudbury20132nd.shtml

This meeting should be of significant interest to the planetary 
science community and we encourage you to submit abstracts. In 
addition to the workshop presentations, there will be pre- and post-
conference field trips - including the chance to walk through a 
3 km thick differentiated impact melt sheet (!!) - and a short 
course on the numerical modelling of impact craters.
