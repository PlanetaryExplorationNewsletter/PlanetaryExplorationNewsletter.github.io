MESSENGER MDIS Data Users' Workshop

Since entering orbit in 2011, MESSENGER’s Mercury Dual Imaging System 
(MDIS) has acquired >100,000 images of Mercury’s surface and created 
the first global maps of the Solar System’s innermost planet. A 
MESSENGER MDIS Data Users' Workshop will be held in association with 
the 44th Lunar and Planetary Science Conference on Sunday, March 17, 
2013, from 2:00 PM - 6:00 PM. This workshop will introduce the 
available MDIS products, the calibrations applied, and tools for 
finding and using MDIS data, and is intended for anyone interested in 
using the data. To learn more about this workshop and to register,

NEXT-GENERATION SUBORBITAL RESEARCHERS CONFERENCE (NSRC) 2013: 
ABSTRACT DEADLINE APPROACHING

NSRC-2013 will be the fourth in a series of 3-day topical meetings held 
since 2010 for the next-generation suborbital research and education 
(REM) communities. The meeting is designed to educate researchers and 
EPO professionals about the capabilities of the new generation of 
commercially-available reusable suborbital vehicles, funding and flight 
opportunities for flying experiments on these vehicles, and the kinds 
of experiments various research communities--including microgravity 
physics, astrophysics and planetary science, life sciences, and 
atmospheric science are planning. The meeting includes a NASA night.
NSRC typically has over 400 attendees. Confirmed keynote speakers for 
2013 include NASA Deputy Administrator Lori Garver, Commercial 
Spaceflight Federation President and former NASA astronaut Mike 
Lopez-Alegria, and FAA Associate Administrator George Nield. This 
year's meeting will be held June 3-5 in Broomfield, Colorado, just 
outside Boulder. The meeting web site is at:

NASA PROPOSAL WRITING WORKSHOP AT LPSC

Curious about how to improve the quality of the proposals you send to 
NASA? Ever wonder what the review panel is really looking for when it 
that proposal? The Planetary Science Division at NASA Headquarters is 
offering a Proposal Writing Workshop at LPSC that is based on the 
cumulative experience of current and former Discipline Scientists who 
have managed a variety of Research and Announcement (R&A) programs at 
NASA Headquarters. The specific focus of this intense, educational 
session is to provide a greater understanding of NASA's research 
programs and review process and offer constructive insight into 
writing an effective research proposal. The event is open to all at 
no charge and will be held on Sunday, March 17, from 12-5 pm in 
Montgomery Ballroom A. All interested planetary scientists, from 
graduate students through emeritus professors, are encouraged to 
attend. 

To register, send an e-mail with your name, affiliation, and current 
position to curt.niebur@nasa.gov.

NASA AO TOWN HALL MEETING AT LPSC

The preparation of an Announcement of Opportunity (AO) is a lengthy 
process involving a large group of stakeholders and interested parties. 
The Planetary Science Division has begun planning for the next 
Discovery and New Frontiers AOs. This preparation includes compiling 
lessons learned, evaluating the effectiveness and impact of past AO 
policies, and considering changes to the AO process and its policies 
and requirements.  As part of this effort NASA is hosting a community 
discussion at LPSC. NASA participants will include Michael New, Lead 
Program Scientist for the Discovery Program; Curt Niebur, Lead Program 
Scientist for the New Frontiers Program; and Len Dudzinski, Program 
Executive for RPS Program. Participants will present their thoughts on 
past AO experiences as well as the early stages of the preparation 
process for the next AOs. Interested community members can share their 
experience and feedback as short (3 minute) presentations. Time will 
be reserved for a discussion with attendees led by Drs. New and Niebur. 
It is expected that time constraints will limit the number of community 
presentations, so interested presenters are encouraged to contact Curt 
Niebur at curt.niebur@nasa.gov prior to the meeting.

NASA POSTDOCTORAL FELLOWSHIPS

The NASA Postdoctoral Program (NPP) offers scientists and engineers 
unique opportunities to conduct research at NASA Centers. Each NPP 
fellowship opportunity is designed to advance NASA research in a 
specific project related to space science, earth science, aeronautics, 
exploration systems, lunar science, astrobiology, or astrophysics.

Applicants must have a Ph.D. or equivalent degree in hand before 
beginning the fellowship, but may apply while completing the degree 
requirements. U.S. citizens, Lawful Permanent Residents, and foreign 
nationals eligible for J-1 status as a Research Scholar may apply.

Stipends start at $53,500 per year, with supplements for high 
cost-of-living areas and for certain academic specialties. Financial 
assistance is available for relocation and health insurance, and 
$8,000 per year is provided for professional travel.

[NASA] CALL FOR VOLUNTEER REVIEWERS FOR NESSF PROGRAM

The Planetary Science Division in NASA's Science Mission Directorate 
is recruiting reviewers for the NASA Earth and Space Science 
Fellowship (NESSF) program. These are graduate student fellowship 
proposals that cover a wide range of planetary topics. The review 
panels will be held virtually via Webex (no travel required) in mid 
to late April.
 
PSD especially encourages postdoctoral fellows and early-career 
professionals to apply and get some experience on a review panel. 
Serving on a review panel is one of the best ways to improve your 
proposal-writing skills. If you are interested in serving on this 
panel, please visit the SARA volunteer reviewer website:

VENUS-RELATED POSTDOCTORAL FELLOWSHIP AT NASA GLENN RESEARCH CENTER 

Applications are now being accepted for a postdoctoral Fellowship at 
NASA Glenn Research Center (GRC) related to Venus studies. The 
Fellowship will concentrate on in-situ Venus geophysics/atmospheric 
physics and chemistry science carried out in Venus relevant 
environments, and exploring the capabilities of potential harsh 
environment instrumentation suites to provide relevant science data 
related to these studies. The candidate may use the harsh environment 
simulation capabilities at NASA GRC  to conduct scientific 
investigations into Venus geophysics/atmospheric physics and chemistry
studies towards addressing decadal science and preparing for potential 
Venus in situ science missions. Research also entails verification of 
various forms of instrumentation required to address decadal science 
questions and/potentially incorporate the work  on future missions in 
the respective environments. Similar science for other planetary bodies 
may also be considered based on relevance to these research topics and 
applicant interest.
 
Requirements are a recent Ph.D. in geophysics/ geology or atmospheric 
physics. Experience in experiment design or instrument/space craft 
system development is desirable.
