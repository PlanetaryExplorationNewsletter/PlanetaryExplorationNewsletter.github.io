POSTDOCTORAL FELLOW, GEOPHYSICAL INSTITUTE, UNIVERSITY OF ALASKA 
FAIRBANKS

The Geophysical Institute, University of Alaska Fairbanks, is seeking 
a geoscientist to develop expertise for stereo photogrammetry with a 
range of Alaska and planetary data sets. The scientist will then use 
some of those data sets to conduct analyses of terrestrial and 
planetary volcanic and impact-melt features. Position is funded for 
three years, and it is common for postdocs to transition to permanent 
faculty positions at UAF.  Applicants should have a PhD in a relevant 
field (successful dissertation defense in Fall semester, 2013, is 
acceptable). Experience in fluid mechanics, photogeology, volcanology, 
impact cratering mechanics, stereo photogrammetry, and using SOCET SET 
software are desired, but not required, job skills. See the YouTube 
recruiting video at:

Further inquiries can be directed to Robert Herrick 
(rherrick@gi.alaska.edu).

Review of applications will begin September 23, 2013, and 
applications will be considered until the position is filled.

NASA POSTDOCTORAL FELLOWSHIPS
 
The NASA Postdoctoral Program (NPP) provides opportunities for 
scientists and engineers to conduct research largely of their own 
choosing, yet compatible with the research opportunities posted on the 
NPP Web site.
 
Selected by a competitive peer-review process, NPP Fellows complete 
one- to three-year Fellowship appointments that advance NASA's 
missions in earth science, heliophysics, planetary science, 
astrophysics, space bioscience, aeronautics and engineering, human 
exploration and space operations, and astrobiology.
 
An example of one of the research opportunities in planetary science 
is:
 
https://www3.orau.gov/NPDoc/Catalog/18395
 
Applicants must have a Ph.D. or equivalent degree in hand before 
beginning the fellowship, but may apply while completing the degree 
requirements. U. S. citizens, Lawful Permanent Residents, and foreign 
nationals eligible for J-1 status as a Research Scholar may apply.
 
Stipends start at $53,500 per year, with supplements for high cost-
of-living areas and for certain academic specialties. Financial 
assistance is available for relocation and health insurance, and 
$8,000 per year is provided for professional travel.
 
Applications are accepted three times each year: March 1, July 1, 
and November 1.

[NASA] TUTORIAL FOR PROPOSAL SUBMISSION TO THE NSPIRES SYSTEM

NASA's Office of Education, Minority University Research and Education 
Project (MUREP) along with NASA Research and Education Support Services 
(NRESS) will conduct an overview of the NSPIRES application submission 
process on September 12, 2013 at 3:00 PM EST.
 
MUREP engages underrepresented populations through a wide variety of 
opportunities.  Multiyear grants are awarded to assist Minority 
Serving Institution (MSI) faculty and students in research pertinent to 
NASA missions. The project focuses on recruiting underrepresented and
underserved students in STEM disciplines through completion of 
undergraduate or graduate degrees to enable their entry into the 
scientific and technical workforce.
 
Submitting a proposal in NSPIRES is not a difficult process, however a 
tutorial of the process will assist with successful submission of your
proposal.
 
If you are interested in participating in the webinar, please register 
by sending your name, email address and phone number to
NSPIRESWebexRSVP@nasaprs.com.
 
Any questions you may have can be included with your registration, or 
sent separately to NSPIRESWebexRSVP@nasaprs.com, no later than 11:59 
p.m. EST on September 11, 2013. Live questions will be answered during 
the session, however questions received in advance will allow the call 
leaders to prepare a more focalized discussion.

CALL FOR OBSERVATIONS: EARTH-BASED OBSERVING CAMPAIGN IN SUPPORT OF 
THE NEW HORIZONS MISSION TO PLUTO

The July 2015 New Horizons encounter with Pluto presents a once-in-a
-lifetime opportunity to directly link our Earth-based view of the 
Pluto system with 'ground truth' provided by in situ measurements. 
With the encouragement of Dr. James L. Green, Director of Planetary 
Science, NASA Headquarters, a call for observations is being made in 
support of the New Horizons mission. Observers throughout the 
international community are invited to participate. The goal of the 
observing campaign is to establish an extensive Earth-based 
measurement context for the state of the Pluto system at the time of 
the flyby, including evolving trends in the system for at least one 
year prior- and post-flyby. Further details on the campaign are 
available here:

http://www.boulder.swri.edu/nh-support-obs/

Please register your interest by sending an email to:

nhobs "at" boulder.swri.edu  

In addition, informal workshops (information sessions) are being 
planned during the European Planetary Science Conference (EPSC) in 
London 8-13 September and during the Division for Planetary Sciences 
Meeting (DPS) in Denver 6-11 October. The DPS workshop will be on 
Tuesday, 8 October at 12:00noon-1:00pm in the Plaza Ballroom E at the 
Sheraton Denver Downtown.

[NASA] REQUEST FOR INFORMATION REGARDING EXTREME ENVIRONMENTS

NASA released a Centennial Challenge for Extreme Environments Request 
for Information (RFI) soliciting feedback as it considers a challenge 
to foster technology maturation for subsystems operating in extreme
environments, such as the surface of Venus. The challenge under 
consideration is a phased series of demonstrations focused on 
electronics/mechanisms, thermal management, power, and eventually a 
simple system/probe. The purposes of this RFI are: (1) gather feedback 
on the competition, (2) determine the level of interest in competing 
and, (3) understand the applicability to terrestrial applications.
 
A NASA challenge to draw out creative and innovative solutions to our
technology problems is an exciting opportunity for the planetary 
community. This challenge may be another way to leverage scarce 
resources to eventually allow scientists to "probe" the more difficult
destinations in our solar system. 
 
The planetary science and the technology and engineering communities 
are encouraged to respond to the RFI and provide inputs by September 
10, 2013. Details of the Challenge conditions and prize award can be 
found at:

MARS CRITICAL DATA PRODUCTS PROGRAM (ROUND VIII) - COMET SIDING SPRING
MODELING
 
The Mars Exploration Program has issued, in August 2013, a Request for 
Proposal (RFP) for round VIII of the Mars Critical Data Products 
program at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory.  This RFP provides support 
of the modeling the dust and particle environment of Comet 2013 A1 
(Siding Spring) during its encounter with Mars in October 2014. The 
intent is to provide data products useful for risk assessment and 
mitigation strategy development for the Mars orbiter missions, due to 
possible impacts from dust and ion tail particles as this comet 
encounters Mars. Proposals are due on Wednesday, September 11, 2013.

Details of the RFPs are posted at:
