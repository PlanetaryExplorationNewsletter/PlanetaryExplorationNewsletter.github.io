[NASA] RESEARCH OPPORTUNITIES IN SPACE AND EARTH SCIENCES (ROSES) 2008

NNH08ZDA001N, entitled "Research Opportunities in Space and Earth
Sciences - 2008 (ROSES-2008)," will be available on or about February
15, 2008, by opening the NASA Research Opportunities homepage at:

http://nspires.nasaprs.com/ 

and then linking through the menu listings "Solicitations" to "Open
Solicitations."  This NASA Research Announcement (NRA) solicits 
proposals for supporting basic and applied research and technology
across a broad range of Earth and space science program elements 
relevant to one or more of the following NASA Research Programs:
Earth Science, Heliophysics, Planetary Science, and Astrophysics.

Proposal due dates are scheduled starting on May 9, 2008, and
continue through March 27, 2009.  Electronically submitted Notices of
Intent to propose are requested for most program elements, with the
first such due date being March 14, 2008.

Further information about specific program elements may be obtained
from the individual Program Officers listed in the Summary of Key
Information for each program element in this NRA, while questions
concerning general NRA policies and procedures may be directed to Dr.
Yvonne Pendleton, Senior Advisor for Research and Analysis, Science
Mission Directorate, NASA Headquarters, Washington, DC 20546-0001;

[NASA] OFFERS PRE-SCREENING OF PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR REQUIREMENTS FOR
NEW FRONTIERS OPPORTUNITY

The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Science
Mission Directorate (SMD) plans to release an Announcement of
Opportunity (AO) for the third New Frontiers (NF-3) mission no
earlier than June 2008.  Downselection would occur in 2009. 

In compliance with SMD policy, the Principal Investigators (PI) for a
New Frontiers mission must demonstrate minimum experience
qualifications that are designed to demonstrate relevant experience
exercising responsibility, authority, and management of a space
project in the areas of leadership, planning, implementation, and
approval.

requirements, go to

[NSF/NASA] PROPOSAL OPPORTUNITY FOR MANAGEMENT OF THE VIRTUAL 
ASTRONOMICAL OBSERVATORY

Proposals are solicited to manage and operate the Virtual
Astronomical Observatory (VAO) through a cooperative agreement with
the National Science Foundation (NSF), in partnership with the
National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA).

The Virtual Astronomical Observatory will serve to link a multitude
of astronomical data sets into an integrated system that allows
automated search and analysis among all cataloged objects. The VAO
will provide access to data sets, create and maintain data protocols
and standards, and provide analysis tools and services to the
astronomical research and educational community. The VAO is expected
to act as an enabling and coordinating structure to facilitate the
development of tools, protocols, and collaborations necessary to
utilize fully the scientific potential of current and future 
astronomical data.

Proposals are due April 22, 2008. This is a joint NSF/NASA program.
The solicitation and proposal management are being handled by NSF.
Proposers may opt to submit proposals via Grants.gov or via the NSF
FastLane system. Proposals may not be submitted via NSPIRES. The
review process will be run, and the award decision will be made,
jointly by NSF and NASA. See:

http://www.nsf.gov/funding/pgm_summ.jsp?pims_id=13618 

for full details.

Questions may be directed to Dr. Nigel Sharp, VAO Program Officer,
Division of Astronomical Sciences, National Science Foundation; Email
nsharp@nsf.gov; Phone (703) 292-4905; or to Dr. Alan Smale,
Astrophysics Division, National Aeronautics and Space Administration;

NEW SPECTROSCOPY ARCHIVE AT THE UNIVERSITY OF WINNIPEG

The Planetary Spectrophotometer Facility (PSF) at the University of 
Winnipeg is making available digital files of both newly acquired 
and archived laboratory spectroscopic data as well as associated 
sample information at its newly constructed web site: 

http://psf.uwinnipeg.ca 

The web site includes information on the facility's instrumentation 
and capabilities, and the archive includes data acquired over the 
past 20 years. The PSF is also available for conducting spectroscopic 
measurements for other investigators on an as-available basis.

For additional details visit the web site or contact the Director, 
Dr. Ed Cloutis (e.cloutis@uwinnipeg.ca; tel: (204) 786 9386 or 
Laboratory Manager, Mr. Dan Bailey (da.bailey@uwinnipeg.ca; 
tel: (204) 786 9994).

INTERNATIONAL PLANETARY PROBE WORKSHOP SECOND ANNOUNCEMENT

Dear Colleagues,

See:

http://www.planetaryprobe.org/ 

for details of the 6th International Planetary Probe Workshop (IPPW6) 
and Short Course on Extreme Environment Technologies.

Where: Atlanta, Georgia, USA.

When: 21-27 June 2008

The goal of the workshop is to bring together scientists, 
technologists, engineers, mission designers, and policy makers
interested in the exploration of solar system bodies with
substantial atmospheres. The workshop covers the technological
challenges and scientific opportunities associated with entry, 
descent, landing and flight in planetary atmospheres.

A preliminary list of session topics includes: a historical 
perspective; science and technology of current entry probes;
miniprobes; probes designed for missions to giant planets; planetary
entry probe technologies; and earth sample return missions.

Abstract deadline: 3 March 2008
