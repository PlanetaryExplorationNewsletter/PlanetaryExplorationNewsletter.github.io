[SPECIAL NASA MESSAGE] FROM JAMES GREEN, DIRECTOR, PLANETARY SCIENCE 
DIVISION, NASA HQ - PI QUALIFICATIONS FOR NEW FRONTIER'S MISSIONS 
 
As promised, the Planetary Science Division is working hard to release 
our next major Announcement of Opportunity (AO) for New Frontiers. We 
have asked the National Academy to provide criteria and guiding 
principles for determining the list of candidate missions for that AO. 
We expect the Academy report within the next couple of months and I 
know they are working hard on their deliberations. Please note that we 
will not release a draft of the New Frontier's AO without reviewing the
Academy's critical input. In the meantime, I want to draw your 
attention to the fact that, like the SMEX AO, we will be requiring that
Principal Investigators (PI) for a New Frontiers mission demonstrate a 
set of minimum experience qualifications. These qualifications will be 
more extensive then what was required for the SMEX AO. It is my 
intention to have a web version of these qualifications available 
starting within the month of January for you to be 'pre-screened.'
Notification that this web site is available for your use will be sent 
out from several notification systems so please be on the look out for 
it. If you are planning to PI a proposal, it is in your best interest 
to be ready to respond quickly with a comprehensive set of information
delineating your experience.

[NASA] MESSAGE FROM YVONNE PENDLETON, SMD SENIOR ADVISOR FOR RESEARCH & 
ANALYSIS (SARA)

The most recent updates to the SARA webpage have just been made. Go to
http://science.hq.nasa.gov/research/sara.html 

A list of page changes can be found at 
http://science.hq.nasa.gov/research/sara_whats_new.html

Dear Colleagues,

The R & A Management Operations Working group has just been finalized, 
and I thank each of the following individuals for agreeing to serve 
in this capacity. I will update the list next time with their contact 
information, but you are encouraged to be in touch with them as we go 
forward in the process of discussing R & A process improvements and the 
many new ideas we all have for ways to get more out of our R & A 
dollars. The MOWG will meet primarily through videoconferencing, 
perhaps as often as twice a month initially, and we expect to have at 
least one in person meeting sometime in March.

Below are the names of the individuals, their current position, and 
their research area of expertise.

Guenter Riegler, Retired NASA Senior Executive, Chair (Astrophysics)
Steve Bougher, U of M, Co-Chair (Planetary Science)
Spiro Antiochos, NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, (Heliophysics)
Joshua (Josh) Grindlay, Harvard University (Astrophysics)
Lynne Hillenbrand, Caltech (Astrophysics)
Everette Joseph, Howard University, (Earth Science)
James (Jim) Kasting, Penn State (Earth Science)
Adam Showman, U of A (LPL) (Planetary Science)
Harold (Hal) Levison, SwRI (Planetary Science)
Margaret (Maggie) Tolbert, U of CO (Earth Science)

In addition, Paul Hertz and I have also asked our internal science 
staff (the program officers and the division management within SMD) to 
provide input on issues related to our panel review practices. The goal 
is to document SMD's R & A Review Practices and communicate these 
clearly to the external community. Our objectives in this exercise are 
to:

1. Document SMD's best and acceptable practices for R & A reviews
2. Provide additional guidance to program officers
3. Offer additional transparency into SMD process to community
4. Provide assurance (to SMD managers, to the community, to auditors) 
that SMD program officers are following SMD policies and practices

Your input through the SARA email and through the town hall meetings 
has contributed to the items we will discuss in this process, and you 
are welcome to send me additional input at any time. We will complete 
our internal review and documentation process by mid-March, so that 
these items will be clearly articulated to all before the first ROSES 
panel meets for the FY08 cycle.

Speaking of ROSES08, you can find a list of the program elements on the 
grant stats page today. Many hours of hard work went into the 
development of the ROSES08 call, especially by Paul Hertz, Max 
Bernstein, and the program officers responsible for each element. 
Please thank them when you have a chance.

Other items in today's update include the presentation at the AAS 
meeting in Austin by Alan Stern and Jon Morse, a report on the EPO MOWG 
activities from the kick-off meeting January 14, and new science 
highlights. As always, a complete list of the updated pages can be 
found on the What's New page.

Best Wishes,

Yvonne
