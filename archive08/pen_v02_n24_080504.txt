AUTUMN 2008 LLOYD V. BERKNER SPACE POLICY INTERNSHIP AT THE NATIONAL
RESEARCH COUNCIL'S SPACE STUDIES BOARD

As part of its celebration of the 50th anniversary of its founding, 
the Space Studies Board (SSB) has expanded the scope of the Space 
Policy Intern program it has operated since 1992 by initiating the 
Lloyd V. Berkner Space Policy Internships. The goal of the program 
is to provide promising undergraduate and graduate students with the 
opportunity to work in the area of civil space research policy in 
the Nation's capital, under the aegis of the SSB.

Established in 1958 to serve as the focus of the interests and 
responsibilities in space research for the National Academies, the 
Board provides an independent, authoritative forum for information 
and advice on all aspects of space science and applications. It 
oversees advisory studies and program assessments, facilitates 
international research coordination, and promotes communications on 
space science and science policy between the research community, 
the federal government, and the interested public. The SSB also 
serves as the U.S. National Committee for the International Council 
for Science (ICSU) Committee on Space Research (COSPAR).

Application deadlines:

June 16 - Autumn 2008 program (undergraduates and graduate students)
February 2 - Summer 2009 (undergraduates only)

15TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON THE ORIGIN OF LIFE

The 15th International Conference on the Origin of Life 

http://www.dbag.unifi.it/issol2008/  

sponsored by the ISSOL, The International Astrobiology Society, will 
be held in Florence, Italy, August 24-29, 2008. As you may see from 
the on-line program, the current list of speakers, and the Second 
Announcement, the topics to be covered at the conference include 
most of astrobiology and relevant planetary science. We are assured 
of an exciting meeting with a very international participation.

We are endeavoring to extend the deadline for early (less expensive) 
registration for an additional month, past the current deadline of 
May 1. Of course, later registration is certainly possible.

Note that travel grants for young scientists with accepted 
contributions are available to ISSOL members.

GSA SESSION ON ANALOG SITES AND FIELD EXERCISES FOR TRAINING PLANETARY 
FIELD GEOLOGISTS

Geological Society of America Joint Annual Meeting, October 5 - 9, 
2008, Houston, Texas

Sponsors: GSA Planetary Geology Division; GSA Geoscience Education 
Division; Gulf Coast Association of Geological Societies

We encourage those interested in planetary sciences, field work, and 
the education of the next generation to submit an abstract to GSA 
session T110 which covers educational field activities that can be 
completed by students at a suite of planetary analog sites.  

Submissions can cover past, ongoing, or future ideas for activities 
at a single field site, workshops, camps, trips with activities 
geared for college and graduate students, post-docs, and K-12 
Educators and with no limits to locations, length of activity, or 
number of field participants.  

Presentations should focus on: 1) the overall geology and field 
objectives, 2) data sets and planetary equivalents, 3) field methods 
and integration of new technology, 4) results of the field exercise 
and any student feedback, and 5) what comparative insight into 
planetary geologic processes is gained.
