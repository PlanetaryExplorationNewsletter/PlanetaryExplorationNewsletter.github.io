SOLICTING PAPERS: PROPOSED GSA BOOK ON LUNAR STRATIGRAPHY

Scope: The proposed GSA Special Publication "Recent Advances in Lunar
Stratigraphy" will be a comprehensive review of current investigations
and discoveries in lunar stratigraphy. An improved knowledge of lunar
stratigraphy, based on detailed mapping of the Moon's surface and
interior with integrated data sets, will be valuable in supporting
the return to the Moon, as well as leading to efficient development
of lunar resources. Many planetary geologists are currently involved
in seeking answers to problems in lunar stratigraphy, and their
application to the current program of lunar exploration promises to be
of great interest to the general scientific community. We are 
soliciting for this edited volume papers that provide new insights 
into lunar stratigraphy. These papers will be peer-reviewed and will
be regarded as high-quality articles, comparable to those in major
scientific journals.

Timeline: This special publication is planned for release in the 
first quarter 2010. Interested authors are invited to send proposed
titles of articles to either William Ambrose or David Williams by
December 31, 2008. If sufficient titles are submitted, then a
manuscript deadline in the first quarter of 2009 will be announced.

STARDUST AND COSMIC DUST ANNOUNCEMENTS

STARDUST

Stardust Interstellar Preliminary Examination samples are now 
available for request and allocation. Approximately 20 keystones 
and picokeystones that have been extracted from the Stardust 
Interstellar Tray are available, including:

(1) blank keystones
(2) off-normal tracks likely to be secondary ejecta from impacts on 
the Stardust spacecraft
(3) features that were examined by FTIR, SXRF and STXM and determined
to be unlikely to be extraterrestrial 

None of these samples appear to be completely consistent with 
interstellar or interplanetary dust particles.  

A catalog of these samples may be viewed at the JSC Curation website
at:

http://curator.jsc.nasa.gov/stardust/sample_catalog/Interstellar/
Interstellar_Index.cfm 

Directions for sample requests are given at:

http://curator.jsc.nasa.gov/stardust/Investigator_guidebook.pdf

Sample requests will be evaluated using criteria similar to those used
for evaluating cometary samples. Investigators must be qualified to
analyze samples, as outlined in the Stardust Investigator's Handbook.  

COSMIC DUST

As previously announced, the Cosmic Dust Lab will be reopened for a
limited time this Fall for sample allocation work.  Requests for 
cosmic Dust will be accepted by the curator from now until November 30
2008.  Please visit the Cosmic Dust webpage for more information on 
sample availability and sample request requirements.

7TH INTERNATIONAL PLANETARY PROBE WORKSHOP, 15-19 JUNE 2009 AND SHORT
COURSE ON PLANETARY PROTECTION, 13-14 JUNE 2009

Join us for the 7th International Planetary Probe Workshop (IPPW-7) in
Barcelona, Spain on 13 - 19 June 2009. The goal of the workshop is to
bring together scientists, technologists, engineers, mission designers,
and policy makers interested in the exploration of solar system bodies
with atmospheres that allow the use of probes with parachutes. The
workshop covers the technological challenges and scientific
opportunities associated with entry, descent, landing and flight in
planetary atmospheres.

The 7th workshop will build on the success of the previous workshops,
to promote international cooperation in probe missions to solar system
moons and planets with atmospheres, and to provide the opportunity for
students - the next generation of planetary scientists - as well as
spacecraft engineers, technologists, mission planners, and policy
makers to participate in these endeavours.

In addition to the five-day workshop, a two-day short course is 
normally held on a related topic during the preceding weekend. The
topic selected for IPPW7 is Planetary Protection (13-14 June 2009).
