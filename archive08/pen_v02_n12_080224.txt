POST-DOC OPPORTUNITY AT CU-BOULDER

CU-Boulder has an open Post-Doctoral Research Position for work 
related to landslides and granular mechanics on asteroids.  The 
initial position is for one year with an additional year follow-on 
possible.  Work will involve collaboration between CU and researchers 
at UC-Santa Cruz and will entail applying landslide or granular 
mechanics theory and computational tools to the asteroid environment. 
Duties may require creation and modification of simulation codes, 
theoretical study of multi-body contact mechanics, and some laboratory 
experiments. Position is based in Boulder, CO with several trips to 
Santa Cruz, CA for collaboration meetings and research.
