[NASA] NSPIRES UNAVAILABLE

NSPIRES is unavailable as of Friday July 25, and may not be 
available until next week. Four ROSES-08 program elements have 
proposal due dates within the next week. The due dates for all four 
will be deferred. Due dates for any Notices of Intent (NOIs) to 
propose that are due next week will also be deferred.

The deferral will be at least the number of days that NSPIRES is 
unavailable, and proposals will be due no earlier than two days 
after NSPIRES is available again. The program elements that will be 
deferred are: 

B.9 SDO Science Center (scheduled to be due Friday July 25)
A.27 SMAP SDT (scheduled to be due Tuesday July 29)
A.21 ACT (scheduled to be due Wednesday July 30)
A.26 ICESat II SDT (scheduled to be due Wednesday July 30)

When new due dates are set, an NSPIRES email announcement will be 
sent to the community and the new due dates will be posted on 
NSPIRES.

FALL AGU SESSION: RECENT ADVANCES IN PLANETARY VOLCANOLOGY

Dear Colleagues,

We are soliciting abstracts for the following session that will be
held at the 2008 Fall AGU Meeting in San Francisco, December 14-19:

Recent Advances in Planetary Volcanology

Cosponsors:  Planetary Sciences, Volcanology, Geochemistry, and 
Petrology (VGP)

Conveners:  Laszlo Keszthelyi (USGS Astrogeology Team) and David
Williams (ASU School of Earth and Space Exploration)

Description: Ongoing space missions have recently returned data on
volcanism ranging from sun-baked Mercury to hyperactive Io.
Volcanoes small and large are being scrutinized by an armada of 
Mars spacecraft even as a new wave of lunar exploration begins,
and Cassini continues to identify evidence of cryovolcanism on 
Saturn's moons.  This session provides a venue for the sharing of 
recent discoveries and comparison of volcanism across the Solar 
System.

Abstract Submission Deadline:  September 10, 2008

Cheers,
Dave Williams and Laszlo Keszthelyi
