[NASA] NASA HQ EVENTS AT LPSC 2008

NASA Headquarters will host two events at the Lunar and Planetary
Science Conference that may be of interest to planetary science
researchers.  On Sunday, March 9, discipline scientists from NASA
Headquarters will host a proposal writing workshop at the South Shore
Harbour Resort & Conference Center. The workshop is open to all
interested planetary scientists from senior graduate students on up and
is free of charge. The morning session will focus on understanding
NASA's research programs and will include information on how to write
a research proposal, where to apply for funding, and what kind of
feedback one can expect. Other opportunities for funding, such as
participating scientist programs and education/public outreach add-on
awards, will also be discussed. The afternoon session will be a Mock
Peer Review for participants who are ready to apply for grants and 
want to understand what happens to their proposal after submission.  
To register, send an e-mail with your name, affiliation, and current 
position to
 
curt.niebur@nasa.gov.

On Tuesday, March 11, discipline scientists from the Planetary Science
Division in the Science Mission Directorate at NASA Headquarters will
host an informal R&A reception at the Lunar and Planetary Science
Conference.  It's your chance to meet the people who manage the 
programs that provide funding for your research efforts and talk with
them one-on-one.  The event will run from 12:00-1:00 pm in the Harbour
Club, and light hors d'oeuvres will be served.

If you have any questions please feel free to contact Curt Niebur at

curt.niebur@nasa.gov.

LUNAR GEOCHEMISTRY AND CHRONOLOGY SESSION AT GOLDSCHMIDT CONFERENCE
2008, VANCOUVER, CANADA

Dear Community,
 
As co-conveners of the "Lunar Geochemistry and Chronology" Session  at 
the upcoming Goldschmidt conference 2008, Vancouver, B.C., Canada from
July 13th-18th, we would like to invite you to participate in this 
session and submit an abstract by March 1st, 2008. Accepted abstracts
will be published in Geochimica et Cosmochmica Acta.

The focus of the session is:
 
The fields of lunar geochemistry and chronology have been revitalized
in recent years by new global data obtained from orbit, numerous new
lunar samples from randomly distributed locations in the form of lunar
meteorites, and new and improved analytical techniques.  This session
focuses on the currently evolving outlooks that data from these
various resources are providing in the fields of early differentiation
of the Moon, mantle and crust formation and evolution, and lunar 
(Earth) impact history.
 
For more information:

http://www.goldschmidt2008.org/themeView?theme=1

Your participation is important to bring together several researchers
in the community with your latest work and to creat good and productive
discussions in the fields of lunar geochemistry and chronology.
 
For more information on the conference and themes:

We look forward to your contributions!  Please forward this message to
others potentially interested.
 
Best Regards,

EUROPEAN PLANETARY SCIENCE CONGRESS 2008 EPSC FIRST ANNOUNCEMENT AND 
CALL FOR FEEDBACK 

The 3rd European Planetary Science Congress will take place at the 
University Muenster from September 22-26, 2008. This represents a 
cooperation between the EuroPlanet network and the European Geosciences
Union. It is intended to provide an attractive platform to exchange and
present results, develop new ideas and to network the planetary science
community in Europe. It will have a distinctively interactive style,
with a mix of talks, workshops and posters, intended to provide a
stimulating environment for the community to meet. The meeting will
cover the whole scope of planetary science. We therefore encourage you
to prepare for session or workshop proposals. 

We thank you for making the last EPSC in August 2007 a success with
430 participants from most fields of planetary science. In order to
ensure a high scientific and technical quality of the next congress,
we ask you to send any comments or feedback concerning the last
meeting to Ralf Srama (ralf.srama@mpi-hd.mpg.de) or Manuel Grande
(mng@aber.ac.uk). 

Kind regards, 
Ralf Srama and Manuel Grande
