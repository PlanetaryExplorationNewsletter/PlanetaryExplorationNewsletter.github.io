ESA MARS EXPRESS DATA AVAILABLE THROUGH PDS

Through a cooperative agreement between NASA and the European Space 
Agency (ESA), the Planetary Data System hosts copies of archives from
ESA’s Mars Express mission. The latest additions to the archives are
the raw and derived data sets from the MARSIS Subsurface Sounding 
Radar/Altimeter. The primary objective of MARSIS is to map the 
distribution of water and ice in the upper portions of the Martian 
crust. The instrument analyzes reflections of radio waves in the upper
2-3 km of Martian crust to reveal the subsurface structure. The MARSIS
Principal Investigator is Prof. Giovanni Picardi, Universita di Roma 
'La Sapienza', Rome, Italy.

- Mars Express MARSIS Experiment Data Record
- Mars Express MARSIS Reduced Data Record Subsurface
- Mars Express MARSIS RDR Active Ionosphere Sounding

These data sets may be accessed at this Planetary Data System URL:

The primary resource for MARSIS data is the ESA Planetary Science 
Archive at this URL:
