SPECIAL ISSUE ON THE THARSIS PROVINCE, MARS

Journal of Volcanology and Geothermal Research (JVGR) special issue:

Tectonic and Volcanic History of the Tharsis Province, Mars

Guest Editors; Jacob Bleacher, James Dohm

This message is to notify you of an upcoming publication opportunity 
through JVGR. A thematic issue entitled "Tectonic and Volcanic History
of the Tharsis Province, Mars" is in preparation and it will include a
suite of papers based on analyses of post-Viking era data. 

We would like to invite you to submit a manuscript if your work is 
related to this topic. All manuscripts will be subject to the 
standard review process maintained by JVGR, and must be deemed by the 
editorial staff to be within the scope of the thematic volume.  The 
goal for this issue is to follow a strict schedule with publication 
before the end of 2008.  The deadline for submission is May 16th, 2008.
If you anticipate submitting a manuscript, please e-mail either:

Jacob Bleacher, Jacob.Bleacher-1@nasa.gov
James Dohm, jmd@hwr.arizona.edu   
 
Provide a title and an author list.  This information will help us 
assemble reviewers so that they will be in place by the submission 
deadline.  We plan to provide reviews within two months of submission 
in order to maintain our publication deadline.

VEXAG MEETING #5, MAY 7-8, 2008, UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND

The next VEXAG Meeting will be held on Wednesday-Thursday, May 7-8, 
2008 at the University of Maryland Conference Center.

A key topic for this meeting will be an interim report by the Venus 
STDT, reporting on their progress since starting in January 2008. 
Other topics of interest will be progress reports on ESA's Venus 
Express and JAXA's Venus Climate Orbiter,follow-ups to the Venus-Earth 
Climate Connections session from the November meeting as well NASA 
Headquarters reports on their perspectives for Venus Exploration and 
Venus Technology Development. Input on laboratory measurements needed 
to support the science objectives described in the VEXAG white paper 
will also be discussed.

As before, there will special science reports and opportunities for 
open mike presentations (1-2 slides, up to 10 minutes). If you wish 
to make an open mike presentation, please send an email with a title 
to Tommy Thompson: Thomas.W.Thompson@jpl.nasa.gov

Student participation is encouraged, and some travel funds will be 
available:

REMINDER - MARS EXPRESS OMEGA-HRSC DATA WORKSHOP

A 3-day Mars Express OMEGA-HRSC Data Workshop will be held on 
Wednesday, Thursday, Friday (May 21-23, 2008) at PDS Geosciences 
Node, Washington University, St. Louis in order to provide graduate 
students, post-doc's and other Mars investigators with a working 
knowledge of how to use the Mars Express OMEGA (Observatoire pour la 
Mineralogie, l'Eau, les Glaces et l'Activity) and HRSC (High 
Resolution Stereo Camera) data sets. This workshop will provide:

- Tutorials and hands-on with Mars Express data
- Explore data from ESA Planetary Science Archive
- Use data and tools with Instrument science teams

Workshop attendees are expected to supply their own computers equipped 
with IDL. Workshop attendance will be limited to 30. If interested in
