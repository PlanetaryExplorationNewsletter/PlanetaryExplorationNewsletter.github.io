[NASA] FINAL TEXT AND DUE DATES FOR OPPORTUNITIES IN SMD EDUCATION AND 
PUBLIC OUTREACH 

This solicitation is for investigations or projects utilizing SMD 
content supporting NASA education and public outreach objectives. It 
solicits proposals that address substantial and substantive educational 
needs or problems and offer solutions of significant impact. Projects 
are expected to be relevant to the NASA SMD Education portfolio. This 
relevance should be clearly demonstrated in the proposal. 

Given the many accomplishments in NASA Earth and space science 
education and public outreach in recent years, the program places 
particular emphasis on systemic and/or sustainable educational impact 
from SMD investments. Projects must have a clear linkage to the needs 
of the formal or informal educational systems. 

Notices of Intent to propose (NOIs) are due May 15, 2008, and 
proposals are due July 15, 2008.

Solicitations" then "NNH08ZDA001N").

OUTER PLANETS FLAGSHIP MISSION (OPAG) INSTRUMENT WORKSHOP

Monrovia, California
June 3-5, 2008

This is to announce a workshop to prepare instrument providers for an 
upcoming opportunity to propose instruments for an international Outer 
Planet Flagship Mission that is planned for a new start in fiscal 2009.  
NASA and ESA are planning towards opportunity announcements for 
scientific experiments to fly on the mission.  Currently, NASA and ESA 
are studying two mission options- a Europa/Jupiter System Mission 
(EJSM) and a Titan/Saturn System Mission (TSSM).  A decision by 
NASA/ESA is expected in November 2008 on whether EJSM or TSSM will go 
forward.

This workshop will provide overviews of both missions as well as 
overviews of the serious payload constraints that potential instrument 
providers will want to understand and incorporate into their future 
proposals.  In addition, the workshop solicits contributed papers from 
instrument providers to be presented in an extended poster session and 
summarized during the oral sessions. There is no registration fee for 
workshop participants.

The following URL will go live April 17 to accept registration and 
abstracts: http://opfm.jpl.nasa.gov/InstrumentWorkshop/

The deadline for online abstract submission is May 16.

VENUS EXPLORATION ANALYSIS GROUP (VEXAG) UPDATE

The Venus Exploration Analysis Group (VEXAG) recently published the
"Venus Exploration Goals, Objectives, Investigations, and Priorities
2007":

http://www.lpi.usra.edu/vexag/vexag_goals_2007.pdf.

In the next update of this report, VEXAG wishes to add a section that
identifies critical laboratory measurements needed to fulfill the
identified goals, objectives, and investigations.

REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI): PAYLOAD FLIGHT OPPORTUNITY FOR ODYSSEY 
MOON LIMITED M-1 LUNAR LANDER MISSION - DEADLINE EXTENDED

Release Date: March 11, 2008

Extended Response Date: April 21, 2008

On March 11th, 2008, at the 39th Lunar and Planetary Science 
Conference, Odyssey Moon Limited released a Request for Information
(RFI) for a Payload Flight Opportunity aboard its inaugural M-1 lunar 
lander mission.

Odyssey Moon is conducting this request for information (RFI) to 
survey interest in the international lunar community for this payload 
flight opportunity. Odyssey Moon seeks to identify potential payloads 
and Principal Investigators (PIs) who wish to explore rapid, low-cost 
lunar flight opportunities and will work with PI's to identify how 
such flight opportunities could be supported by national space 
agencies and other sources.  

Responses were originally requested by April 12th, 2008.  By popular 
demand the deadline has been extended to April 21, 2008.

Input from the international lunar science community is a vital part 
of our efforts and we very much appreciate the high level of community 
interest in our Commercial Mission of Opportunity.

The RFI can be downloaded at:

Questions and responses should be emailed to: PFO-M1@odysseymoon.com
