[NASA] NEW ROSES DUE DATES FOR PROGRAM ELEMENTS IMPACTED BY THE 
UNPLANNED UNAVAILABILITY OF NSPIRES

ROSES-08 Amendment 22:  New ROSES Dues Dates for Program Elements
impacted by the unplanned unavailability of NSPIRES

The NSPIRES system was unavailable from Thursday July 24, 2008, to
Tuesday July 29, 2008. New due dates are announced for ROSES program
elements whose Notice of Intent (NOI) to propose due date or proposal
due date were affected.

Appendix A.21: Advanced Component Technology: Proposals due August 4, 
2008.

Appendix A.26: IceSAT-II Science Definition team: Proposals due August
4, 2008.

Appendix A.27 SMAP Science Definition team: Proposals due August 1, 
2008.

Appendix B.9 Solar Dynamics Observatory Science Center: Proposals due
August 1, 2008.

Appendix C.17 Astrobiology: Exobiology and Evolutionary Biology: NOIs
due August 4, 2008.

On or about July 29, 2008, this Amendment to the NASA Research
Announcement "Research Opportunities in Space and Earth Sciences
(ROSES) 2008" (NNH08ZDA001N) will be posted on the NASA research
opportunity homepage at 

http://nspires.nasaprs.com/

(select "Solicitations" then "Open Solicitations" then "NNH08ZDA001N")

Questions concerning these program elements may be addressed to the
NASA POC identified in each ROSES Appendix. General questions
regarding ROSES may be addressed to:
Dr. Max Bernstein, Research Lead, Science Mission Directorate, NASA 
Headquarters, Washington, DC 20546-0001

[NASA] NEW PROPOSAL OPPORTUNITY: MOST U.S. GUEST OBSERVER PROGRAM -
CYCLE 1

ROSES Amendment 23 announces a new proposal opportunity in Appendix 
D.10 entitled "MOST U.S. Guest Observer (GO) Program - Cycle 1." 
This program element solicits proposals for the acquisition and 
analysis of data from the MOST (Microvariability and Oscillations of 
STars) observatory through a partnership between NASA and the Canadian
Space Agency.

Observations will begin on or around February 1, 2009 and awards will
have a 12-month duration. The MOST mission is designed for photometric
studies with high precision sufficient to perform stellar 
asteroseismology studies and other variability analyses of stars and
exoplanet systems. GO investigations may address any area of
astrophysics and are not restricted to asteroseismology. Investigations
may range from the study of single or many targets per field, and 
should optimize the amount of science that can be derived from a single
pointed observation (field).

Notices of Intent due August 29, 2008
Proposals due October 6, 2008

On or about July 31, 2008, this ROSES Amendment (NNH08ZDA001N) will be
posted on the NASA research opportunity homepage:

http://nspires.nasaprs.com/ 

(select "Solicitations" then "Open Solicitations" then "NNH08ZDA001N").

Questions may be addressed to Dr. Padi Boyd, 
Telephone:  (202) 358-2368; E-mail:  padi.boyd@nasa.gov.

THE GREAT PLANET DEBATE: SCIENCE AS PROCESS

Dear Colleagues,

You are cordially invited to "The Great Planet Debate" (GPD) 
conference at the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory 
August 14-16, 2008.

This includes two days of scientific sessions to discuss and debate
the processes leading to planetary formation and characteristics and 
various criteria by which planets can be defined and categorized. An 
educator's workshop follows on the third day, to discuss how the planet
debate can be used to explain science as a process.

The final program is now available at:

http://gpd.jhuapl.edu/schedule

The abstracts are posted at:

http://gpd.jhuapl.edu/abstracts

An open-to-the-public debate between Dr. Mark Sykes of the Planetary 
Science Institute and Dr. Neil deGrasse Tyson of the American Museum
of Natural History will start at 4:30 pm EDT on August 14th. The
debate, which will be moderated by Ira Flatow (the host of Science
Friday on National Public Radio) is free and will be streamed live on 
the web.

To register for web and in-person participation in the GPD conference,
go to

http://gpd.jhuapl.edu/

Hope to see you in a couple of weeks.

With best regards,

Hal Weaver (GPD LOC Chair)

GREAT PLANET DEBATE WEBCAST TEST INVITATION

The Great Planet Debate: Science as Process will be held at APL,
August 14 & 15, with an actual debate between Neil deGrasse Tyson
(American Museum of Natural History) and Mark Sykes (Planetary Science
Institute), moderated by Ira Flatow (NPR Science Friday). The invited
talks and the debate will be webcast live. The agenda is available at

http://gpd.jhuapl.edu/

On August 5, beginning at 1:30 PM EDT, APL will be testing the webcast
and you are invited to help. The link is:
 
mms://a1719.l711155718.c7111.n.lm.akamaistream.net/D/1719/7111/v0001/
reflector:55718
 
The more people sign on, the better the test analysis. You are asked  
to sign on for a minimum of 30 minutes between 2PM and 3PM EDT.
This will provide a good read on peak usage and number of viewers.
Outside of that window is fine as well, and APL is interested in
how things work in other parts of the World outside the US.

APL has scheduled a meeting place Help line for call ins during the
test.
 
The phone numbers for HELP are:
 
443.778.2200 Baltimore
240.228.2200 Washington
800.835.0936 Toll Free

The caller must enter the meeting ID: 344228

Someone will be on the line to help.

Thank you!

IAG PLANETARY GEOMORPHOLOGY IMAGE OF THE MONTH

The August 'Image of the month' is now available at the IAG's Planetary
Geomorphology web page

http://www.psi.edu/pgwg/images/aug08image.html

This month's topic is on Lava flows on Mars, Io and Earth

The images and information are a free educational resource provided to
encourage the inclusion of planetary geomorphology topics in 
curriculum. They are also intended to stimulate collaboration between 
geomorphologists studying Earth landforms and those who focus
primarily on other planetary surfaces.

If you would like to contribute an image (Earth analogs are welcome)
please contact mbourke@psi.edu

Past images and captions are available at

2008 AGU FALL MEETING SESSION: THE DYNAMIC LUNAR ENVIRONMENT

We are soliciting contributions on a variety of topics related to 
dynamic lunar processes. These include (but are not limited to) plasma
and electromagnetic fields, dust and neutral exosphere, impacts, 
seismic events, and coupling between these processes. We hope to review
the current state of knowledge, hear about exciting new advances from
research on existing data sets and those from the latest lunar 
missions, and discuss the future measurements and analyses needed to
understand fundamental processes in the dynamic lunar environment. 
We would be excited to hear about your research in this session, and we
encourage you to submit an abstract to what we believe will be a very
interesting and educational session.  The abstract submission deadline
for the AGU fall meeting is September 10th, and abstracts can be
submitted at

http://www.agu.org/meetings/fm08.

Please forward this announcement to any colleagues that you think would
be interested in this session, and please contact us if you have any
questions.

We hope that you can participate in this session.
