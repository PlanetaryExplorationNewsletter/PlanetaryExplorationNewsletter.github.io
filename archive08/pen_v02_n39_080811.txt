EDITOR NOTE: PEN Status

Some problems with the host server for PEN at planetarynews.org
resulted in the distribution of Sunday's newsletter failing. The
problem is being investigated. In the meantime, PEN will be emailed 
from a server at the Planetary Science Institute.

All user services at planetarynews.org are operating normally - the
website, archive, meeting calendar and subscription service.

Thank you for your patience.

ALTAIR SURVEY

All planetary astronomers who use (or would like to use) large 
ground-based telescopes are strongly encouraged to respond to the 
ALTAIR survey by THIS FRIDAY, 15 August. The short version takes 
10 minutes.

The survey is available at 

http://www.noao.edu/cgi-bin/altair/survey.pl 

It will provide input to the ALTAIR committee 
(http://www.noao.edu/system/altair/). This committee will make 
recommendations to NOAO and the NSF regarding the needs of the 
community, both currently and in the future, for resources associated 
with ground-based O/IR telescopes in the 6.5- to 10-m aperture range.

We would like to hear from astronomers in all stages of their careers.
So please spread the word and ask your colleagues, including graduate
students and postdocs, to fill out the survey as well.

FIRST CIRCULAR FOR THE 1ST CPS INTERNATIONAL SCHOOL OF
PLANETARY SCIENCES

"Dust in Space"
January 5 - 9, 2009

http://cps.scitec.kobe-u.ac.jp/~pschool/2009-01-05/

Location: Seapal Suma, Kobe, Japan.

Enrollment: 60 participants

Deadline for Application: September 22, 2008

We cordially invite young scientists to participate in the 1st CPS
International School of Planetary Science 2009. This school aims at
promoting education and research in planetary science for highly
motivated graduate students and young researchers worldwide. It will
offer them an opportunity to interact with leading scientists in a
specific scientific field of the year. The present school is the
heritage of the Kobe International Planetary School held under the
Kobe University 21 Century COE program.

This year's topic of the school will be "Dust in Space", reflecting
the coming retirement of Prof. Tadashi Mukai, who was the leader of
the 21th COE program "Origin and Evolution of Planetary Systems" and
is the most well-known Japanese scientist in cosmic dust
research. Internationally well-established experts in dust science
will review recent progress in our understandings of interstellar
dust, interplanetary dust, cometary dust, and dust in protoplanetary
disks and debris disks.
