[NASA PDS] PLANETARY IMAGE ATLAS RELEASE
 
The Planetary Data System (PDS) Imaging Node is pleased to announce a 
new release of the Planetary Image Atlas.
 
The Planetary Image Atlas provides a mechanism to quickly and 
intuitively query the distributed databases and data repositories that
represent the Imaging Node's holdings for PDS.  The evolution of the 
Atlas system continues with this release, including these updates: 
Access to the Mars Odyssey/THEMIS and Mars Express/HRSC data sets; 
improvements to the user interface and experience; addition of a bulk
download option; improved user HELP through an introductory demo; 
expanded mission-specific and multi-mission search capabilities; and 
for Mars missions, a Map interface and the integration of the USGS 
Flagstaff's Uniform Planetary Coordinate System to ensure consistency 
of geographic location across missions.
 
To access the Planetary Image Atlas, please visit the following link:
 
http://pds-imaging.jpl.nasa.gov/search
 
Because the Planetary Image Atlas is an evolving tool for scientists, 
it's important for us to hear from you as we continue to add data and 
evolve system capabilities. Please send your feedback to 
Sue.LaVoie@jpl.nasa.gov

HOLD THAT DATE!

Women in Astronomy and Space Science: Meeting the challenges of an 
increasingly diverse scientific work place", Oct 21-23, 2009, College 
Park, MD.
 
Goddard Space Flight Center will be hosting a meeting October 21 - 23,
2009 at the University of Maryland Conference Center on the topic of 
women in astronomy and space science with a focus on not only gender,
but also on generation and minorities.  Co-hosts are the National 
Science Foundation, University of Maryland, AAS, EAS, STScI, NGST, 
and others. The topics include: 1) statistics on the state of the 
field, establishing trends over the last 15 years including the  
"longitudinal studies" of age vs. makeup of the field and identifying
areas for celebration or for concern; 2) research on the impact of 
gender/ generational/ cultural differences in the science workforce 
with a focus on practical solutions, 3) issues concerning the work 
environment and best practices for success of scientists in a diverse
work force, and 4) special sessions on the issues of minorities in 
science, and women in Earth Science.  
 
We hope you will join us.  More information will be posted on our 
website as it becomes available:

SPECIAL ISSUE: EXPLORING OTHER WORLDS BY EXPLORING OUR OWN: THE ROLE 
OF TERRESTRIAL ANALOGUE STUDIES IN PLANETARY EXPLORATION

Dear colleagues,

It is with great pleasure that I can announce that the thematic volume
of Planetary and Space Science (PSS) entitled "Exploring other worlds
by exploring our own: The role of terrestrial analogue studies in 
planetary exploration" is now open for submissions. Our goal of this 
volume is to highlight some of the recent cutting-edge research in 
the fields of Comparative Planetary Geology and Geomorphology, 
Astrobiology, and Exploration Science and Technologies for 
Exploration.

On behalf of the other Guest Editors (Neil Banerjee, Richard Soare, 
and Marie-Claude Williamson), myself, and the PSS editorial board, we 
invite you to submit manuscripts on any of the above topics. Papers 
should be submitted via the journal's submission site: 

http://ees.elsevier.com/pss/ 

Please ensure that you select the Article Type "SPECIAL ISSUE: 
Osinski-Analogue" when submitting your paper. The deadline for 
submissions is January 2009, with publication of the issue planned for 
Fall 2009.

All the best,
Oz
