NASA EARTH AND SPACE SCIENCE FELLOWSHIP (NESSF) PROGRAM

NASA announces a call for graduate fellowship proposals to the NASA 
Earth and Space Science Fellowship (NESSF) program for the 2009-2010 
academic year.  This call solicits applications from accredited U.S. 
universities on behalf of individuals pursuing Master of Science 
(M.Sc.) or Doctoral (Ph.D.) degrees in Earth and space sciences, or 
related disciplines. The purpose of NESSF is to ensure continued 
training of a highly qualified workforce in disciplines needed to 
achieve NASA's scientific goals. 

Awards resulting from the competitive selection will be made in the 
form of training grants to the respective universities.

The deadline for NEW applications is February 3, 2009.
The deadline for RENEWAL applications is March 16, 2009.

solid Earth geophysics and planetary sciences. We seek exceptional 
scientists and educators who work with theoretical, laboratory or 
observational approaches, and have a broad view of Earth and 
planetary systems. We anticipate hiring one candidate in each of the 
subject areas, but also encourage applicants who contribute to both 
disciplines.
 
Candidates should submit an application form and supporting material

OPTIMIZING SCIENCE AND EXPLORATION WORKING GROUP (OSEWG) WEBSITE

The Optimizing Science and Exploration Working Group (OSEWG) now has a
publicly accessible website:

http://www.lpi.usra.edu/osewg/.  

The OSEWG is a collaborative effort of NASA's Exploration Systems 
Mission Directorate (ESMD) and the Science Mission Directorate (SMD),
with participation of the Space Operations Mission Directorate (SOMD).
Its purpose is to engage in mission concept planning and science 
requirements definition to help inform the development of systems that
will optimize exploration and science investigations for human and
robotic exploration on the Moon and beyond.

On the website we have made available the OSEWG charter and other
organizational documents as well as past presentations.  The site will
continue to be updated and expanded as OSEWG grows and evolves to keep
the lunar science and exploration communities informed of our 
activities and to provide opportunities for involvement and feedback.

PLANETARY GEOMORPHOLOGY IMAGE OF THE MONTH

The November 'Image of the month' is now available at the IAG's
Planetary Geomorphology web page

http://www.psi.edu/pgwg/images/nov08image.html

This month's topic is about outflow channels on Mars

The images and information are a free educational resource provided to
encourage the inclusion of planetary geomorphology topics in curriculum.
They are also intended to stimulate collaboration between
geomorphologists studying Earth landforms and those who focus primarily
on other planetary surfaces.

If you would like to contribute an image (Earth analogs are welcome)
please contact mbourke@psi.edu

Past images and captions are available at
