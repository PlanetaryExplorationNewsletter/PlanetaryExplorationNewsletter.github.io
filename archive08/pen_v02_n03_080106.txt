[NASA] MESSAGE FROM THE SENIOR ADVISOR FOR RESEARCH & ANALYSIS (SARA),
YVONNE PENDLETON

The most recent updates to the SARA webpage have just been made. Go to
http://science.hq.nasa.gov/research/sara.html 

A list of page changes can be found at 
http://science.hq.nasa.gov/research/sara_whats_new.html

Dear Colleagues,

Happy New Year. May this be a year of new discoveries for us all!

If you have not already seen it, please go to the front page of the 
website today to read the New Year's message from our Associate 
Administrator, Alan Stern [Editor: previously distributed on PEN,
January 4]. It provides a very nice summary of some of the 
accomplishments so far, along with insight into our commitment to 
do much more as the days go by.

As for my own efforts on this website, I am continuing to develop new 
pages and to populate the current pages with information you need to 
know. Among other new updates, this issue brings you, a letter from 
the Division Director for Planetary Science, Jim Green, explaining the 
effect of the NASA budget passage on the R & A funding in his division, 
the New York Times link to an article describing Alan Stern's 
leadership of the Science Mission Directorate, and a list of NASA 
officials who will be present at the NASA booth during the upcoming 
American Astronomical Society Meeting. As always, the What's new page 
tells you all the changes that have been made since the last update.

I will be at the AAS meeting next week, so I hope to see some of you 
there. The NASA Townhall meeting is Tuesday. Please do not miss it if 
you have the chance to attend. Jon Morse, the Division Director for 
Astrophysics, John Mather (SMD Chief Scientist), Alan Stern and I will 
all be there to answer questions. We look forward to listening to you.

Warm Wishes for a wonderful 2008,

Yvonne

EARLY PLANETARY SCIENCE OPPORTUNITIES ON SOFIA - MONDAY JANUARY 7, AAS

There will be a splinter session at the Austin American Astronomical
Society meeting to explore early science opportunities with the SOFIA 
observatory.  One of the working groups will focus on planetary science 
and as Chair of the working group I would like to extend an invitation 
to any planetary scientist who may be attending the AAS meeting to 
participate in the SOFIA splinter session.  The session will be held 
on Monday, January 7 from 1 to 5 p.m.  If you have any questions please 
contact me at Black@lpi.usra.edu.

2008 LPI SUMMER INTERN PROGRAM ANNOUNCEMENT

The Lunar and Planetary Institute is offering undergraduate students 
with 50 semester credit hours or more the chance to experience 
cutting-edge research in lunar and planetary science.

Student interns will get to work one-on-one with scientists from the 
LPI or NASA's Johnson Space Center to conduct research on projects of 
current interest to the lunar and planetary science community. This 
10-week program will allow students the opportunity to work with and 
learn from some of the best lunar and planetary scientists in the 
field.

Please pass this information on to any of your students who might be 
interested.

Application Deadline: January 25, 2008

ENVIRONMENTS AND CONSEQUENCES OF IMPACTS OF ASTEROIDS AND COMETS

Birger Schmitz, Christian Koeberl, Maurits Lindstrom, Jens Ormo 
(symposium PIS-03)

Impact cratering is now recognized as one of the most important 
geological processes in our Solar System, and this symposium allows an 
integrated approach to a broad spectrum of impact-related issues, such 
as effects on the biota and climate locally and worldwide, frequencies 
and variations in the type of impacts, crater formation processes, 
crater identification, comparisons with other planets and much more. 
This is a vivid and exciting research field where major developments 
take place at a rapid pace. In particular, Scandinavia has the greatest 
concentration on Earth of recognized impact structures vs. area. Some 
of the most interesting extraterrestrial signatures in the sedimentary 
strata also occur here, such as the Cretaceous-Tertiary boundary clay 
in Denmark, and abundant mid-Ordovician fossil meteorites in southern 
Sweden.

Abstract deadline is February 29, 2008.  

For registration and full information on the IGC Oslo, please use the 
website:

The PIS-03 symposium will be in the second part (August 10-14) of the 
IGC33 meeting.
