POSTDOCTORAL OPPORTUNITIES IN PLANETARY SCIENCE AT GSFC

Preferred Deadline: November 1st 2008

The NASA Goddard Space Flight Center Planetary Systems Lab (Code 693)
is seeking qualified applicants for the NASA Postdoctoral Program.
Personnel in our group study many of the bodies in the solar system
and extra-solar planets.  We particularly seek applicants interested
in the study of the atmospheres of the outer planets, especially
atmospheric dynamics and cloud structure.  Experience in radiative
transfer or dynamical modeling (including wave propagation) is a plus.
Researchers will have access to data from Galileo, Cassini, New
Horizons, the Hubble Space Telescope and other facilities.

To apply, see http://university.gsfc.nasa.gov/programs/npp.jsp, and
also contact Amy Simon-Miller (Amy.Simon@nasa.gov, or at the DPS
meeting, October 10-15, Ithaca NY) for more information and to develop 
a research focus.

STUDENT OPPORTUNITIES IN PLANETARY SCIENCE AT GSFC AND/OR JPL

A collaborative planetary group with members at Goddard Space Flight
Center and JPL seek students interested in the decomposition of
multivariate data sets to understand the atmosphere of Jupiter and
other planets.

Applicants can be hosted at either location (GSFC in Greenbelt, MD,
or JPL in Pasadena, CA), through our undergraduate and graduate student
programs, especially the Co-op, USRP and GSRP programs:

At GSFC:

Contact: Amy Simon-Miller at GSFC (Amy.Simon@nasa.gov) or
Padma Yanamandra-Fisher at JPL (padma@scn.jpl.nasa.gov).  They
will also be at the DPS meeting, October 10-15, Ithaca NY.

FELLOWSHIP PROGRAMS REMINDER

We want to remind any graduate students and postdocs who were planning
to apply for a Spitzer Fellowship, with general information at

http://ssc.spitzer.caltech.edu/geninfo/fellows/

that they should be applying for Hubble Fellowships, with information 
at

http://www.stsci.edu/institute/org/spd/hubble-fellowship
/hubble-fellow-overview/

Einstein Fellowships, at

http://cxc.harvard.edu/fellows/

or the new Sagan Fellowships, at

http://nexsci.caltech.edu/sagan/

The Sagan Fellowship program, in particular, supports exoplanet
research, a very active field of Spitzer research.

PLANETARY GEOMORPHOLOGY SESSIONS AT 7TH IAG CONFERENCE

Abstract submission deadline: 
Wednesday 3 December 2008 (Australia time).

Please consider presenting your work in the special sessions on 
Planetary Geomorphology to be held at the Seventh IAG Conference on 
Geomorphology, Melbourne, July 2009. 
http://www.geomorphology2009.com/default.asp

We welcome submissions for oral and poster presentations on topics 
relevant to the geomorphology of terrestrial planets and bodies, 
including studies of Earth analogs.

WORKSHOP ON OBSERVING WITH SOFIA

5:00 to 6:30 p.m., Monday, October 13, 2008
During the Ithaca DPS meeting
Location:  Taylor A/B

A brief workshop will be offered to the planetary science community
regarding SOFIA, NASA's Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared
Astronomy, Monday October 13, 5:00 to 6:30 p.m. during the Ithaca
DPS meeting, in room Taylor A/B.

SOFIA's first scientific observing flights are expected in mid-2009.
Presentations will be made during the workshop about status of the
SOFIA program, capabilities of the observatory and its 9 scientific
instruments spanning the wavelength range from UV to sub-mm, and the
mission E&PO program.  Upcoming opportunities to apply for SOFIA
observing time will be described.  A draft "white paper" on planetary
science possibilities with SOFIA will be summarized, for discussion by
attendees.

[NASA] REVISED OBJECTIVES AND NEW DUE DATE FOR LASER

LASER will not be co-sponsored by the Exploration Systems Mission 
Directorate (ESMD) this year; LASER is sponsored only by the Science 
Mission Directorate (SMD) this year. Objectives that support only 
lunar exploration without supporting lunar science are not being 
solicited this year.

In order to allow sufficient time for proposals to be prepared in 
response to this change, the proposal due date has been deferred to 
November 7, 2008.

LASER awards in response to the ROSES 2007 call were jointly 
supported by SMD and ESMD. These awards will continue to be jointly 
supported until conclusion of the award term.

Proposers who have already submitted proposals may use the NSPIRES 
"withdraw" function to withdraw their proposal, revise it, and 
resubmit it if they desire. Questions about this NSPIRES function may 
be directed to the NSPIRES help desk.

Further information about this program element is available from Dr. 
Robert A. Fogel, Planetary Science Division, Science Mission 
Directorate, NASA Headquarters, Washington, DC 20546-0001; Telephone: 
202-358-2289; E-mail: Robert.a.fogel@nasa.gov.

[NASA] REQUEST FOR INFORMATION FOR THE SCIENTIST PARTICIPANT SUBORBITAL
RESEARCH PROGRAM

Deadline: December 5, 2008

NASA is soliciting ideas and comments from the science, research, and 
technology communities on potential suborbital investigations with the 
option of, but not limited to, a "human in the loop" that support any 
of NASA's goals. With input from responses to this RFI, NASA intends 
to (i) consider acquiring commercial suborbital seats and/or flights 
for NASA-funded researchers to conduct suborbital investigations and 
(ii) consider an additional solicitation for proposals for suborbital 
investigation concept studies that address NASA's research needs, 
especially those in science disciplines beyond those included in the 
current ROSES-08 solicitation. For an overview of NASAâ€™s strategic 
goals and objectives refer to The 2006 NASA Strategic Plan (2006), 
available at 

http://www.nasa.gov/about/budget

The complete RFI including background, requested information, and 
instructions for responding may be found at 

http://nspires.nasaprs.com/ 

Select "Solicitations" then "Open Solicitations" then "Request for 
Information (NNH08ZDA011L) Scientist Participant Suborbital Research 
Program.

For further information on the Science Participant Suborbital Research 
Program, please contact Dr Yvonne Cagle, Mail Code VP, NASA Ames 
Research Center, Mountain View, CA 94035; phone at 281-244-8628; email
