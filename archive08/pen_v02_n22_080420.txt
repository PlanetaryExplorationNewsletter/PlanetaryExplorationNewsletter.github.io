[NASA] ALLOWING 3-YEAR PROPOSALS FOR JDAP AND CDAP

Three year proposals are now allowed for the Jupiter Data Analysis
program (JDAP) described in Appendix C.9 and for the Cassini Data
Analysis program (CDAP) described in Appendix C.10. This amendment
increases the maximum duration of awards from two years to three
years for both JDAP and CDAP. As this change has been made after
Notices of Intent to propose (NOIs) are due, there is no expectation
or requirement that new or amended NOIs will be submitted.

No change has been made in the proposal due dates for these programs.
For JDAP, proposals are due on May 15, 2008. For CDAP, proposals are
due on May 30, 2008.

[NASA] NEW COOPERATIVE AGREEMENT OPPORTUNITY, NASA OFFICE OF EDUCATION

The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Office of
Education invites proposals to develop, pilot, and administer the
Endeavor Science Teachers Certificate Program (ESTCP), a competitive,
high-quality, national program for pre/in-service teachers. The NASA
Office of Education will provide the technical coordination of this
solicitation. The Endeavor Science Teachers Certificate Program will
provide one (1) year fellowships, and unique education and technical
experiences leading to teacher certification centered on NASA unique
science and mathematics content.

Organizations eligible to respond to this CAN are limited to higher
education institutions, nonprofit organizations, or consortia of
organizations and institutions serving students and teachers.
Partnerships within these institutions and/or organizations are
encouraged to apply.  Proposals from entities outside the United
States will not be considered.

Electronically submitted Notices of Intent to propose are requested
by May 9, 2008. Proposal due date is June 17, 2008. 

Questions about this may be directed to Dr. Bernice Alston,
Office of Education, NASA Headquarters, Washington, DC

ELS-XI (ELECTROMAGNETIC AND LIGHT SCATTERING CONFERENCE - 11)

University of Hertfordshire, UK: 7-12 Sept 2008

http://www.els-xi-08.org

The main objective of this meeting, very popular among the planetary
scientists who study cosmic dust and planetary aerosols, is to bring
together scientists and engineers researching various aspects of 
light scattering. The specific topics to be covered include (but are 
not limited to) new theoretical developments and numerical
simulations of light scattering by nonspherical particles and
particles with complex structures; laboratory and field experiments
in light scattering by natural and artificial particles; applications
of light scattering in particle detection, laboratory and field 
particle characterization; single and multiple light scattering in 
various cosmic objects, including interplanetary and comet dust, and
aerosols in atmospheres of planets and exoplanets.

Would those attending the ELS-XI conference please note that Early 
Bird Registration closes on April 25, 2008. The cost of registration
will increase by 50 GBP (approximately US$100) after this date.

VENUS EXPLORATION AND ANALYSIS GROUP

The exploration of Venus remains an extremely promising avenue for 
understanding how terrestrial planets work.  Acknowledging the 
scientific promise of Venus exploration, NASA created the Venus 
Exploration and Analysis Group (VEXAG) 

http://www.lpi.usra.edu/vexag/ 

and the Venus Science and Technology Definition Team (VSTDT).   For 
those interested in contributing to a community-based analysis of 
Venus exploration science,  attendance at this 5th VEXAG workshop at 
the Marriott Inn and Conference Center, University of Maryland, 
Adelphi, Maryland on May 7 and 8 is a must.  The Venus STDT, which 
is defining a Venus flagship mission for the 2020-2025 timeframe, 
meets the prior 2 days, May 5 and 6. Venus STDT goals, activities, 
process, and progress will be discussed at the VEXAG workshop.  It is 
eagerly seeking input and feedback from the community at the VEXAG 
meeting.

JOIN THE NASA TEAM AT THE JET PROPULSION LABORATORY 

Dear Colleague-

The Navigation and Ancillary Information Facility (NAIF) team at
NASA/JPL is looking for a new or recent (no more than three years
out) graduate who has the rather eclectic skills and interest to
become a full time, permanent member of the NAIF Group - the home of
NASA's "SPICE" ancillary information system development.

More about NAIF and the SPICE system may be seen at:
 
http://naif.jpl.nasa.gov 

Required skills include: MA/MS in Applied Math or engineering field 
suited to space exploration with 0-3 years of experience or BA/BS in
similar disciplines with 0-5 years experience. Practical applied math 
or engineering skills appropriate to NASAs SPICE activity.

Candidate must be a U.S. citizen or permanent resident. 

For full details and to apply see:
