[NASA] DEADLINE EXTENDED FOR SPACE BIOLOGY

Due to the hardship caused by Hurricane Ike to institutions on the
Gulf Coast, NASA is again extending the deadline for the NASA
Research Announcement NNH08ZTT003N NRA: Research Opportunities for
Fundamental Space Biology Investigations in Microbial, Plant and Cell
Biology from September 19, 2008 to September 24, 2008.

WORKSHOP ON OBSERVING WITH SOFIA

5:00 to 6:30 p.m., Monday, October 13, 2008
during the Ithaca DPS meeting
location:  Taylor A/B

A brief workshop will be offered to the planetary science community
regarding SOFIA, NASA's Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared
Astronomy, Monday October 13, 5:00 to 6:30 p.m. during the Ithaca 
DPS meeting, in room Taylor A/B.

SOFIA's first scientific observing flights are expected in mid-2009.  
Presentations will be made during the workshop about status of the 
SOFIA program, capabilities of the observatory and its 9 scientific
instruments spanning the wavelength range from UV to sub-mm, and the
mission E&PO program.  Upcoming opportunities to apply for SOFIA
observing time will be described.  A draft "white paper" on planetary
science possibilities with SOFIA will be summarized, for discussion by
attendees.

13TH ISSUE OF JOURNAL FOCUSING ON ASTRONOMY EDUCATION NOW AVAILABLE

Astronomy Education Review (AER), the web-based journal/magazine about
astronomy education and outreach, announces the on-line publication of
its 13th issue, now complete on the Web at:
 
http://aer.noao.edu 

When you go to the AER site, you will see that the next issue is 
already under way. You can find the full 13th issue by clicking on 
"back issues" and then on "vol. 7, no. 1."

AER actively solicits interesting papers and articles on all aspects 
of astronomy education and outreach. The journal gets between 
130,000 and 270,000 hits per month from every state of the U.S. and 
over 90 other countries.  All papers are refereed and a set of
guidelines for contributing to AER is available on the web site.

We are also delighted to announce that, as of 2009, AER will become
a journal of the American Astronomical Society.  The transition
should be seamless and we continue to accept papers and announcement
for publication in either the last issue of 2008 or the first issue
of 2009.  More information will be available in the months to come.
