[NASA] SEVERAL ROSES DUE DATES EXTENDED

This amendment delays the proposal due dates for three program
elements of ROSES-2008:

Earth Science for Decision Making: Gulf of Mexico Region 
(Appendix A.28)
Outer Planets Research (Appendix C.7)
Astrobiology: Exobiology and Evolutionary Biology (Appendix C.17).

These due dates are being delayed in recognition of the severe 
difficulties that our colleagues in the Gulf of Mexico region are 
experiencing due to recent hurricanes.

Outer Planets Research (Appendix C.7) is also being delayed by two 
weeks to accommodate a delay in announcing selection decisions for 
some proposals submitted last year and to avoid conflicts with the 40th
meeting of the Division for Planetary Sciences.

The new due dates are:
Earth Science for Decision Making: Gulf of Mexico Region, October 30,
2008.
Outer Planets Research, November 14, 2008.
Astrobiology: Exobiology and Evolutionary Biology, September 26, 2008.

[NASA] CHANGE IN PROPOSAL DUE DATE FOR NNH08ZTT003N NRA: RESEARCH 
OPPORTUNITIES FOR FUNDAMENTAL SPACE BIOLOGY INVESTIGATIONS IN 
MICROBIAL, PLANT AND CELL BIOLOGY

Due to the hardship caused by Hurricane Ike to institutions on the Gulf
Coast, NASA is extending the deadline for the NASA Research 
Announcement NNH08ZTT003N, "Research Opportunities for Fundamental 
Space Biology Investigations in Microbial, Plant and Cell Biology" 
from September 15, 2008 to September 19, 2008.  

Please note that no further extensions will be granted.

VENUS GEOCHEMISTRY: PROGRESS, PROSPECTS, AND NEW MISSIONS

February 23-24, 2009. 
Lunar and Planetary Institute, Houston, Texas
http://www.lpi.usra.edu/meetings/venus2009/

Venus is fundamentally different from the Earth in geology, tectonics 
and internal processes, and atmosphere composition and dynamics. These
differences contain clues to the evolution of Earth's geology/climate
system, Earth's current habitability, and the detectability and 
habitability of planets circling other stars.
 
Given the limited knowledge about Venus' geochemistry, along with 
NASA's recent interest in Venus, as demonstrated in the recent Venus 
Science and Technology Definition Team study, the Venus Geochemistry 
workshop seeks to:

* assess current knowledge of Venus' geochemistry.
* consider Earth-based to enhance understanding of current data and
  enable future investigations.
* explore concepts for spacecraft instruments and missions.
* energize the Venus geochemistry community in preparation for future 
  spacecraft investigations.

To support these objectives, workshop sessions will focus on:

* present knowledge of Venus' geochemistry: atmosphere, surface, 
  mantle, and core.
* chemical interactions between Venus' surface and atmosphere.
* laboratory investigations (solids, fluids, gases) to further
  understanding of Venus' geochemistry.
* recent Venus missions and remote sensing of its surface and interior.
* geochemistry on future missions to Venus: concepts, investigations, 
  and instruments.
