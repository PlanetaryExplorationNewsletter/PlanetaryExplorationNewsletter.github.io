[NASA] FINAL TEXT FOR MOON AND MARS ANALOG MISSION ACTIVITIES (MMAMA)

This amendment replaces the draft text in Appendix C.24 entitled
"Moon and Mars Analog Mission Activities" with the final text. NASA
Moon and Mars Analog Mission Activities (MMAMA) research addresses
the need for integrated interdisciplinary field experiments as an
integral part of preparation for planned human and robotic missions
to the Moon and Mars. The focus of this program is on providing
high-fidelity scientific investigations, scientific input, and
science operations constraints in the context of planetary field
campaigns. Funding provided in this program element is intended to
enable researchers to conduct scientific investigations and integrate
their instruments, projects, and/or protocols into field activities
designed to help NASA plan for future exploration of the Moon, Mars,
and other planetary bodies with both robots and humans.

Notices of Intent to propose (NOIs) are due January 16, 2009, and
proposals are due February 20, 2009.

This AO will be posted on the NASA research opportunity homepage at:

http://nspires.nasaprs.com/ 

(select "Solicitations" then "Open Solicitations" then 
"NNH08ZDA001N").

NEXT MEETING OF THE VENUS EXPLORATION ANALYSIS GROUP

The next meeting of the Venus Exploration Analysis Group (VEXAG) will 
be February 25, 2009 at the Lunar and Planetary Institute in Houston, 
Texas. Please visit the VEXAG website to register for the meeting:

http://www.lpi.usra.edu/vexag/

The results of the Venus Flagship Science and Technology Definition
Team will be presented, and the exploration goals, objectives, and 
critical measurement requirements for Venus exploration will be
updated in preparation for the upcoming NRC Decadal Survey. VEXAG
is NASA's community-based forum designed to provide scientific input
and technology development plans for planning and prioritizing the 
exploration of Venus over the next several decades.

The Venus Geochemistry workshop will follow VEXAG on Feb 26-27, 2009 
at the Gilruth Center at NASA-JSC.

DECADAL SURVEY FOR THE PLANETARY SCIENCES

The National Research Council's Space Studies Board has received a 
request from NASA and NSF to initiate a new decadal survey for the 
planetary sciences. The planning for this activity will be discussed 
in a town hall session at the American Geophysical Union meeting in 
San Francisco on Thursday, 18 December.  The town hall is currently 
scheduled to start at 6:15 p.m. and will be held in Moscone West, 
Room 3018.

Call for Session Proposals

2009 GSA Annual Meeting
18-21 October 2009, Portland, Oregon, USA

Proposal deadline 11:59 pm, Tuesday January 6, 2009

We invite members of the planetary community to submit their ideas 
for Technical Sessions for the 2009 GSA Annual meeting in Portland, 
Oregon. Although the theme of the meeting if "Volcanoes to Vineyards: 
Living with Dynamic Landscapes", we encourage session proposals on 
ALL aspects of Lunar and Planetary Geology (and Geophysics).

Sessions can be proposed for sponsorship by the GSA Planetary 
Division alone, or can be submitted jointly with other GSA Divisions.
You do not need to be a member of GSA to submit a technical session 
proposal. Proposals from students are particularly encouraged; 
successful session convenors may be eligable for a Planetary Division 
Student Travel Award.

For more information please contact one of the GSA Planetary Division 
Officers: Louise Prockter (Louise.Prockter@jhuapl.edu), Jayne Aubele
(jayne.aubele@state.nm.us), Dave Williams (David.Williams@asu.edu) or 
Bob Anderson (robert.c.anderson@jpl.nasa.gov), or see the GSA website:
