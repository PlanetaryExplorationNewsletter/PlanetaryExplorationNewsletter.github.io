[NASA] LUNAR DUST DETECTOR INSTRUMENT OPPORTUNITY ADDED TO SALMON AO

The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Stand Alone 
Missions of Opportunity Notice (SALMON), is intended to provide 
opportunities for science and technology investigations on space flight
missions that advance the high priority science, technology, and 
exploration objectives of NASA's four Mission Directorates. 

This five-year omnibus Announcement of Opportunity (AO) incorporates 
Program Element Appendices (PEAs) for general Mission of Opportunity 
(MO) proposal opportunities as well as focused proposal opportunities
for specific flight opportunities.

A new PEA will be added to the AO presenting a Focused Opportunity for
an in-situ lunar dust detector instrument to be placed on the Lunar 
Atmosphere and Dust Environment Explorer (LADEE) mission. The LADEE
mission is a small focused mission intended to explore the tenuous 
lunar atmosphere and dust environment before that environment is 
altered by extended human activity on the Moon.  
 
NASA expects this PEA will be released along with the final version of
the SALMON AO no later than August 2008.

The SALMON draft AO can be viewed at

select Solicitations, Closed Solicitations, then SALMON DRAFT 

Further information about the LADEE mission will be made available in 
the SALMON reference library at

JOB OPPORTUNITY: RESEARCH ASSOCIATE, PLANETARY SURFACE PROCESSES, 
ORIGIN, EVOLUTION AND PALAEOHYDROLOGY OF THE OUTFLOW CHANNELS ON MARS
USING HRSC 3-D IMAGING.

Department of Earth Science and Engineering, Imperial College

Applications are invited for a Research Associate to work within a 
research programme on the geomorphology and geology of the Martian
outflow channels, under the direction of Dr Sanjeev Gupta (Department
of Earth Science and Engineering) and Dr Neil McIntyre (Department of
Civil and Environmental Engineering). The position, a fixed term
appointment available for up to 3 years, is available to start on
1st October 2008.

You will join a collaborative project with University College London
concerned with reconstructing the geological evolution of the Martian
outflow channels and the processes responsible for their formation.
The project will use new regional-scale Digital Terrain Models of
outflow channels, built primarily using stereo imagery from the High
Resolution Stereo Camera (HRSC) onboard the ESA Mars Express mission.

The work will be carried out in association with Professor Jan-Peter
Muller (UCL-MSSL) and Jeremy Morley (Civil, Environmental and
Geomatic Engineering, UCL).

Further information can be obtained from Sanjeev Gupta, 
s.gupta@imperial.ac.uk.
