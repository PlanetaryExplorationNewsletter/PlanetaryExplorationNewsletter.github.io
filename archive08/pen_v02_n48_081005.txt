[NASA] NEW PROPOSAL OPPORTUNITIES FOR EDUCATION AND PUBLIC OUTREACH

This amendment announces proposal opportunities for Education and
Public Outreach supplemental awards. Principal Investigators (PIs) of
selected Science Mission Directorate (SMD) research investigations
may propose for Education or Outreach awards as supplements to their
research award.

Note: Two major changes have been made to the supplemental E/PO award
opportunity compared to ROSES-2007 and earlier. (i) Two different
pathways are offered: $15K education pathway proposals and $10K
outreach pathway proposals. (ii) There is a specific proposal due
date, and proposals are submitted through NSPIRES.

Proposals for supplemental E/PO awards are due December 15, 2008.
Notices of Intent (NOIs) to propose are not requested.

On or about October 3, 2008, this Amendment to the NASA Research
Announcement "Research Opportunities in Space and Earth Sciences
(ROSES) 2008" (NNH08ZDA001N) will be posted on the NASA research
opportunity homepage at: 

http://nspires.nasaprs.com/ 

(Select "Solicitations" then "Open Solicitations" then "NNH08ZDA001N").

Questions concerning the Supplemental Education/Outreach Awards for
ROSES Investigators may be addressed to Dr. Larry P. Cooper,
Tel: 202-358-1531; E-mail: larry.p.cooper@nasa.gov.

[NASA PDS] NASAVIEW 3.2.0 RELEASE

The Planetary Data System (PDS) is pleased to announce a new delivery
of NASAView, version 3.2.0.

This maintenance release of NASAView includes support for 64-bit 
Linux platforms as well as corrections for issues discovered in 
previous releases. These corrections include a larger more readable 
histogram window, fixes for displaying MGS MOLA and MOC images 
properly and better recognition of TABLE-type objects when selecting 
them from the hierarchy menu. Due to platform incompatibilities and 
its general uselessness, the help menu feature has been replaced with 
a general information pop-up window. All available documentation for 
NASAView is supplied with each download package in PDF and HTML form.

To access the Nasaview software, please visit the following link:

REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS:  LUNAR CRATER OBSERVATION AND SENSING SATELLITE
(LCROSS) OBSERVATION CAMPAIGN

The Universities Space Research Association (USRA) is issuing a 
Request for Proposals (RFP) for participation in the USRA-NASA 
sponsored Lunar CRater Observation and Sensing Satellite (LCROSS) 
Observation Campaign.

USRA is working with NASA's Ames Research Center (ARC) and George C. 
Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) to coordinate the Observation 
Campaign for LCROSS. The Observation Campaign is designed to provide 
funding to qualified observers who have time on appropriate 
observatories to take measurements that will validate and complement 
measurements taken by the Shepherding Spacecraft and other assets. 
The RFP being issued by USRA is open to all qualified observers and 
is intended to fund a number of proposals that address LCROSS Science 
Goals. 

To download the RFP please visit: 

http://www.usra.edu/ 
or 
http://lcross.arc.nasa.gov  

Proposals are due 30 October 2008.

Contact:  Jennifer Heldmann at NASA Ames Research Center 
(Jennifer.heldmann@nasa.gov) or email LCROSS@usra.edu.

GEOMORPHOLOGY IMAGE OF THE MONTH

The October 'Image of the month' is now available at the IAG's 
Planetary Geomorphology web page 

http://www.psi.edu/pgwg/images/oct08image.html

This month's topic is on deltaic sediments on Mars.

The images and information are a free educational resource provided 
to encourage the inclusion of planetary geomorphology topics in 
curriculum. They are also intended to stimulate collaboration
between geomorphologists studying Earth landforms and those who 
focus primarily on other planetary surfaces.

If you would like to contribute an image (Earth analogs are welcome)
please contact mbourke@psi.edu

Past images and captions are available at

WORKSHOP ON OBSERVING WITH SOFIA

5:00 to 6:30 p.m., Monday, October 13, 2008
During the Ithaca DPS meeting
Location:  Taylor A/B

A brief workshop will be offered to the planetary science community 
regarding SOFIA, NASA's Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared 
Astronomy, Monday October 13, 5:00 to 6:30 p.m. during the Ithaca DPS 
meeting, in room Taylor A/B.

SOFIA's first scientific observing flights are expected in mid-2009. 
Presentations will be made during the workshop about status of the 
SOFIA program, capabilities of the observatory and its 9 scientific 
instruments spanning the wavelength range from UV to sub-mm, and the 
mission's E&PO program.  Upcoming opportunities to apply for SOFIA 
observing time will be described.  A draft "white paper" on planetary 
science possibilities with SOFIA will be summarized, for discussion by 
attendees.

by the Composite Infrared Spectrometer (CIRS) on the Cassini Saturn 
orbiter spacecraft.

The position is a two-year appointment in the first instance, with 
the possibility of extension depending on the success of future 
grant proposals. For further information on this position, including
qualifications required and application details see:
