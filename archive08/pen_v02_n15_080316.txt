Europa - Jupiter International Workshop
Frascati (Rome), Italy
April 21-22, 2008

http://www.ifsi.rm.cnr.it/index.php?categoryid=68

This is to announce a Workshop in association with studies for an 
international Europa/Jupiter System Mission in collaboration between
NASA, ESA, JAXA and possibly other international partners. 

This mission would carry out an in-depth study of Europa and the
Jupiter system, with special emphasis on studying Europa's 
habitability in the global context of the Jupiter system. This 
Workshop will provide a venue for the international science community
interested in the exploration of Europa and the Jupiter system to 
discuss the scientific and measurement objectives in the current plans
by the space agencies that are now engaged in studying this very
exciting and challenging mission to Europa and the Jupiter system. All
contributions from the community are welcome, to address in particular
the following three aspects of the mission design:

Science objectives,
Mission profile definition,
Design of necessary payload elements.

The Workshop is organised by INAF-IFSI and CESR with the support of ESA
and NASA.  Proposals for contributions can be sent to the members of 
the Organizing Committee.

Registration is required at the website above by April 3.

NATIONAL RESEARCH COUNCIL REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI): OPPORTUNITIES
ENABLED BY NASA'S CONSTELLATION SYSTEM 

The Space Studies Board and the Aeronautics and Space Engineering Board
of the National Research Council (NRC) have begun a study of science
opportunities enabled by NASA's Constellation system of launch vehicles
and spacecraft.

The Committee on Science Opportunities Enabled by NASA's Constellation
System will first analyze a set of "Vision Mission" concepts provided
by NASA. The results of this analysis will be included in an interim 
report to be completed by the end of April 2008. 

The mission concepts that the committee is analyzing for its interim 
report are listed on the committee's website:

http://www7.nationalacademies.org/ssb/constellation2008.html

In order to obtain the greatest possible input of ideas from the 
community about potential mission concepts addressing space science 
research, we are soliciting input from the broad community concerning 
ideas for missions or programs that are uniquely enabled by NASA's 
Constellation system.

[NASA] REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI): NEW SCIENCE INVESTIGATIONS USING
EXISTING NASA SPACECRAFT

Science Mission Directorate, NASA
Solicitation Number: NNH08ZDA005L
Release Date: March 14, 2008
Response Date: April 9, 2008

NASA's Science Mission Directorate (SMD) currently sponsors
approximately 85 flight missions, involving over 90 spacecraft,
divided between missions in development and missions in operations.
One of SMD's programmatic objectives is to maximize the science
return for the Nation within the available budget. This Request for
Information (RFI) solicits input from the broad space science
community that would contribute to NASA's study of possible new uses
for current NASA spacecraft beyond their current missions. Responses
to this RFI (NNH08ZDA005L) will be used to inform NASA's program 
planning. 

[Editor's Note: The complete RFI including background, requested 
information, and instructions for responding may be found at

[NASA] DRAFT STAND ALONE MISSIONS OF OPPORTUNITY NOTICE (SALMON) 
ANNOUNCEMENT OF OPPORTUNITY

NASA is releasing a DRAFT of the SALMON AO for community review and
comment. The five Program Element Appendices included in this DRAFT 
solicit: Lunar and Planetary Science Partner Missions of Opportunity, 
Lunar and Planetary Science U.S. Participating Investigators, Small 
Complete Missions of Opportunity in Astrobiology and Fundamental Space 
Biology, Earth Science U.S. Participating Investigators, and 
Astrophysics U.S.  Participating Investigators. Participation in this 
AO will be open to all categories of organizations (U.S. and non-U.S.), 
including educational institutions, industry, not-for-profit 
organizations, Federally Funded Research and Development Centers 
(FFRDCs), NASA Centers, the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), and other 
Government agencies.

NASA welcomes critical review and comment of this DRAFT, which will
be available from March 14, 2008, through April 4, 2008.

[NASA] TOWN HALL MEETING: HELIOPHYSICS MISSIONS 2009-2034

NASA's Heliophysics Division has begun the process of developing a 
Strategic Plan to chart the division's course over the coming decades.
A major input will be the strategic scientific research plan developed
by the newly formed Mission Planning Working Group (MiPWG). The focus
of the Division is to investigate the coupled Sun-Geospace system and
the impact of solar variability on planets and the space environment.

The Working Group solicits input from the scientific community to
develop this plan and invites you to participate in a Town Hall Meeting
to be held at the Holiday Inn College Park (I-95), 10000 Baltimore
Avenue, College Park, MD 20740 on May 19 and 20, 2008. The purpose of
this two-day forum is to give all those interested in Heliophysics
science the opportunity to provide direct input into the plan. The
meeting will continue the popular tradition of poster sessions for
presentation of ingenious strategies, creative tactics, and 
innovative mission concepts. Special focus will be placed on the
connected issues of launch vehicle availability and mission cost 
growth in a constrained budget environment.
