[NASA] NEW PROPOSAL OPPORTUNITY: ICESAT-II SCIENCE DEFINITION TEAM

This amendment establishes a new program element in Appendix A.26
entitled "ICESat-II Science Definition Team." This new program
element solicits proposals for team members and team leader for the
Science Definition Team (SDT) to engage in the science definition and
planning for the Ice Cloud and Land Elevation Satellite-II
(ICESat-II) mission. This science definition and planning period will
take place over the next three years. Members are expected to provide
expert guidance on the optimum measurement parameters for achieving
the required science objectives and on necessary tradeoffs.

Notices of Intent to propose are due May 30, 2008, and proposals are
due July 30, 2008.

On or about April 25, 2008, this Amendment to the NASA Research
Announcement "Research Opportunities in Space and Earth Sciences
(ROSES) 2008" (NNH08ZDA001N) will be posted on the NASA research
opportunity homepage at 

http://nspires.nasaprs.com/ (select "Solicitations" then "Open
Solicitations" then "NNH08ZDA001N").

Further information about the ICESat-II Science Definition Team
program element is available from Dr. Seelye Martin, Earth Science
Division, Science Mission Directorate, NASA Headquarters, Washington,
