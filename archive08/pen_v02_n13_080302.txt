[SPECIAL NASA MESSAGE] JAMES GREEN, PLANETARY SCIENCE DIVISION -
REVISED PRE-SCREENING OF NEW FRONTIERS PIS 
 
If you are planning to propose as a Principal Investigator for the 
upcoming New Frontiers (NF) AO please note that you will need to
satisfy a set of qualifications in order for your proposal to be
deemed compliant. A website has been set up that will enable you to 
be pre-screened.
 
It is important to note that Dr. Stern has recently approved a
modification to the previously issued qualifications that will produce
a wider pool of qualified PIs. If you had filled out the qualification
table prior to this announcement your information will be reviewed
against the new qualifications. Therefore you will not need to
resubmit your information. I would like to thank everyone who has
previously applied. Rest assured your efforts were not wasted.
 
Please read the new PI experience requirements document posted at:
 
http://newfrontiers.larc.nasa.gov/nf_prescreening.html
 
In the previous announcements on this subject it was stated that we
would be posting the NF cost cap by the end of February. The decisions
on the cost cap and other related information have not been made yet.
As soon as these decisions are made they will be announced. 

Any additional questions on the New Frontiers Program may be addressed
to Dr. Adriana C. Ocampo, NF Program Executive, Science Mission
Directorate, NASA, Washington, DC 20546; Tel.:
(202) 358-2152; Email: aco@nasa.gov. 

Questions on PI experience requirements may be addressed to Dr. Paul
Hertz, Senior Advisor, Science Mission Directorate, NASA, Washington,
DC 20546; Tel.: (202) 358-0986; Email: paul.hertz@nasa.gov.

[NASA] ADDITION OF NEW SCOPE TO ORIGINS OF SOLAR SYSTEMS

This amendment explicitly includes the search for extrasolar planets
that may harbor intelligent life within the scope of the Origins of 
Solar Systems program.

[NASA] REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ON SCIENTIST PARTICIPANT SUBORBITAL 
SCIENCE PILOT PROGRAM - FLIGHT RESEARCH

The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) recognizes the
advancement of the commercial suborbital spaceflight industry and
requests information on potential human-tended flight experiments
enabled by this capability. NASA's Science Mission Directorate (SMD) is
in the formulation phase of a possible new program to fly government-
sponsored payloads and researchers on commercial suborbital systems
with the intent of advancing SMD's goals and objectives.  

Responses to this RFI (NNH08ZDA004L) will be used to inform NASA's 
program planning.

OUTER PLANETS SESSION AT AGU WESTERN PACIFIC GEOPHYSICS MEETING,
CAIRNS, AUSTRALIA, 29 JULY-1 AUGUST. 

P02: Jupiter, Saturn and Their Satellites: New Perspectives Revealed by
the Cassini-Huygens and New Horizons Spacecraft Missions

The continued exploration of Saturn and Titan by the Cassini-Huygens 
mission and the flyby of Jupiter by the New Horizons spacecraft in 2007 
have revealed unprecedented views of the Jovian and Saturnian satellite 
systems. Analysis of these data, as well as data from previous 
spacecraft and Earth-based telescopic observations, continue to 
challenge our understanding of these systems. These data span 
significantly diverse worlds where phenomena range from geysers on 
Enceladus, rampant volcanism on Io, Ganymede's magnetic field and the 
Earth-like surface of Titan. Both NASA and ESA are currently studying 
future spacecraft missions to Jupiter and Saturn. 

This session will include invited and contributed presentations that 
discuss observations, data analysis and theoretical modeling of 
Jupiter, Saturn and their satellites, with emphasis on recent results
from the Cassini-Huygens and New Horizons missions. Contributions on
studies for future missions, as well as on the Uranus and Neptune
systems, are also welcome.

Abstract deadline: 16 April.

"THE GREAT PLANET DEBATE", SCIENCE CONFERENCE AND EDUCATOR WORKSHOP,
14-16 AUGUST 2008, JOHN HOPKINS UNIVERSITY, LAUREL MD

"The Great Planet Debate: Science as Process" is a scientific 
conference and educator workshop to be held August 14-16, 2008 at The 
Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory in Laurel, MD. Our
current understanding of planet formation, both inside and outside the
solar system, will be reviewed during the first two days. A workshop
will be held on the third day to discuss how educators can use the
"The Great Planet Debate" to teach science as a process.
