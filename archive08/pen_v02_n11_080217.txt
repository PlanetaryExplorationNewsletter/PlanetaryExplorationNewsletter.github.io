INPUT REQUESTED FOR SOFIA

As many of you may be aware the Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared
Astronomy (SOFIA) will soon be taking science data. In anticipation of
this event the SOFIA program is seeking ideas for early science from
the planetary community.  Observations would be done with the first
suite of instruments for SOFIA and would take place during the first
few years of operation.

Input is being coordinated through a science advisory team led by Dr. 
Bob Gehrz, and I have been asked to lead the collection of ideas from
the planetary science community. If you are unfamiliar with the SOFIA
instrumentation and the parameters and performance of the telescope, 
please go to the following web site: 

http://www.sofia.usra.edu/Science/instruments/sci_instruments.html.

You may send your ideas with a few paragraphs of explanation for why
this is an exciting and important observation to me at:

Black@lpi.usra.edu  

I will need your input by the end of February so that ideas can be
incorporated into a White Paper that will be presented and discussed 
at the summer AAS meeting.

MARS EXPRESS OMEGA-HRSC DATA WORKSHOP

A 3-day Mars Express OMEGA-HRSC Data Workshop will be held on 
Wednesday, Thursday, Friday (May 21-23, 2008) at PDS Geosciences Node,
Washington University, St. Louis in order to provide graduate students,
post-docs and other Mars investigators with a working knowledge of how
to use the Mars Express OMEGA (Observatoire pour la Mineraalogie,
l'Eau, les Glaces et l'Activite) and HRSC (High Resolution Stereo
Camera) data sets. 

This workshop will provide:

- Tutorials and hands-on with Mars Express data
- Explore data from ESA Planetary Science Archive
- Use data and tools with Instrument science teams

Workshop attendees are expected to supply their own computers equipped
with IDL. Workshop attendance will be limited to 30.  If interested in 
participating, contact:

Tommy Thompson (JPL, twhompson@jpl.nasa.gov, 818-354-3881).

A block of rooms at near-by Crowne-Plaza-Clayton Hotel will be 
available for booking until April 19.

ANNUAL MEETING OF PLANETARY GEOLOGIC MAPPERS, JUNE 19-20, 2008

I would like to announce that "The Annual Meeting of Planetary
Geologic Mappers" will be held June 19th and 20th, 2008 at the US
Geologic Survey in Flagstaff, AZ.  A URL will be made available at a
later date.
