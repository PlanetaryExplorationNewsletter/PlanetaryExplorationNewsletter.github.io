SOLAR-EXTRASOLAR PLANET FORMATION MEETING AT AMES

Dear colleagues,

This is the first announcement of a solar-extrasolar planet formation
meeting to take place at NASA Ames on the 5-6 (and possibly 7
depending on the level of interest) of February 2009.
interest) of February 2009.

Reconciling observations of extrasolar planets with those of the solar
system will engage the efforts of planetary formation observers and
theorists for the forseeable future. The aim of this meeting is to
promote cross-fertilization between the extrasolar and the solar
planetary communities. The topics will include both theoretical and 
observational characterization of protostars and planets. The 
emphasis of the meeting will be to compare and contrast planetary
systems. Ideally, constraints derived from diverse planetary systems
will be complementary; yet, the extent to which such systems can be
viewed under a common prism remains to be clarified. Talks seeking
to shed light on this issue will be particularly encouraged.

If you would like to attend this meeting please contact me at
mosqueir@cosmic.arc.nasa.gov

We look forward to an exciting and productive meeting.

Sincerely,
Ignacio Mosqueira

Contributions can discuss any aspect of cosmic dust including cometary
dust, asteroidal dust, interplanetary dust, circumplanetary dust, 
presolar grains, IDPs, micrometeorites, meteoroids, meteors, and 
regolith particles.
