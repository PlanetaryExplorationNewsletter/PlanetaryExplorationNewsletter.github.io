COSMIC CATACLYSMS AND LIFE

10 - 14 November 2008
ESRIN, Frascati, Italy

Abstract submission deadline: 17 July 2008

Conference website:

http://www.congrex.nl/08c16/

A number of cataclysms have occurred in the history of the universe 
and the Solar System. The Symposium will review those that had a 
critical influence on the evolution of habitable worlds and on the 
emergence and survival of life on Earth, and possibly elsewhere.

IAG PLANETARY GEOMORPHOLOGY IMAGE OF THE MONTH

The July 'Image of the month' is now available at the IAG's Planetary
Geomorphology web page:  

http://www.psi.edu/pgwg/images/jul08image.html

This month's topic is on haematite concretions on Mars and dedos in
loosely consolidated sediment in Australia.

The images and information are a free educational resource provided 
to encourage the inclusion of planetary geomorphology topics in 
curriculum. They are also intended to stimulate collaboration
between geomorphologists studying Earth landforms and those who 
focus primarily on other planetary surfaces.

If you would like to contribute an image (Earth analogs are 
welcome) please contact mbourke@psi.edu

Past images and captions are available at:

ASTRONOMICAL JOURNAL SEEKS AN ASSOCIATE SCIENTIFIC EDITOR

In response to community interest, The Astronomical Journal plans to 
add an Associate Editor with expertise in planetary science to its 
editorial team. We intend to make this appointment in the late summer 
of 2008 for a 2 year period, after which we will re-advertise the 
position with the newly developed details for a 3-year term. As this 
is a new position duties will include helping us develop the role of 
an Associate Editor in the operations and planning processes of the 
AJ, as well as handling the review of planetary science papers. The 
AJ Associate Editor will report to the Editor-in-Chief, should attend 
one annual AJ meeting and plan to spend 2-3 hours/week on editorial 
duties. We will provide modest compensation above expenses for this 
service.

Expressions of interest or nominations should be emailed to Jay
Gallagher, AJ Editor-in-Chief (aj@astro.wisc.edu) by the close
of business on August 20, 2008.  Candidates for this position
will be discussed by Gallagher; Margaret Hanson, AJ Associate
Editor-in-Chief, Mike A'Hearn, recent chair of the AAS Publications
Board; and Chris Biemesderfer, AAS Publications Manager. A selection
will be made by Gallagher in early September 2008.

POST-DOCTORAL RESEARCH POSITION IN THE NETHERLANDS

Position title:
Post-doctoral research position in the area of instrument development 
for direct detection of extra-solar planets
 
Institution:
NWO - ASTRON in the Netherlands
 
Brief description of the job:
The position is available within the project SPHERE, the 2e 
generation VLT instrument aimed at the direct detection of extra-solar
planets.

The Netherlands (ASTRON, Universities of Amsterdam and Utrecht and 
NOVA) and Switzerland (ETH Zurich) lead the development and 
construction of the SPHERE-ZIMPOL subsystem, a high-precision imaging 
polarimeter. ZIMPOL is optimized to study the formation, evolution 
and structure of extra-solar planetary systems. The available 
position will primarily be in the areas of the integration, testing 
and calibration of the instrument. The researcher will also have the 
opportunity to contribute to the data analysis, interpretation and 
modeling including first light observations and commissioning. Fifty
percent of the time is free for research.

The position is available starting from October 15, 2008 as a 
full-time temporary appointment for two years, with the possible 
extension of a third year.

ASSISTANT RESEARCH PHYSICIST POSITION AT UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, 
BERKELEY

The Space Sciences Laboratory at the University of California, 
Berkeley,  is seeking to fill a position at the level of Assistant 
Research Physicist, specifically in the area of Mars space physics 
and geophysics, with equal emphasis on data analysis, modeling and 
instrument development.  

Topics of interest are the Mars-solar wind interaction, the patchy 
night-side ionosphere, the effects of solar energetic particle events 
and solar storms on the atmosphere, atmospheric loss and resulting 
climate evolution, and the dynamic thermosphere and the effects of 
dust storms thereon.

Applicants must have a Ph.D. in Physics, Astronomy, or Planetary 
Science and at least two years of postdoctoral experience in some
of these areas, with a proven track record of publication in the
Mars community. Strong analytical and programming skills are
required for both data analysis and modeling.  Familiarity with 
IDL and hardware experience would be preferable.

Interested applicants should send a curriculum vitae, list of 
publications, statement of research interests, and contact details 
for at least three references to Ms. Daniele Meilhan, Space 
Sciences Laboratory, 7 Gauss Way, University of California,
Berkeley, CA 94720.

Applications must be received by 9/1/08.  AAE/EOE.

POSTDOCTORAL POSITION AT JPL

The California Institute of Technology Postdoctoral Scholars Program 
at JPL invites applications for postdoctoral research positions in 
Martian atmospheric properties and dynamics. The research will involve
analysis and modeling of data collected by the Mars Climate Sounder 
(MCS) instrument on board the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO) 
spacecraft.  MCS is an advanced limb-sounding infrared radiometer 
that collects data in one visible and 8 infrared channels, to 
characterize Mars atmospheric temperature and composition with 
unprecedented vertical resolution.  MCS has been collecting data at 
Mars since 24 September 2006.  The successful candidate will work 
with retrieved profiles of temperature, pressure, and ice and 
aerosols abundance to study the distribution and properties of 
Martian clouds and dust and Martian atmospheric dynamics. 
 
A Ph.D. in planetary atmospheric sciences or related fields is 
required.  Experience in the analysis of Martian atmospheric data 
and processes is highly desirable.  

The positions are open immediately.  Applicants should submit a CV 
and the names of three references to:
 
Dr. David M. Kass
Jet Propulsion Laboratory,  M/S 169-237
4800 Oak Grove Dr.
Pasadena, CA 91109
