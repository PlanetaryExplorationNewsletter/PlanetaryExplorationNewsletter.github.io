WOMEN IN PLANETARY SCIENCE

The women behind WomeninPlanetaryScience.org invite you to visit our
blog, leave a comment, and join us in writing and talking about the
issues that women may disproportionately face as they work in the field
of planetary science.  Major topics will include the recruitment and
retention of women in planetary science, the two-body problem, the
addition of babies and kids, work-life balance, flight mission
experience, grant flexibility, laboratory environments, and any
relevant studies that have appeared in the major journals or around
the web.  We will also post interesting tidbits of experience that may
help readers improve grant proposals or research life, and
occasionally feature women in planetary science who have just
announced important discoveries.  

We welcome your participation and comments at 

http://womeninplanetaryscience.org 

or the associated email list, which may be joined by sending a message
to:

REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI): PAYLOAD FLIGHT OPPORTUNITY FOR ODYSSEY
MOON LIMITED M-1 LUNAR LANDER MISSION

Release Date: March 11, 2008
Response Date: April 12, 2008

On March 11th, 2008, at the 39th Lunar and Planetary Science
Conference, Odyssey Moon Limited released a Request for Information
(RFI) for a Payload Flight Opportunity aboard its inaugural M-1 lunar
lander mission.
 
Odyssey Moon is conducting this request for information (RFI) to
survey interest in the international lunar community for this payload
flight opportunity. Odyssey Moon seeks to identify potential payloads
and Principal Investigators (PIs) who wish to explore rapid, low-cost
lunar flight opportunities and will work with PI's to identify how
such flight opportunities could be supported by national space agencies
and other sources.
 
Responses are requested by April 12th, 2008. 
 
The RFI can be downloaded at:

NASA'S 20TH ANNUAL PLANETARY SCIENCE SUMMER SCHOOL

Location: JPL, Pasadena CA
Dates: July 21-25 and August 4-8
Applications due: May 1, 2008

http://pscischool.jpl.nasa.gov

Science and engineering recent PhDs, post-doctoral and doctoral
students with a strong interest in careers in planetary exploration
are encouraged to apply.  Applicants must be U.S. citizens or
resident aliens ("green card" holders) and must be living within the
U.S. at the time of application.

The student teams will develop the equivalent of an early concept
study responsive to a typical NASA Announcement of Opportunity for
robotic missions, prepare a presentation for a proposal authorization
review, present it to a review board, and receive feedback.  At the
end of the week, students will have a clearer understanding of the
relationships among mission design, cost, and schedule, and the
trade-offs necessary to stay within cost and schedule while preserving 
the opportunity to acquire high-quality science.  They will also 
understand the lifecycle of a robotic space mission.

Partial financial support is available to a limited number of
individuals to help defray the expense of travel and lodging only.

COSMIC CATACLYSMS AND LIFE, ESRIN (FRASCATI, ITALY), 10-14 NOVEMBER 

Abstract Deadline: 17 June 2008

A number of cataclysms have occurred in the history of the universe and
the Solar System. The Symposium will review those that had a critical
influence on the evolution of habitable worlds and on the emergence and
survival of life on Earth, and possibly elsewhere.  The sessions will
discuss the following topics: 

- Big Bang and the formation of light elements, element nucleosynthesis
  in stars and Supernovae 
- Violent processes in star formation, interstellar/circumstellar 
  shocks and the synthesis of molecules 
- Collisions and planetary formation 
- Formation of the Moon and its influence on Earth 
- Late heavy bombardment and the emergence of life 
- The role of impacts in inhibiting, transporting or threatening life 
- Hazards from stellar flares and space weather 
- Hazards from black holes and gamma ray bursts 
- Cosmic habitability, prevalence of Earth-like planets, the fate of 
  the Earth 
- Historical, outreach and education aspects of cataclysms (e.g.
  Tunguska 1908)
