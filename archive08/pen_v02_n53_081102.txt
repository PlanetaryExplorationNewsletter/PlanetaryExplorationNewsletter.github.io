NAMING PLANETARY FEATURES

Naming planetary features is serious business!  This important task 
is managed by the International Astronomical Union (IAU), Working 
Group for Planetary System Nomenclature (WPGSN):

http://planetarynames.wr.usgs.gov/ 

Names adopted by the IAU must follow rules and conventions 
established by the IAU, see summary at 

http://planetarynames.wr.usgs.gov/rules.html

Scientists needing formal names for their planetary research are 
required to submit an official request via the Name Request Form:

http://planetarynames.wr.usgs.gov/jsp/request.jsp  

Allow at least 6 to 8 weeks for the review and approval process, but
more time may be necessary if the proposal is complicated or if  or 
if questions are raised during the review process.  Upon successful 
review by members of the WGPSN, names are considered approved and 
can be used on maps and in publications.

Questions about the process should be sent to the president of the 
WGPSN:

http://planetarynames.wr.usgs.gov/append1.html 

or to USGS Astrogeology Research Program, attention Jennifer Blue,
2255 N. Gemini Drive, Flagstaff, Arizona 86001, or by e-mail at
jblue@usgs.gov.

ANNOUNCEMENT: SATURN, ITS MAGNETOSPHERE, AND TITAN AFTER 
CASSINI-HUYGENS SPECIAL ISSUE OF PLANETARY AND SPACE SCIENCE

In response to the recent Titan after Cassini-Huygens symposium in
Corpus Christi, TX:

http://titanaftercassini.com 

and the Saturn after Cassini-Huygens symposium in London, Great
Britain:

http://saturnaftercassini.org 

the conveners have arranged for a special issue of Planetary and 
Space Science devoted to papers regarding Titan, Saturn, and Saturn's
Magnetosphere as we know them following the Cassini-Huygens prime
mission.  Rings and icy satellites papers should be directed to a 
separate special issue (contact Larry Esposito 
larry.esposito@lasp.colorado.edu and/or Amanda Hendrix
amanda.hendrix@jpl.nasa.gov regarding this other special issue).
 
Papers may be theoretical, observational, or computational in 
nature and need not necessarily utilize Cassini-Huygens data.  
The due date is 2008 November 15.

Papers should be submitted via the online P&SS submission system 
located at:

into the special issue, please select as
