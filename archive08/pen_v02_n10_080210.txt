DR. GORDON MCKAY (1945-2008)

Dear Colleagues,

It is with deep sadness that we write on behalf of the Science Mission 
Directorate to mourn the untimely passing and celebrate the life and 
career of Dr. Gordon McKay. Beginning his career as a Ph.D. student 
on the first lunar samples returned to Earth by the Apollo astronauts 
and ending it in a role of exceptional leadership at a NASA review 
panel, Gordon devoted his life to public service and the advancement 
of scientific knowledge. Gordon was someone who epitomized being a 
civil servant.

Gordon's decades of research yielded numerous major contributions and 
international recognition in Lunar and Martian petrology and 
geochemistry, most notably in the area of petrogenesis - how the lunar 
rocks were formed. He began his formal association with NASA in 1977 
as a two-year post-doc. He spent a year at HQ as a management fellow 
before permanently joining the NASA family at the Johnson Space Center.
Over his career, Gordon served on and led innumerable review panels, 
study teams, and working groups. In recent years, he also developed 
close working relationships with Japanese researchers, spending 7 
months at the University of Tokyo working on Martian meteoritics, 
another area of his expertise. Most recently, Gordon was assisting 
NASA with its future lunar and Mars exploration plans.

In addition to his scientific contributions, Gordon was a respected 
and well-loved manager for nearly two decades in the Astromaterials 
Research and Exploration Science Division at JSC, fondly but firmly 
"herding cats" (as he often described it) to help NASA achieve its 
goals.  Gordon also had a passionate commitment to educating and 
inspiring young scientists, mentoring dozens of interns and students 
over the years.

Gordon is survived by his wife and long-time JSC civil servant, Linda 
Uljon, and their two college-age daughters. His brother, David McKay, 
and his sister in law Mary Fae are also JSC colleagues. Gordon made 
immeasurable impacts on planetary science. We extend our warmest 
appreciation and deepest sympathies to Gordon's family and friends for 
a life well led and a man we and the NASA family will miss.

Alan Stern and Jim Green

[EDITORIAL] THE FUTURE OF OUR MARS EXPLORATION PROGRAM - ROBERT D.
BRAUN, GEORGIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY

This week, in stark contrast to the successful performance of the Mars
exploration program, NASA announced a significant reduction in its
FY09 budget request for Mars exploration. By removing any semblance of
a continuous exploration sequence, this week's budget announcement may
signal the beginning of the end of what has been a dramatic
advancement in our understanding of the Mars system. Clearly, this
topic requires your careful consideration and will be part of the
discussion at the upcoming MEPAG meeting (February 20-21 in Monrovia,
CA). Among the discussion at this meeting, will be a presentation on
the future of the Mars program, given by SMD AA Dr. Alan Stern. Listen
carefully to what he has to say. Think critically about the
feasibility of this plan. Then, decide for yourself. We are at a
critical juncture in planning this program. Now is the time for your
voice to be heard.

[NASA] PROGRAM SCIENTIST CHANGE AT HQ

Dr. Michael S. Kelley, formerly of the Department of Geology & 
Geography at Georgia Southern University, has joined the Planetary 
Science Division at NASA Headquarters.  In addition to more than 
twenty years of geological research, teaching, and field experience,
Mike brings to the Division private sector corporate experience and
many years of service to the planetary science community.   He is a
long-time Visiting Astronomer at the NASA Infrared Telescope Facility,
and served as chair of the Planetary Geology Division of the 
Geological Society of America and its award committees.  He 
participated in the Antarctic Search for Meteorites Program, and 
conducted postdoctoral research at NASA Johnson Space Center.  Along
with other assignments, Mike will be assuming duties as Program
Scientist for the Planetary Geology and Geophysics Program and the
Planetary Data System.  He will also serve as Program Scientist for 
the EPOXI and Stardust-NExT Discovery Spacecraft Missions. Mike looks
forward to serving the planetary science community in this new
capacity.

PREPARING FOR THE INTERNATIONAL YEAR OF ASTRONOMY (2009)

The 2008 Meeting of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific
St. Louis, MO: May 31 - June 4, 2008
 
Held in conjunction with the summer meeting of the American 
Astronomical Society, this meeting will consist of hands-on workshops 
(over the weekend) and then a three-day symposium to help educators, 
scientists, public information professionals, and everyone working in 
astronomy and space-science outreach to prepare for the year-long 
celebration of 400 years of the telescope (since Galileo first turned 
his instrument to the skies).
 
Endorsed by the United Nations, UNESCO and the International 
Astronomical Union, the 2009 International Year of Astronomy (IYA) 
aims to stimulate worldwide interest in science through engagement in 
astronomy activities -- with the central theme of "The Universe: 
Yours to Discover."  The U.S. effort has the aim to provide "an 
engaging astronomy experience to every person in the country, to 
nurture existing partnerships, and to build new connections to sustain 
public interest in astronomy."
