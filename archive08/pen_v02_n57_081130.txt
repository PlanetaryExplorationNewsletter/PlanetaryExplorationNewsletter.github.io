[NASA] DELAY OF DUE DATE FOR SMALL COMPLETE MISSIONS IN ASTROBIOLOGY 
AND FUNDAMENTAL SPACE BIOLOGY

With this amendment, the NASA Announcement of Opportunity
NNH08ZDA009O, "Stand Alone Missions of Opportunity Notice (SALMON),"
is amended to delay the proposal due date for proposals submitted in
response to Program Element Appendix H3: Small Complete Missions of
Opportunity in Astrobiology and Fundamental Space Biology.

The proposal due date for Small Complete Missions of Opportunity in
Astrobiology and Fundamental Space Biology proposals is delayed until
early in 2009.

On or about November 24, 2008, Amendment No. 2 to the NASA
Announcement of Opportunity "Stand Alone Missions of Opportunity
Notice (SALMON)" (NNH08ZDA009O) will be posted on the NASA research
opportunity homepage at http://nspires.nasaprs.com/ (select
"Solicitations" then "Open Solicitations" then "NNH08ZDA009O").

Technical or scientific questions concerning Small Complete Missions
in Astrobiology may be addressed to Dr. Catharine A. Conley, 
E-mail: Cassie.Conley@nasa.gov.

Technical or scientific questions concerning Small Complete Missions
in Fundamental Space Biology may be addressed to Dr. Jacob Cohen,

[NASA PDS] NEW MAIN WEB SITE NOW AVAILABLE

The Planetary Data System main web site has undergone a revision 
designed to make data and tools easier for researchers to find. Please 
visit the site at:

http://pds.nasa.gov/

If you have any suggestions for further improvement and/or encounter 
any problems, please send feedback to pds_operator@jpl.nasa.gov, or
use the feedback link on the site.

HUMAN-TENDED SUBORBITAL SCIENCE WORKSHOP

The Personal Spaceflight Federation and NASA Ames Research Center
cordially invite you to join Ames Center Director Pete Worden in
attending the Human-Tended Suborbital Science Workshop, to take place
at the Westin San Francisco Market Street on Monday, December 15, 2008
from 12:00 pm to 5:00 pm.   The workshop is being held in conjunction
with the American Geophysical Union Fall Meeting and is sponsored by
the Universities Space Research Association.

Recently, in an historic first, NASA created a program office at NASA
Ames for the use of emerging commercial suborbital vehicles for
scientific research, including, but not limited to, flights to space
of researchers to allow for human-tended experiments.   The purpose of
the workshop is to bring interested researchers together with
suborbital vehicle operators to discuss the scientific potential of
these exciting new capabilities.   Companies that will be
participating in the workshop include Virgin Galactic, Armadillo
Aerospace, Blue Origin, Masten Space Systems, and XCOR Aerospace.
Researchers from the fields of heliophysics, planetary sciences, earth
sciences, and microgravity sciences are expected to attend.

To assist with our preparations, please RSVP by contacting Lisa
Chu-Thielbar before December 5, 2008 at lisa.chu-thielbar@nasa.gov.
We look forward to seeing you at the event.

WORKSHOP ON VENUS GEOCHEMISTRY: PROGRESS, PROSPECTS, AND NEW MISSIONS

February 26-27, 2009

Gilruth Center at NASA Johnson Space Center, Houston, Texas

http://www.lpi.usra.edu/meetings/venus2009/

Due to the current NASA travel restrictions, the dates and venue for  
the Venus Geochemistry workshop have been changed.

The workshop will be held at the Gilruth Center at NASA Johnson Space  
Center (the Gilruth Center is located outside the security gates) on  
February 26-27.

The VEXAG meeting will still be held at the Lunar and Planetary  
Institute on February 25.

The abstract deadline has also been extended slightly. The new  
deadline for abstract submission is Thursday, December 4, 5:00 p.m. 
CST.
