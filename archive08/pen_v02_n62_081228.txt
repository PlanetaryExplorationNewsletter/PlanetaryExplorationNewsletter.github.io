NEW PLANETARY PHD PROGRAM AND WEB SITE LAUNCH AT UCF IN ORLANDO

The Planetary Sciences Group in the Department of Physics at the
University of Central Florida is pleased to announce a new PhD Track
in Planetary Sciences, effective Spring 2009.  The program balances
early participation in research with a broad academic program.
Applications received by 15 January 2009 will receive full
consideration for Fall 2009 financial support.  Learn more about the
program and UCF's growing center for planetary research at our new web
site:

http://planets.ucf.edu/

UCF planetary research includes comet and asteroid observation,
meteorite analysis, direct measurement of exoplanets, atmospheric
modeling, computational modeling of atmospheric impacts, solid impacts
studied in microgravity, laboratory astrophysics, and studies of
Saturn's rings and dust dynamics.
