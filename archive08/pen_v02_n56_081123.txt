[NASA] REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI): INSTRUMENTS FOR THE INTERNATIONAL
LUNAR NETWORK (ILN)

Release Date: November 17, 2008 
Response Date: December 19, 2008

NASA is seeking information regarding potential instruments to be 
flown on the U.S. nodes that will be a part of the International Lunar
Network (ILN).

NASA is soliciting information through this Request for Information
(RFI) on the following types of instruments being considered for the 
ILN: seismometers, heat flow probes, electromagnetic probes, and laser
ranging instrumentation. However, as the Core Instruments Working Group
CIWG) of the international ILN is still  identifying a core instrument
set, other available lightweight instrument types that could both 
provide complimentary data and make use of the unique capabilities of a
lunar network will also be considered; information on such instruments
is also solicited by this RFI. 

The complete RFI may be found at:

http://nspires.nasaprs.com/
(select "Solicitations" then "Open Solicitations" then "Request for 
Information (NNH09ZDA005L): Instruments for U.S. ILN Lunar Missions").

Questions should be addressed to

Directorate, National Aeronautics and Space Administration,

[NASA] NEW ROSES DUE DATE FOR ASTROBIOLOGY SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY 
INSTRUMENT DEVELOPMENT (ASTID)

This amendment changes the proposal due date for Appendix C.19, 
Astrobiology Science and Technology Instrument Development, including 
Concept Studies for Astrobiology Small Payloads and Satellites 
(ASTID). The proposal due date was inadvertently set for a Saturday.

The proposal due date for ASTID is being changed to December 19, 2008.

On or about November 21, 2008, this Amendment to the NASA Research 
Announcement "Research Opportunities in Space and Earth Sciences 
(ROSES) 2008" (NNH08ZDA001N) will be posted on the NASA research 
opportunity homepage at:

http://nspires.nasaprs.com/ 
(select "Solicitations" then "Open Solicitations" then "NNH08ZDA001N").

Questions concerning ASTID may be addressed to Dr. Michael New, 
Planetary Science Division, Science Mission Directorate, NASA 
Headquarters, Washington, DC 20546-0001;

JOB OPPORTUNITY: KUIPER BELT STUDIES AT NORTHERN ARIZON UNIVERSITY

The Department of Physics and Astronomy at Northern Arizona University
(NAU) seeks an outstanding postdoctoral scholar to work with Professor
David Trilling in studies of the Kuiper Belt. The successful candidate
will use both archival datasets and acquire new observations of the
Kuiper Belt, and may also execute independent research. NAU has full
competitive access to all University of Arizona Observatories
facilities, including the 6.5-meter MMT and Magellan telescopes, the
2x8.4-meter Large Binocular Telescope, and numerous smaller
telescopes. Ample research and travel funds will be available.

For a complete description, see

http://members.aas.org/JobReg/JobDetailPage.cfm?JobID=25208

Consideration of applications will begin on January 15, 2009.

SUPPLEMENTAL CALL FOR PROPOSALS FOR HST CYCLE 16 OBSERVATIONS

NASA and The Space Telescope Science Institute (STScI) announce a 
Supplemental Call for Observing Proposals for the Hubble Space 
Telescope (HST). Participation in this program is open to all 
categories of organizations, both domestic and foreign, including 
educational institutions, profit and nonprofit organizations, NASA 
Centers, and other Government agencies.

This solicitation for proposals will be open through Monday December 
8, 2008 11:59pm EST. The Astronomer's Proposal Tools (APT) version 
17.2.6, which is required for Phase I Proposal Submission, will be 
released on Monday November 17, 2008 and can be downloaded from:

http://www.stsci.edu/hst/proposing/apt.

Submitted proposals will be reviewed by members of the Cycle 16 & 17
Time Allocation Committees. Results of the selection will be 
announced no later than January 13, 2009.

We anticipate allocating 1,000 to 1,200 orbits for an SM4 launch in 
the April/May timeframe. If SM4 is scheduled at a later date, the 
allocation will be increased accordingly.
