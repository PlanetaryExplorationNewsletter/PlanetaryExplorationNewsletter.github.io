[NASA] PDS RELEASES ROSETTA IES (RPC) DATA

The NASA Planetary Data System is pleased to announce the delivery of 
data from the Ion and Electron Sensor of ROSETTA Orbiter Plasma 
Consortium. The delivery includes raw and calibrated data from the 
COMMISSIONING, CHECKOUT, EARTH SWING-BY, and MARS SWING-BY phases of 
the Rosetta mission. 

To see and download the data as well as mission and instrument
information, go to:

ESA POSTDOCTORAL FELLOWSHIPS IN SPACE SCIENCE - DEADLINE 1ST OCTOBER 
2008

The European Space Agency awards several postdoctoral fellowships each
year. The aim of these fellowships is to provide young scientists, 
holding a PhD or the equivalent degree, with the means of performing
space science research in fields related to the ESA Science Programme.
Areas of research include planetary science, astronomy and 
astrophysics, solar and solar-terrestrial science, plasma physics and
fundamental physics. The fellowships are tenable at the European Space
Research and Technology Centre (ESTEC) in Noordwijk, Netherlands, or
at the European Space Astronomy Centre (ESAC) in Villafranca del 
Castillo, near Madrid, Spain.

Applications are solicited for fellowships in space science to begin
in summer or fall 2009. Preference will be given to applications
submitted by candidates within five years of receiving their PhD.
Candidates not holding a PhD yet are encouraged to apply, but they 
must provide evidence of receiving their degree before starting the 
fellowship.

The deadline for applications is 1 October 2008.

More information on the ESA Research Fellowship programme in Space
Science, on the conditions and eligibility, as well as the application
form can be found at:

MEPAG INVITATION

You are invited to attend the next meeting of the Mars Exploration 
Program Analysis Group (MEPAG), on September 18, 2008 at the 
DoubleTree Hotel, Monrovia, CA.  This follows the 3rd MSL Landing Site
Workshop, which runs September 15-17 in the same venue.

This meeting comes after a spring and summer of exciting science and
exploration on Mars.  In addition, our hard work at the last meeting
has already benefited the Mars Program.

Key agenda topics will include:
o Results and Implications of the Phoenix mission.
o Discussion of Mars program status and future planning, including
  potential international collaborations.
o Outbriefs from recent Mars Architecture Tiger Team (MATT) and 
  IMARS activities.  This will include discussions of options for 
  the 2016-2018 opportunities and Mars Sample Return options.
  White papers from many of these groups will be published at
   
  http://mepag.jpl.nasa.gov/reports/index.html 
   
  before the meeting.  
  Please read these papers before the meeting so you can
  fully participate in the discussions.
o Planning for additional MEPAG work.

The meeting is open to all members of the Mars science community, 
including international colleagues, and broadcast via WebEx for those
who cannot attend in person.  I hope you can attend.

Sincerely,
Dr. Jack Mustard
MEPAG Chair

FALL AGU SESSION: NEW DEVELOPMENTS IN THE STUDY OF FLUVIAL SYSTEMS ON 
MARS

2008 Fall AGU Meeting, San Francisco, December 15-19
Abstract submission deadline: September 10th, 2008 

P11: New Developments in the Study of Fluvial Systems on Mars
Sponsor: Planetary Sciences
Cosponsor: Hydrology
Conveners:  Alexandra Davatzes (Temple University), Virginia Gulick 
(NASA Ames/SETI)

The successes of recent Mars missions provide opportunities for 
integrating multiple data sets to shed new light on fluvial and 
hydrothermal processes on Mars. Current and recent missions, including
MRO, Mars Odyssey, Mars Express, and MGS have produced a range of
imaging, spectral, and other data sets that together can place
powerful constraints on the surface and subsurface conditions and
processes that led to surface and groundwater flow and the eventual
formation of fluvial features on the surface of Mars. Integrating
these various data sets (e.g., high-resolution imaging and 
spectroscopy with measures of subsurface water abundance) is essential
for testing existing hypotheses and developing new insights on the
formation of fluvial and hydrothermal surface features including
outflows from fractures and possible spring mounds. We invite
abstracts reporting such studies including work on understanding
the formation of gullies, outflow channels, large valley systems and
valley networks on Mars.

ASSISTANT RESEARCH PHYSICIST: MARS SPACE PHYSICS AND GEOPHYSICS 

The Space Sciences Laboratory at the University of California, 
Berkeley, seeks to fill an Assistant Research Physicist position in the
area of Mars space physics and geophysics.  Topics of interest are the
Mars-solar wind interaction, the night-side ionosphere, the effects of
solar energetic particle events and solar storms on the atmosphere,
atmospheric loss and resulting climate evolution, the dynamic 
thermosphere and the effects of dust storms thereon, magnetic effects
of large meteorite impacts, volcanic, magmatic and tectonic evolution
studies through observations of thermal demagnetization and the
history of the now-extinct Martian global magnetic field. 

Applicants must have a Ph.D. related to space or Planetary physics and
at least two years of postdoctoral experience in some of these areas,
with a track record of publication in the Mars community. Analytical
and programming skills are required for both data analysis and 
modeling. Familiarity with IDL and hardware experience is preferable. 

Interested applicants should send a curriculum vitae, list of 
publications, statement of research interests, and contact details for
at least three references to 

Daniele Meilhan
Space Sciences Laboratory
7 Gauss Way
University of California
Berkeley
CA 94720

Applications must be received by 9/1/08.

OUTER PLANETS COLLOQUIUM SERIES

Would your institution like a visit and colloquium presentation this 
Fall from an expert in outer solar system science, at no expense to 
you?  Would you like travel support to share your outer solar system 
research?  Presenters and host institutions are sought for the Outer 
Planets Colloquium Series, a program that matches planetary scientists
with university campuses and research institutions.  

Participation is open to two- and four-year undergraduate colleges,
and to research institutions throughout the United States. Host 
institutions commit to making the necessary local arrangements. 
Presenters are encouraged to address the needs of the next generation
of scientists (graduate students, interns, and undergraduates) and to
give an additional presentation that is free and open to the general
public. Other interactions that increase awareness of outer solar 
system science may also be considered as part of the visit. These may
include guest teaching a class, interacting informally with students
and faculty, visiting local precollege campuses, or other outreach
activities.

A range of topics is anticipated on the basis of speaker participation.

The Colloquium Series will cover the presenter's travel expenses.
There will be no honorarium for the speaker.
