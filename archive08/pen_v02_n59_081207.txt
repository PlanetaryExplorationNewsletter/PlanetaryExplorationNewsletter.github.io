VENUS SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY DEFINITION TEAM OPEN HOUSE MEETING AT 
FALL AGU

The Venus Science and Technology Definition Team is nearing 
completion of its final report, to be delivered to NASA in late 
January 2009.  The report will detail the science objectives, 
mission architecture, payload, and costs of a flagship mission to 
Venus.  There will be a meeting at the Fall AGU meeting in San 
Francisco, open to all interested members of the community. 

The meeting will be held on Wednesday, December 17 from 12:30 to 1:30

JOB OPPORTUNITIES: TWO ASSISTANT OR ASSOCIATE PROFESSORS IN SOLID 
EARTH GEOPHYSICS AND PLANETARY SCIENCES, HARVARD UNIVERSITY


Institution: Harvard University, Department of Earth & Planetary 
Sciences 

Position Title: Assistant or Associate Professor in Solid Earth
Geophysics and Planetary Sciences 

The Department of Earth & Planetary Sciences at Harvard University 
invites applications for two tenure-track faculty positions at the 
assistant or associate professor level (untenured) in the fields of
solid Earth geophysics and planetary sciences. 

We seek exceptional scientists and educators who work with 
theoretical, laboratory or observational approaches, and have a broad
view of Earth and planetary systems. We anticipate hiring one 
candidate in each of the subject areas, but also encourage applicants
who contribute to both disciplines. 

Candidates should submit an application form and supporting material
electronically. The supporting material should include a statement of
research and teaching interests, curriculum vitae, and the names and 
contact information (including email addresses) of three references. 

To apply, visit: 

http://www.eps.harvard.edu/jobs.php. 

Review of applications will begin on January 5, 2009. We particularly
encourage applications from or nominations of women and minorities.

LUNAR GEOCHEMISTRY AND CHRONOLOGY: A SAMPLE AND REMOTE SENSING DATA 
PERSPECTIVE AT GOLDSCHMIDT CONFERENCE 2009, DAVOS, SWITZERLAND
 
Dear Community,
 
As co-conveners of the " Lunar Geochemistry and Chronology: A Sample 
and Remote Sensing Data Perspective" Session at the upcoming 
Goldschmidt conference 2009, Davos, Switzerland, from June 21st-26th, 
we would like to invite you to participate in this session and submit 
an abstract by February 22nd, 2009 (23:59 UTC). Accepted abstracts
 will be published in Geochimica et Cosmochmica Acta.
 
The focus of the session is:
 
Lunar geochemistry and chronology have been revitalized in recent 
years by global data obtained from orbit: Clementine, Lunar 
Prospector, SMART-1, Kaguya, Chang'e-1, Chandrayaan-1 and soon LRO; 
samples that represent previously unsampled/uninvestigated 
compositional domains (e.g. meteorites); and new and improved 
analytical techniques allowing analyses of the smaller Apollo and 
Luna Samples. The aim of this session is to further explore synergies
between different data sets for the evolving understanding of the
formation and early differentiation of the Moon, lunar mantle and 
crust evolution, and lunar (and Earth) impact history.
