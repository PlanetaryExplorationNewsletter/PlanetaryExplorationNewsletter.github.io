ICARUS: NEW MANUSCRIPT SUBMISSION PROCEDURE

As of 1 August 2008, new manuscript submissions to Icarus are being
processed through the online Elsevier Editorial System.
Authors wishing to submit new manuscripts will now need to do so
through the Icarus web page on the Elsevier Editorial System at

http://ees.elsevier.com/icarus/default.asp

Please note that we will only be accepting new (not revised)
submissions and their subsequent revisions on the new Elsevier
Editorial System.  All manuscripts that are currently in progress
(submitted prior to 1 August 2008) will continue to be processed and
handled via the "old" Cornell-based Icarus submission system

(http://icarus.cornell.edu/)

Those authors who are working on revisions to manuscripts submitted
prior to 1 August 2008, but who have not yet submitted a revised
manuscript, should do so using the "old" system before 31 October
2008. This is so that the editorial processing of those manuscripts
can be completed before the Editorial Office moves toward retiring the
"old" Cornell-based server.

We ask for your patience and understanding as we transition to and
learn the new Elsevier Editorial System, and as we maintain two
separate manuscript submission programs for the next several months
during this transitional period.

NEW RESOURCE GUIDE ON WOMEN IN ASTRONOMY AT THE ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY 
OF THE PACIFIC WEBSITE

An updated, expanded resource guide to the role women have played and
are playing in the development of astronomy is now available on the
web-site of the non-profit Astronomical Society of the Pacific:

http://www.astrosociety.org/education/resources/womenast_bib.html

The guide includes both printed and web-based materials, and has
general references on the topic plus specific references to the work
and lives of 32 women astronomers of the past and present.  All the 
materials are at the non-technical level and thus appropriate for 
student papers, curriculum development, or personal enrichment.

The guide makes reference to 178 different web resources, as well as
books and articles that are either in print or found in many larger 
libraries.

This resource guide is part of a series that can be found on the 
Society's web-site, on such topics as the astronomy of many cultures,
debunking astronomical pseudo-science, and resources for astronomy
education.

FALL AGU UNION SESSION ON COMPARATIVE CLIMATE STUDIES OF EARTH, VENUS 
AND MARS

Please consider submitting an abstract to the Fall AGU meeting in San 
Francisco:

Union Session U11: Comparative Climate Studies of Earth, Venus and Mars

Conveners: David Grinspoon, Brian Toon and Janet Luhmann
Abstract deadline: September 10

Venus and Mars are Earth's nearest planetary neighbors and provide the 
closest analogs for many important climate processes. Venus, with its 
runaway greenhouse atmosphere and Mars, with its record of orbitally 
driven climate cycles, represent extreme examples of nonlinear climate 
evolution. What challenges are encountered, and insights gained, in 
adapting terrestrial climate and circulation models to Mars and Venus? 
What lessons do the divergent climate histories of these three planets 
hold for Earth's long term evolution? Motivated by recent advances in 
modeling of Earth's climate system, along with relevant new data sets 
from several recent Mars missions and the Venus Express spacecraft, 
this session will cover comparative studies of the climates, and 
climate-related processes, on these three planets. Suggested topics 
include: atmospheric dynamics; radiative balance; solar cycle 
responses; cloud microphysics, structure and radiative forcings;
volcano-climate interactions, polar processes and feedbacks between 
any of the above phenomena.

FALL AGU SESSION P16: COMPARISON OF BASALTIC VOLCANISM ON MARS AND THE
EARTH
 
The Earth and Mars both display evidence of extensive basaltic 
volcanism throughout their geologic history in the form of large shield
volcanoes, fields of smaller monogenetic vent fields, and extensive 
plains of overlapping, thick lava deposits. Often the morphologies are
similar, thereby enabling inferences to be drawn about both planets'
history of basalt generation, ascension, and eruption. The purpose of 
this proposed session is to present a comparison of basaltic features 
on the Earth and Mars as a basis for characterizing and contrasting 
their styles of basaltic volcanism. See URL:

"EUROPA LANDER: SCIENCE GOALS AND EXPERIMENTS" FIRST ANNOUNCEMENT: 
INTERNATIONAL WORKSHOP

9-13 February 2009, Space Research Institute (IKI), Moscow, Russia

http://www.iki.rssi.ru/conf/2009elw

The Europa lander workshop will be hosted by the Space Research 
Institute (IKI) of Russian Academy of Sciences in Moscow, Russia, 
from 9 to 13 February 2009. The workshop will last 5 days including 
the days of arrival/departure (and some sightseeing events) and 
consists of several sessions dedicated to the scientific goals and 
logistics of the project, key issues of Europa science with the 
special emphasis on astrobiology, and discussions of the requirements 
for scientific instruments.

We kindly ask all colleagues interested in participation of Europa 
Lander workshop to preregister preliminarily before September 25 
2008, at the meeting website.

REMINDER:  HIRISE SPECIAL ISSUE OF ICARUS

The deadline for submission of manuscripts to the special MRO HiRISE 
issue of Icarus is October 20, 2008.  Online publication is planned 
for spring 2009 and print publication in fall 2009.  We especially 
encourage contributions from outside of the HiRISE team.  

NOTE:  Icarus has a new online submission system.  Information 
regarding submission of manuscripts to Icarus may be found at:

http://ees.elsevier.com/icarus/default.asp

Questions and indication of interest regarding contributions to the 
HiRISE special issue should be addressed to the guest editors, Laz 
Keszthelyi and Ken Herkenhoff:

DRILLING SYSTEMS FOR EXTRATERRESTRIAL SUBSURFACE EXPLORATION

Increasingly, in-situ exploration missions include acquisition and 
analysis of planetary samples. The lessons learned from the Phoenix and 
MSL highlighted the challenges to sampling and necessitated making
significant compromises. 

The heritage and the under development drilling technology are the
subject of an extensive review article that was published in the 
August issue of the J. of Astrobiology, co-authored by Zacny et al.  

The article can be downloaded from

INAUGURAL SMALL BODIES ASSESSMENT GROUP (SBAG) MEETING

The Small Bodies Assessment Group (SBAG) will meet September 23-24, 
2008, at the Lunar and Planetary Institute, 3600 Bay Area Boulevard, 
Houston, Texas.

There will be a review of the general status and future plans for 
programs supporting small bodies research at NASA, the International 
Primitive Body Exploration Working Group (IPEWG), and current and 
planned missions to small bodies. 

Work will begin on a white paper on the direction of small bodies 
exploration for the next decade. There will be break-out sessions to 
consider specific topics for this planning document.

Anyone interested in small bodies science is invited to participate. 
There is no fee, but registration is required. Deadline for 
registration is September 15, 2008. Go to

http://www.lpi.usra.edu/meetings/sbag2008/reg/
