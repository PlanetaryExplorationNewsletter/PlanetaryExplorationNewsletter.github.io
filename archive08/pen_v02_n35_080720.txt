NASA: FY 2008 NRA COMPETITIVE PROGRAM FOR SCIENCE MUSEUMS AND
PLANETARIUMS RELEASED

The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has released 
the FY 2008 NASA Research Announcement (NRA) Competitive Program for 
Science Museums and Planetariums (CP4SMP). Each funded CP4SMP proposal
is expected to establish informal education projects or exhibits led by
museums, science centers, or planetariums that feature eligible NASA 
missions, science, engineering, explorations, or technologies.

This NRA seeks proposals featuring NASA-themed content in space 
exploration, aeronautics, space science, Earth science, or 
microgravity, or a combination of these Congressionally-directed 
topics to support NASA education outcomes.  Leadership of the proposed
projects must reside at institutions of informal education; partnership
relationships are highly encouraged.

The solicitation, Announcement Number NNH08ZNE006N, may be accessed
through the NASA Solicitation and Proposal Integrated Review and 
Evaluation System (NSPIRES) at:

NASA: NEW PROPOSAL OPPORTUNITY FOR KEPLER GUEST OBSERVER CYCLE 1

ROSES-08 Amendment 18

This amendment announces a new proposal opportunity in Appendix D.9 
entitled Kepler Guest Observer Cycle 1. This program element solicits 
proposals for the acquisition and analysis of new scientific data from
the Kepler mission, which will be the tenth NASA Discovery Programï
mission. 

Observations associated with the Kepler Guest Observer - Cycle 1 
solicitation will begin immediately following the successful 
scientific commissioning of the spacecraft. During its 3.5-year prime
mission, Kepler will continuously monitor a ~100 square degree 
field-of-view in the Cygnus region, with the objective of 
photometrically detecting transits of Earth-size planets in the 
habitable zone. Proposals submitted to this program should be for new 
observations only and should address areas of astrophysics outside the
exoplanet transit survey Key Project already planned by the mission.

Notices of Intent (NOIs) due September 5, 2008. 
Proposals due October 24, 2008.

On or about July 17, 2008, this Amendment to the  NASA Research 
Announcement "Research Opportunities in Space and Earth Sciences 
(ROSES) 2008" (NNH08ZDA001N) will be posted on the NASA research
opportunity homepage at:

http://nspires.nasaprs.com/ 

(select Solicitations then Open Solicitations then NNH08ZDA001N).

NASA RELEASES FY 2008 NRA K-12 COMPETITIVE GRANTS OPPORTUNITY

The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has released
the FY 2008 NASA Research Announcement for the NASA K-12 Competitive
Grants (K12CG).   NASA solicits proposals using NASA-themed content
in support of secondary level teaching and learning, with a
particular emphasis on high school education.  Each funded proposal
is expected to leverage NASA's unique contributions in science,
technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) to enhance students'
academic experiences and/or to improve educators' abilities to engage
and stimulate their students.  Proposed work must be grounded in
education research and/or best practices, and incorporate formative,
summative, and other evaluations, as appropriate.

accordance with the project archive plan, CDR (calibrated) data from
the MDIS, MAG, and MASCS instruments from the Mercury 1, Venus 2, and
Earth flybys are included in this release.  The remaining instruments
will provide calibrated data for all of the flybys to date in release
5, scheduled for 15 March 2010.

Data sets from the following experiments are now available:

EPPS (Energetic Particle and Plasma Spectrometer) 
GRNS (Gamma Ray and Neutron Spectrometer) 
MAG (Magnetometer) 
MASCS (Mercury Atmosphere and Surface Composition Spectrometer) 
MDIS(Mercury Dual Imaging System) 
MLA (Mercury Laser Altimeter) 
XRS (X-Ray Spectrometer) 
RS (Radio Science)

SPICE data for the mission to date are also included.

The data can be accessed from:

ANNOUNCEMENT: MARS CLIMATE MODELING CENTER WORKSHOP

30 September through 2 October 2008
NASA Ames Research Center, Moffett Field, California

The Space Science and Astrobiology Division of NASA Ames Research 
Center, and the Planetary Science Division of NASA's Science Mission 
Directorate, wish to cordially invite your participation in a planning
and purposes workshop for the establishment of a Mars Climate 
Modeling Center (MCMC) at the NASA Ames Research Center, Moffett 
Field, California.

The theme of this workshop is to openly discuss the needs of the 
Agency regarding a national center for Mars climate modeling and 
research in support of its Mars Exploration Program, and further, to 
establish an efficient resource for the Mars science and mission 
engineering communities.

We encourage participation in the MCMC workshop from Mars atmospheric 
and climate scientists; Mars mission, engineering and support 
personnel; NASA High-End Computing members; and, others broadly 
interested in Mars climate research.

The workshop webpage: 

http://mcmcworkshop.arc.nasa.gov) 

will "go live" on 29 July 2008. We hope you will be able to attend
and participate in the MCMC workshop this autumn.
