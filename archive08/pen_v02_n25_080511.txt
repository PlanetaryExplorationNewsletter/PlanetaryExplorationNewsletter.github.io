[NASA] CANCELLATION OF SPACE POLICY RESEARCH PROGRAM 

The program element entitled "Space Policy Research" in Appendix E.6 of
Research Opportunities in Space and Earth Sciences (ROSES) - 2008 is
cancelled. At this time, the SMD program cannot support new 
investigations in this area.  No Space Policy Research investigations 
will be solicited at this time.

Go to http://nspires.nasaprs.com/ and select "Solicitations" then "Open
Solicitations" then "NNH08ZDA001N".

Further information about this program element is available from 
Dr. T. Jens Feeley, Science Mission Directorate, NASA, Washington, DC

LUNAR EXPLORATION ROADMAP - INPUT NEEDED

The Lunar Exploration Analysis Group (LEAG) (see 
http://www.lpi.usra.edu/leag) has been tasked by the NASA Advisory 
Council to develop a Lunar Exploration Roadmap for NASA.

To this end, the LEAG Executive Committee has developed a series of 
Themes and Goals that will be broken down into Investigations by 
Specific Action Teams (SATs). To aid in the development of the 
Exploration Roadmap, we are soliciting input from the lunar and broader 
LEAG communities.

Specifically, we are asking that you visit the following website and 
comment upon the Themes and Goals. This input will be used by the SATs 
in their work on developing the investigations that go with the 
different goals.

The details for accessing the web site are as follows:

URL:  https://www.lpi.usra.edu/survey/LEAG_ThemesGoals/

Username: leag
Password: moonorbust

Please note that there will be other opportunities for community 
input as we further develop this very important roadmap.

On behalf of the LEAG, I thank you for helping us in this endeavour.

Sincerely,

Clive R. Neal
LEAG Chair

OUTER PLANETS FLAGSHIP MISSION INSTRUMENT WORKSHOP

Monrovia, California
June 3-5, 2008

This is the 2nd announcement and call for instrument papers for the 
OPFM Instrument Workshop.  All instrument providers planning to respond 
to the NASA or ESA announcements of opportunity anticipated in 2009 are 
strongly encouraged to participate in this workshop for an overview of 
both Europa/Jupiter System Mission and the Titan/Saturn System Mission 
studies, as well as overviews of the environmental and planetary 
protection constraints that will impact instrument design and 
development.  A decision by NASA/ESA is expected in November 2008 on 
which flagship mission will go forward.

The workshop is also soliciting contributed papers from potential 
instrument providers.  Instrument papers will be given oral time for a 
summary and an extended poster session for detailed discussion.  The 
deadline for online abstract submission is May 16.

There is no fee for this workshop, but registration is mandatory for 
planning purposes.  Please go to this URL for registration and 
instrument abstract submission:

SECOND ANNOUNCEMENT: COSMIC CATACLYSMS AND LIFE

Location: ESRIN, Frascati, Italy 
Date: 10-14 November 2008

Abstract Deadline: 17 June 2008

A number of cataclysms have occurred in the history of the universe and 
the Solar System. The Symposium will review those that had a critical 
influence on the evolution of habitable worlds and on the emergence and 
survival of life on Earth, and possibly elsewhere.  The sessions will 
discuss the following topics:

- Big Bang and the formation of light elements, element nucleosynthesis 
in stars and Supernovae
- Violent processes in star formation, interstellar/circumstellar 
shocks and the synthesis of molecules
- Collisions and planetary formation
- Formation of the Moon and its influence on Earth
- Late heavy bombardment and the emergence of life
- The role of impacts in inhibiting, transporting or threatening life
- Hazards from stellar flares and space weather
- Hazards from black holes and gamma ray bursts
- Cosmic habitability, prevalence of Earth-like planets, the fate of 
the Earth
- Historical, outreach and education aspects of cataclysms (e.g. 
Tunguska 1908)

Updated information about the Workshop will be made on the web site:

PLANETARY PUMELLING: CATACLYSMIC BOMBARDMENT OF THE SOLAR SYSTEM AS 
CATASTROPHE, CATALYST, CAULDRON AND CRICIBLE (GSA TECHNICAL SESSION 
T96)

Abstract deadline: June 3

Even as we approach the 40th anniversary of Apollo 11, one of the more 
remarkable results to come out of lunar sample analyses is the 
hypothesis that a large number of impact events occurred on the Moon 
during a narrow window in time approximately 3.8 to 4.1 billion years 
ago (the lunar "cataclysm"). Subsequent work on the lunar and martian 
meteorite suites; remote sensing of the Moon, Mars, asteroids, and icy 
satellites; improved dynamical modeling; and investigation of 
terrestrial zircons extend the cataclysm hypothesis to the Earth, other 
terrestrial planets, and possibly the entire solar system. Renewed US 
and international interest in exploring the Moon offers new potential 
to constrain the Earth-Moon bombardment history. In light of these 
opportunities, this session invites the latest views on the evidence, 
timing and mechanism for cataclysmic bombardment of the solar system 
and its effects on the nascent Earth, including evidence in terrestrial 
rocks, effects on terrestrial systems (biosphere, hydrosphere, 
lithosphere), and questions that may be answered in a new age of 
exploration.

TITAN GEOLOGY: A NEW FRONTIER (GSA TECHNICAL SESSION T109)

Abstract Deadline: June 3

Titan, Saturn's largest moon, is a dynamic, Earth-like body. Clouds and 
rain, rivers and lakes, cryovolcanoes, and vast aeolian dunes all shape 
its surface. These geologic phenomena give Titan a strikingly 
terrestrial-style geomorphology, so that significant advances in 
understanding Titan are being made through analogy to terrestrial 
processes. Yet the materials observed spectroscopically in these 
processes are exotic by terran standards: Titan's crustal material is 
water ice, and its atmosphere synthesizes complex hydrocarbon organics. 

The juxtaposition of Earth-like processes and exotic materials makes 
Titan a unique opportunity in comparative geologic studies. This 
session will discuss Titan's varied geologic processes and their 
resultant landforms, including surface-atmosphere and 
surface-subsurface interactions. 

Contributions analyzing Cassini data, ground-based observations, 
terrestrial analogs, and laboratory studies, including geochemical 
analogues to early Earth, are all welcome.
