[NASA] EVALUATION AND SELECTION OF SMALL COMPLETE MISSIONS IN 
ASTROBIOLOGY AND FUNDAMENTAL SPACE BIOLOGY
 
With this amendment, the NASA Announcement of Opportunity
NNH08ZDA009O, "Stand Alone Missions of Opportunity Notice (SALMON),"
has been amended to clarify the evaluation and selection process
for proposals submitted in response to Program Element Appendix H3:
Small Complete Missions of Opportunity in Astrobiology and Fundamental
Space Biology.

For Small Complete Missions in Fundamental Space Biology, the minimum
unencumbered cost reserve required for Phase A through Phase D is
reduced to 15%.

An accommodation study performed by the MicroNano Spacecraft and
Payloads Office at NASA Ames Research Center will take the place of
the technical, management, and cost (TMC) feasibility, including
cost risk, evaluation.

The merit of data being added to the Planetary Data System is 
removed as an evaluation factor.

Technical or scientific questions may be addressed to the 
points-of-contact given at the end of Program Element Appendix 
H3 of the SALMON AO.

Programmatic questions concerning the SALMON AO may be addressed 
to Dr. Carlos Liceaga, (757) 846-5880; salmonao@nasa.gov.
