PHOENIX TO LAND ON MARS TODAY, MAY 25

The Phoenix is targetted to land in the northern Martian arctic where
water ice is thought to exist just below the surface. It will dig through
the surface to study the soil and ice and determine whether life ever
arose on Mars and other science goals.

PEN CELEBRATES FIRST ANNIVERSARY

The first issue of the Planetary Exploration Newsletter was distributed
May 24, 2007. In that time, PEN has grown to more than 1340 subscribers 
from the planetary science community around the world, and continues
to grow. PEN exists to serve this community. Among services added this
first year is the most extensive international calendar of 
planetary-related meetings, workshops and conferences. Your ideas for 
improvements are always welcome. Send them to pen_editor at psi.edu.

[NASA] FINAL TEXT FOR APPLIED INFORMATION SYSTEMS RESEARCH

This amendment provides the final text for Appendix E.2 entitled 
"Applied Information Systems Research." The purpose of the Applied 
Information Systems Research (AISR) program is to evolve advances in 
computer and information science and technology to enhance science 
productivity of NASA's Science Mission Directorate (SMD). AISR seeks 
innovative ideas for applying advanced information and related 
technologies to increase life cycle effectiveness and efficiency of 
research endeavors conducted by SMD research programs in Planetary 
Science, Heliophysics, Astrophysics, and Earth Science.

The due dates for AISR have been delayed approximately 1 month. 
Notices of Intent (NOIs) to propose are now due June 30, 1008. 
Proposals are now due August 27, 2008.

On or about May 22, 2008, this Amendment to the NASA Research 
Announcement "Research Opportunities in Space and Earth Sciences 
(ROSES) 2008" (NNH08ZDA001N) will be posted on the NASA research 
opportunity homepage at 

http://nspires.nasaprs.com/ (select "Solicitations" then "Open 
Solicitations" then "NNH08ZDA001N").

EPSC 2008 SB6: "COMETS, ASTEROIDS, AND TNOS" CALL-FOR-ABSTRACTS

We would like to invite all colleagues interested in the research on
comets, asteroids and trans-neptunian objects to participate in the
following session at the European Planetary Science Congress (EPSC 
2008) to be held in Muenster, Germany, 21-26 September 2008:

SB6 - Comets, Asteroids and TNOs

The scope of this session covers all aspects of comets, asteroids and
TNOs including modelling techniques. This session is intended to 
reflect developments in this research field on a broad basis.
You are invited to present your recent results related to past and
on-going space missions, future space instrumentation, observational
studies of comets, asteroids and TNOs from the ground and from space,
including laboratory simulation and theoretical modelling.

For general information on the conference and online abstract 
submission (deadline June, 1), please visit the web site:

GSA TECHNICAL SESSION T105: PREPARATIONS FOR THE NEW ERA OF LUNAR 
SCIENCE - CALL FOR ABSTRACTS

Abstract Deadline: June 3, 2008

Meeting: Oct. 5-9, Houston, TX

https://www.acsmeetings.org/

Ongoing and upcoming orbital lunar missions will provide scientists 
with an unprecedented amount of remote sensing lunar data. Together
with these orbital missions, a variety of sample studies utilizing a
host of materials are being performed in state of the art facilities
around the world. These diverse laboratory measurements of lunar
samples and analogues are resulting in significant improvements in our
understanding of the complex geologic history of the Moon and will be
used to guide our interpretations of the new remotely sensed data sets.

Papers presented may address the following: 
What are current laboratory analyses revealing about the geologic 
history of the Moon?  
How will laboratory measurements be used to inform our interpretations
of the lunar data returned by orbiting spacecraft in the upcoming
years?
What are the limitations of the data, both from the laboratory and
from the instruments themselves?
What measurements still need to be made in the laboratory in 
preparation for the new data and why? 
How were the instruments calibrated on the Earth or in orbit?
