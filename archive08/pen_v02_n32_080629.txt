EARLY SOLAR SYSTEM IMPACT BOMBARDMENT WORKSHOP

Lunar and Planetary Institute (LPI), Houston, Texas
September 15-17, 2008

One of the legacies of the Apollo program is the concept of late heavy
bombardment or a lunar cataclysm that may have resurfaced the Moon and
thermally metamorphosed its crust. The source of the debris is 
variously described as being from the asteroid or Kuiper belts, which 
implies any bombardment may have affected planetary surfaces throughout
the solar system.

Recognizing the community's interest in the topic, the Lunar and 
Planetary Institute and NASA are organizing a workshop to explore this
theme. Topics will include an assessment of the geologic record of 
impact cratering throughout the solar system, cosmochemical constraints
on any early bombardment, and dynamic models that might explain the 
flux of debris and potential changes in the flux of debris. It is hoped
that the discussion will be informed by observations elsewhere, like 
Mercury, Mars, the asteroid belt, and outer solar system moons.
