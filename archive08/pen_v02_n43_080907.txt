PLANETARY GEOMORPHOLOGY IMAGE OF THE MONTH

The September 'Image of the Month' is now available at the IAG's 
Planetary Geomorphology web page

http://www.psi.edu/pgwg/images/sep08image.html

This month's topic is Yardangs on Earth and Mars

The images and information are a free educational resource provided to 
encourage the inclusion of planetary geomorphology topics in 
curriculum. They are also intended to stimulate collaboration between 
geomorphologists studying Earth landforms and those who focus primarily 
on other planetary surfaces.

If you would like to contribute an image (Earth analogs are welcome) 
please contact mbourke@psi.edu

Past images and captions are available at

FALL AGU SESSION ON PROSPECTS FOR HABITABILITY ON NOACHIAN MARS

One of the highlights of Mars sciece over the last several years is 
recognition of a diversity of aqueous deposits preserved in Mars' 
Noachian rocks. 

We are co-convening a session at AGU (P07) entitled "Prospects for 
Habitability on Noachian Mars". We would like to encourage your 
contribution of abstracts related to mineralogic, geomorphic and 
geophysical constraints on Mars' habitability during this period of the 
planet's history.

A description of the session is below at the url and following it in 
plain text.

SessionSearch/?show=detail&sessid=317

Remember the deadline for AGU abstract submission is 10 Sept 2008, 
in 6 more days.

Thanks and we look forward to seeing you in San Francisco,

Scott Murchie and John Mustard

NASA PROPOSAL WRITING WORKSHIP AT DPS

Discipline scientists at NASA Headquarters will host a proposal writing
workshop at the DPS meeting this fall that may be of interest to you,
your colleagues, or your graduate students.  The workshop will be held
on Friday, October 10, from 1-5 pm at the conference hotel in Ithaca.
The workshop is open to all interested planetary scientists from
graduate students on up and is free of charge. The workshop will focus
on understanding NASA's research programs and will include information
on how to write a research proposal, where to apply for funding, and
what kind of feedback one can expect. Other opportunities for funding,
such as participating scientist programs and education/public outreach
add-on awards, will also be discussed. 

To register, send an e-mail with your name, affiliation, and current 
position to curt.niebur@nasa.gov.
