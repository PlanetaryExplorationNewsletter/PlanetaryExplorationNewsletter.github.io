[NASA] DUE DATE FOR PLANETARY PROTECTION RESEARCH PROPOSALS

The Planetary Protection Research component of ROSES, element C.18, 
is soliciting proposals that address aspects of planetary protection 
not covered in other ROSES elements.  Of particular interest for this
call are proposals to investigate 1) the limits of life in planetary 
environments; 2) modelling transport mechanisms to planetary surfaces 
or subsurfaces; 3) adaptation of sensitive molecular or biochemical 
detection technologies for planetary protection purposes; and 4) novel
or improved spacecraft sterilization technologies.

The research announcement is available at:

init&solId={17B3B3FF-EBBC-4349-A25A-9E823EEFC347}&path=open

Proposals are due to NSPIRES on Sept. 5th, 2008.

Questions may be addressed to Dr. Catharine Conley, Planetary 
Protection Officer, NASA Science Mission Directorate, 
Phone: 202-358-3912, Email: Cassie.Conley@nasa.gov.

[NASA] THREE-DAY TRAINING COURSE ON PLANETARY PROTECTION

Course: "Planetary Protection: Policies and Practices"

Dates: October 7-9, 2008

Location: Center of Marine Biotechnology, Baltimore, Maryland

We cordially invite all interested parties to participate in the 
upcoming course on Planetary Protection Policies and Practices, which 
is designed to familiarize current and future practitioners with NASA 
and COSPAR planetary protection programs.  The course provides an 
overview of applicable policies, practices and procedures necessary 
to implement a successful planetary protection program, emphasizing 
integration of managerial, administrative, and laboratory activities. 
It is supported by the NASA Planetary Protection Officer and the NASA 
Astrobiology Institute.

[NASA] BETA TEST OF NEW PLANETARY DATA SYSTEM MAIN WEB SITE

The Planetary Data System main web site is about to undergo a  
revision designed to make data and tools easier for researchers to  
find. You can help make this revision better by trying out the beta  
test version of the site and sending feedback on any problems you  
encounter or suggestions for further improvement.

Visit the beta test site at: 

http://pdsbeta.jpl.nasa.gov/

Send feedback to Mark Rose at NASA Ames Research Center  
(Mark.Rose@nasa.gov) or use the link on the front page of the beta  
test site.

FALL AGU SESSION: EVOLUTION OF PLANETARY ATMOSPHERES

2008 Fall AGU Meeting, San Francisco, December 15-19
Abstract submission deadline: September 10th, 2008

P08: Evolution of Planetary Atmospheres  
Sponsor:  Planetary Sciences
CoSponsor:  Atmospheric Sciences
Convener:  Feng Tian (MIT/EAPS), James F. Kasting (PSU)

Understanding the evolutionary histories of planetary atmospheres 
is one of the key scientific questions driving planetary mission 
planning. While the evolution of our own planet, the Earth, is 
constrained by geological and geochemical data, the evolutionary 
paths of other planetary bodies in and outside our solar system must 
be constrained by planetary mission data and astronomical observations.
The recent discoveries of extrasolar planets greatly expand the 
interests of the scientific community and provide a new opportunity for
interdisciplinary collaborations between geoscientists, astronomers,
and planetary scientists. The session welcomes both observational and 
theoretical studies which are relevant to the grand theme of the 
atmosphere evolution of planetary objects in and outside of our solar 
system (including the Earth).

HUBBLE OUTREACH COORDINATOR, EUROPEAN SOUTHERN OBSERVATORY

You will work within a newly merged group (ESO-Hubble public outreach)
being responsible for the European Hubble outreach activities, i.e.
managing the production of press releases, visuals, web pages etc.

Based on agreements between ESA, NASA and ESO, the European public
outreach for the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope is carried out at the
ESO headquarters in Garching bei Muenchen, Germany. The Secretariat for
the International Year of Astronomy 2009 and the press office for the
International Astronomical Union are also part of ESO-Hubble public
outreach. The combined outreach activities make ESO an exciting centre
for astronomy outreach and education in the world. The group is very
strong in the production of astronomical images, exhibitions, HD video
products (e.g. video podcasts, video compilations) and powerful
educational programmes.

The Hubble Outreach Coordinator will report to the Head of Outreach and
will perform the following duties:
-Production of news, photo and video podcasts.
-Writing of educational material.
-Oversee the integration of written and visual material.
-Preparation of event-related outreach material (e.g. press kits) and
support of external requests from journalists, scientists and the
general public.

POSITION AT MARSHALL SPACE FLIGHT CENTER IN LUNAR AND PLANETARY SCIENCE

I would like to draw your attention to a open civil servant position  
at Marshall Space Flight Center in lunar and planetary science.  
Please forward this to anyone who might be interested and feel free  
to contact me directly if you have any questions. I've been at MSFC  
nearly a year and am thoroughly enjoying it.

The position consists of two distinct elements, a research element  
and a programmatic element. The research element involves studying  
the origin, composition, structure, and evolution of the bodies of  
the solar system such as the planets and their satellites, asteroids,  
meteorites, and comets. Programmatic responsibilities include serving  
as a scientific advisor to the NASA Lunar Precursor Robotics Program  
Office for the purpose of developing scientific strategies, goals and  
objectives and accomplishing exploration-directed tasks.

You must apply through the USAJobs.gov web site by September 2. Go to:
