[NASA] REQUEST FOR INFORMATION - INSTRUMENTS FOR LADEE LUNAR MISSION

Instruments for the LADEE Lunar Mission
Lunar Science Program, Science Mission Directorate, NASA
Solicitation Number: NNH08ZDA006L
Release Date: March 24, 2008
Response Date: April 18, 2008

The Government is seeking information regarding existing instruments
(such as flight spares and engineering models) that could be quickly
flight qualified, accommodated, and flown on the Lunar Atmosphere and
Dust Environment Explorer (LADEE), scheduled for a 2010-2011 launch.
The Government is also interested in potential "build to print"
possibilities from existing flight instruments, in the event that
there are no flight spares available. In particular, the Government
is seeking capable neutral mass spectrometers and sensitive dust
detectors for this opportunity. However other available lightweight
instrument types that could provide alternative data sets to address
the composition and structure of the tenuous lunar atmosphere, or the
presence and distribution of dust above the lunar surface, will also
be considered.

The complete RFI including background, requested information, and
instructions for responding may be found at:

Information (NNH08ZDA006L): Instruments for LADEE Lunar Mission").

[NASA] REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS TO ADMINISTER TEACHING FROM SPACE (TFS)

The NASA JSC Office of Education invites proposals to administer 
Teaching From Space (TFS), located at the NASA Johnson Space Center, 
Houston, Texas. As part of NASA's portfolio of education programs and 
projects, TFS facilitates and manage s NASA education activities that 
help the Agency achieve its education goals. These activities offer 
NASA Education unique capabilities and opportunities to involve 
educators and students through astronaut training, spaceflight 
missions, on-orbit education activities, future flight platforms and 
space missions, and a variety of education flight projects. The vision 
for TFS is: Facilitate education opportunities that use the unique 
environment of spaceflight and other flight platforms. TFS will focus 
on three objectives:

1. Develop and provide NASA-unique experiences, opportunities, content, 
and resources to educators and students to increase K-12 student 
interest in STEM disciplines.

2. Develop and facilitate a network of highly motivated educators.

3. Build internal and external partnerships with formal and informal 
education communities to create unique learning opportunities and 
professional development experiences.

Organizations eligible to respond to this CAN are limited to higher 
education institutions, non-profit organizations, or consortia of 
organizations and institutions serving higher education.

NOIs due: March 28, 2008 
Proposals due: April 28, 2008

[NASA] MOVING SAMPLE ANALYSIS PROPOSALS FROM PMDAP TO SRLIDAP

The responsibility for supporting investigations that involve the 
analysis of samples, including the analysis of samples returned by 
NASA's planetary science missions to Earth such as Genesis and 
Stardust, is moved from the Planetary Mission Data Analysis program 
(PMDAP) described in Appendix C.11 to the Sample Return Laboratory 
Instrumentation and Data Analysis program (SRLIDAP) described in 
Appendix C.3. The funding required for the support of sample analysis 
investigations has also been moved from PMDAP to SRLIDAP.
