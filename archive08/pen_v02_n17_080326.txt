SPECIAL:  FROM JAMES GREEN, DIRECTOR PLANETARY SCIENCE DIVISION -
CHANGES AT NASA HEADQUARTERS

If you have not heard, Alan Stern has resigned at NASA Headquarters. 
As Associate Administrator for the Science Mission Directorate, Alan 
was a tremendous driving force for positive change. He made many really 
tough decisions with a full commitment and stood by his people at all 
times. What an absolutely historic year this has been. I can only tell 
you that I thoroughly enjoyed working with Alan and that it has been 
the highlight in my very long NASA career. Alan is just outstanding in 
every way. I feel I have lost my best boss and gained a great friend 
at the same time. Although he won't be down the hall he will return to 
our planetary science community. Dr. Ed Weiler director of NASA's 
Goddard Space Flight Center, has been named as interim Associate 
Administrator. I have known Dr. Weiler for many years and I am 
delighted that he will be coming back to Headquarters. From my 
perspective, the Planetary Science Division continues to have a very 
bright and stable future with tremendously exciting science missions 
in all stages of development and operation. We have an outstanding 
staff of people who are committed to the path we are on and are ready 
to face each and every challenge ahead and that has not changed.
