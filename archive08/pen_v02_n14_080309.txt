[CORRECTION] NASA REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ON SCIENTIST PARTICIPANT 
SUBORBITAL SCIENCE PILOT PROGRAM - FLIGHT RESEARCH

[Editor Note: In last week's PEN, we directed people to the wrong URL
for the complete announcement and directions. The correct URL is
http://prod.nais.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/eps/synopsis.cgi?acqid=128947 ]

The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) recognizes the
advancement of the commercial suborbital spaceflight industry and
requests information on potential human-tended flight experiments
enabled by this capability. NASA's Science Mission Directorate (SMD) is
in the formulation phase of a possible new program to fly government-
sponsored payloads and researchers on commercial suborbital systems
with the intent of advancing SMD's goals and objectives.  

Responses to this RFI (NNH08ZDA004L) will be used to inform NASA's 
program planning.

[NASA] LIST OF PLANNED SOLICITATIONS

The NASA Science Mission Directorate (SMD) is planning to release
several solicitations in the next two years, including Announcements
of Opportunity (AOs), Cooperative Agreement Notices (CANs), and the
ROSES NASA Research Announcement (NRA).  SMD's current snapshot of
planning for future solicitations through mid-2009 has been posted on
the SARA website at:

http://science.hq.nasa.gov/research/sara_grant_sols.html 

Select "Planned SMD Solicitations" in the middle of the page.

This snapshot includes the expected dates of release for upcoming
solicitations, to the extent that they are currently known.

It is NASA's intention that this planning list will be updated
whenever changes in the planning dates for future solicitations are
announced. Community members are encouraged to check the SARA 
website for the current planning dates for AOs.

For further information on NASA's planning for future solicitations,
please contact Dr. Paul Hertz, Science Mission Directorate, NASA,
Washington, DC 20546; email at paul.hertz@nasa.gov.

LUNAR SCIENCE INSTITUTE (NLSI) OFFICIALLY OPEN

NASAs new Lunar Science Institute (NLSI) is officially open for 
business. Supported by the NASA Science Mission Directorate (SMD) and 
the Exploration Systems Mission Directorate (ESMD), NLSI is managed by
NASA Ames Research Center and is modeled on the NASA Astrobiology
Institute. Competitively selected team investigations will focus on one 
or more aspects of lunar science -- investigations of the Moon 
(including lunar samples), from the Moon, and/or on the Moon.

AMERICAN ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY DYNAMICAL ASTRONOMY MEETING

The 2008 Meeting of the American Astronomical Society's Division on
Dynamical Astronomy (DDA) will be held April 28 through May 1, 2008,
in Boulder, Colorado. The annual DDA meeting brings together top
researchers in astronomy, astrophysics, planetary science and
astrodynamics for in-depth and stimulating discussions and talks on
all aspects of dynamics in the space sciences.  This year's meeting
features invited talks by Drs. Simon White (Brouwer Prize winner),
Fritz Benedict, Brett Gladman, Kathryn Johnston, Frederic Masset,
David Nesvorny, and Doug Richstone, and a public talk by Dr. Carolyn
Porco. All contributed talks at the DDA will be given in plenary
session at the St. Julien hotel in downtown Boulder. There will be a
poster session at Southwest Research Institute (SwRI), which is
located next door to the St. Julien. This year's meeting is sponsored
by SwRI, Space Science Institute, Colorado University's Colorado
Center for Astrodynamics Research and Laboratory for Atmospheric and
Space Physics, and Ball Aerospace.

meeting is sponsored by the Cassini-Huygens Project and includes 
support from ESA, NASA, Imperial College, STFC.  The primary purpose 
of the meeting is to exchange ideas that will culminate in the 
publication of a Springer-Verlag book on the Saturn system.  The 
meeting is open to interested members of the planetary science 
community.

TITAN AFTER CASSINI-HUYGENS

The Titan Book Symposium, which will be held at the Omni Hotel Bayfront
Tower in Corpus Christi, TX, July 7-11, 2008, will scientifically 
examine the Cassini-Huygens mission to Titan along with ground based 
observational and theoretical supporting studies for the purpose of 
writing a book on Titan. The book, to be published by Springer-Verlag, 
is targeted for publication in late 2009. A secondary purpose of the 
meeting is to hold a one-day symposium of future Titan missions with 
emphasis on the Titan Explorer flagship proposal and participation by 
interested industrial parties.

late registration fee of $550.00 will follow through the date of the 
conference.
