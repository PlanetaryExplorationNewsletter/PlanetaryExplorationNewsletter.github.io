[NASA] OFFERS MISSION PI TRAINING COURSE

NASA Science Mission Directorate to Sponsor NASA Academy of Program,
Project, and Engineering Leadership (APPEL) Mission Principal
Investigator Training Course.

Beginning in 2008, the NASA Science Mission Directorate (SMD) will be
sponsoring a series of offerings of a one-week Mission Principal
Investigator (PI) Training Course to help mission PIs lead NASA
science missions more effectively.

The Mission PI Training Course has been developed and will be
delivered by the NASA Academy of Program, Project and Engineering
Leadership (APPEL) under the direction of Dr. Edward Hoffman of the
Office of the Chief Engineer.  The course will cover material
including the responsibilities of the PI, NASA policies and
directives, project life cycles and reviews, project management and
systems engineering, project assessment and control, NASA-provided
services, and project-centered leadership fundamentals.  The initial
course offering is planned for June 15-20, 2008 at a soon to be
announced location convenient to the Washington, DC area. The course
will subsequently be offered three or more times per year.

Mission PIs have full responsibility for the scientific integrity and
all other aspects of their missions including the execution of the
mission investigation within the committed cost and schedule.  Due to
this level of responsibility, existing mission PIs will have a
mandatory requirement to complete the course within three years of
the initial course offering date, and PIs of missions subsequently
selected to enter Phase B will have a mandatory requirement to
complete the course within one year from their selection. The Mission
PI Training Course requirement is in addition to, and not a
substitute for, the experience requirements for the PIs of all
mission proposals submitted in response to SMD Announcements of 
Opportunity.

Enrollment for the course will be limited to approximately 35
participants per class offering.  NASA will cover the cost of the
course including all food and lodging, but participants will be
responsible for their own transportation to and from the course and
for their salary during the weeklong course.

To receive consideration for the initial course offering, please send
an email message with your electronic contact coordinates to
katherine.thomas@asrcms.com with "Register: Mission PI Training
Course" in the title.  Aspiring mission PIs should also include a
one-page summary of their relevant experience and describe their
interest in becoming a mission PI.  The email message must be
received by January 31, 2008 in order to receive consideration for
the initial course offering, and participants for the initial class
will be selected from among those responding.  Please forward any
questions about the course to katherine.thomas@asrcms.com with
"Question: Mission PI Training Course" in the title.

[NASA] ASTROBIOLOGY INSTITUTE PROPOSAL NOTICE

On January 8, 2008, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration
(NASA) Science Mission Directorate (SMD) is releasing a Cooperative
Agreement Notice (NNH08ZDA002C) soliciting new institutional members
to the NASA Astrobiology Institute (NAI).  The NAI CAN (Cycle-5) is
responsive to the recommendations of the recent NRC study (Assessment
of the NASA Astrobiology Institute, 2007. Go to 

http://www7.nationalacademies.org/ssb/

for the report. Proposers will be required to clearly articulate an 
innovative, interdisciplinary, astrobiology research program, together 
with plans to advance the full scope of NAI objectives as defined in 
the Institute's Mission Statement. See NAI website: 

http://nai.nasa.gov/ 

Proposers may also choose to focus their research on preparing for 
strategic mission objectives in astrobiology.  NASA anticipates making 
$10-12M per year available for this selection, leading to at least 7 
and possibly several more awards (approximately one-third of which will 
be focused on preparing for strategic mission objectives), each of 5 
years duration.

Notices of Intent (NOIs) are due February 22, 2008, and proposals are
due April 11, 2008.

Obtain additional programmatic information from: Dr. Carl Pilcher,
Director, NASA Astrobiology Insitute, Ames Research Center, Moffett
Field, CA 94035; Tel: (650) 604-0022; email: can5@nasa.gov.

[Editor Note: Upon its release date, this Cooperative Agreement
Notice will be available electronically from 
http://nspires.nasaprs.com/ (select "Solicitations" then select "Open
Solicitations" then select "NNH08ZDA002C").]

[NASA] PDS ANNOUNCES FIRST MESSENGER DATA RELEASE

The Planetary Data System announces the first release of data from 
the MErcury Surface, Space ENvironment, GEochemistry, and Ranging
(MESSENGER) mission. The release includes EDR level data acquired 
during cruise, the Earth flyby (Aug 2, 2005), and the 1st (Oct 24,
2006) and 2nd (June 5, 2007) Venus flybys. Not all instruments
acquired data during each of these mission phases.

Data sets from the following experiments are now available:

EPPS (Energetic Particle and Plasma Spectrometer) - PPI
GRNS (Gamma Ray and Neutron Spectrometer) - GEO
MAG (Magnetometer) - PPI
MASCS (Mercury Atmosphere and Surface Composition Spectrometer)
- ATM, GEO
MDIS(Mercury Dual Imaging System) - IMG
MLA (Mercury Laser Altimeter) - GEO
RS (Radio Science) - GEO
XRS (X-Ray Spectrometer) - GEO

SPICE kernels for all instruments are also available from the NAIF 
Node.

MESSENGER data are archived at the PDS Atmospheres (ATM),
Geosciences (GEO), Imaging (IMG), NAIF, and Planetary Plasma
Interactions (PPI) Nodes. The data can be accessed from these
nodes' web sites and from the main PDS home page: 

http://pds.nasa.gov.

2ND ANNUAL SMALL SPACECRAFT SUMMER STUDY PROGRAM (S4P)

Summer 2008

The University Affiliated Research Center at NASA Ames Research Center
in Mountain View, CA, will host its 2nd annual Small Spacecraft Summer
Study Program (S4P).  Twelve students will be selected to participate
in an in-depth 10-week mentorship program to develop and test ideas 
for small spacecraft exploration of Near Earth Objects ideas that 
will ultimately lead to a detailed mission proposal.

The UARC Systems Teaching Institute seeks highly motivated graduate  
students in electrical, mechanical, aerospace, and systems  
engineering, astrophysics, planetary sciences, and project or  
business management.  Advanced undergraduates with relevant  
experience will also be considered.

APPLICATION DEADLINE EXTENDED FOR 2008 LLOYD V. BERKNER SPACE POLICY 
INTERNSHIP PROGRAM

As part of its celebration of the 50th anniversary of its founding, 
the National Research Council's Space Studies Board (SSB) has expanded 
the scope of the Space Policy Intern program it has operated since 1992
by initiating the Lloyd V. Berkner Space Policy Internships. The goal 
of the program is to provide promising undergraduate and graduate 
students with the opportunity to work in the area of civil space 
research policy in the Nation's capital, under the aegis of the SSB. 
The Lloyd V. Berkner Space Policy Internships are offered twice 
annually. The summer program is restricted to undergraduates and the 
autumn program is open to both undergraduate and graduate students. The
deadline for applications for the summer 2008 program has been extended
to February 1, 2008. The deadline for applications to the autumn 
program is June 16, 2008. Additional details, including eligibility
