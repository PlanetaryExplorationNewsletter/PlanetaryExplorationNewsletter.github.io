[NASA] ADDITIONAL PROPOSAL OPPORTUNITY FOR ROSES EDUCATION AND PUBLIC 
OUTREACH SUPPLEMENTAL AWARDS

This amendment announces an additional proposal opportunity for
Education and Public Outreach supplemental awards. Principal
Investigators (PIs) of selected Science Mission Directorate (SMD)
research investigations may propose for Education or Outreach awards
as supplements to their research award. Two different pathways are
offered: $15K education pathway proposals and $10K outreach pathway 
proposals.

These proposal opportunities are described in Appendix E.8:
Supplemental Outreach Awards for ROSES Investigators and Appendix
E.9: Supplemental Education Awards for ROSES Investigators. The text
in Appendix E.8 and Appendix E.9 has also been revised and clarified
in response to questions submitted by the community.

Notices of Intent (NOIs) to propose for supplemental E/PO awards are
due March 11, 2009. Proposals for supplemental E/PO awards are due
April 8, 2009.

On or about December 16, 2008, this Amendment to the NASA Research
Announcement "Research Opportunities in Space and Earth Sciences
(ROSES) 2008" (NNH08ZDA001N) will be posted on the NASA research
opportunity homepage at 

http://nspires.nasaprs.com/ 
(select "Solicitations" then "Open Solicitations" then "NNH08ZDA001N")

Questions concerning the Supplemental Education/Outreach Awards for
ROSES Investigators may be addressed to Dr. Larry P. Cooper, Science
Mission Directorate, NASA Headquarters, Washington, DC 20546-0001;
Tel: 202-358-1531; E-mail: larry.p.cooper@nasa.gov.

[NASA] PROPOSAL OPPORTUNITY: SCIENCE EDUCATION AND PUBLIC OUTREACH 
FORUMS

On January 2, 2009, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration 
(NASA) Science Mission Directorate (SMD), is releasing a Cooperative 
Agreement Notice (NNH09ZDA004C) soliciting proposals for Science 
Education and Public Outreach Forums to collaborate with SMD in 
execution of its Education and Public Outreach (E/PO) program. The 
objective is to increase the overall coherence of the SMD E/PO 
program leading to more effective, sustainable, and efficient 
utilization of SMD discoveries and learning experiences.

It is anticipated that there will be a four awards with one Science
Education and Public Outreach Forum (SEPOF) being 
individually affiliated with each of the four SMD Science Divisions: 
Astrophysics, Earth Science, Heliophysics, and Planetary Science.  

NASA anticipates making $3.5 M per year available for this selection. 
Awards will be for 5 years duration. Upon its release date, 
this Cooperative Agreement Notice will be available from:

http://nspires.nasaprs.com/ 
(select "Solicitations" then select "Open Solicitations" then select
"NNH09ZDA004C").

Notices of Intent (NOIs) are due February 11, 2009, and proposals are
due April 9, 2009.

Additional information can be obtained from: Dr. Larry 
P. Cooper, E/PO Program Officer, Science Mission Directorate, NASA 
Headquarters, Washington, DC 20546; Tel: (202) 358-1531; email:

THE LUNAR EXPLORATION ROADMAP NEEDS YOU!

The Lunar Exploration Analysis Group (LEAG) needs your help once again.
Earlier in 2008, we asked from community input into the Themes and 
Goals of the Lunar Exploration Roadmap that the LEAG has been 
requested to develop for NASA.  We have taken that input and now have
driven down to Objectives and Investigations. We now need the 
community to review these and vote on their time-phasing and 
prioritization.  

Please note that this is a far more extensive web site and we are not
requesting that you respond to every question! 
We would like you to address those questions in the areas where your 
expertise is. 

YOUR INPUT IS VITAL FOR THE SUCCESS OF THIS ROADMAP, as it needs to be 
a community effort.

The web site can be found at:

https://www.lpi.usra.edu/survey/LER/

[NOTE: "LER" must be in capital letters]

This will bring up a log-in frame, where you enter: "leag"

Password: "moonorbust"

Make sure "leag" and the password are in lower case letters.

If you have any questions, please contact the LEAG Chair, Clive R. 
Neal at neal.1@nd.edu.
