SPECIAL: A BUDGET MESSAGE FROM ALAN STERN, ASSOCIATE ADMINISTRATOR FOR
NASA'S SCIENCE MISSION DIRECTORATE (SMD), NASA HEADQUARTERS

04 February 2008

A month ago today I wrote you an email via NSPIRES about the work 
being done in NASA's Science Mission Directorate (SMD) to invigorate 
the flight and research programs we're administering.

Although there was good news to talk about then, I could not discuss 
the content of the President's FY09 budget request and what that budget 
portends for SMD.

The President's FY09 budget was released today, so I am writing you 
again.

The news for NASA is good - we enjoyed a 1.8% funding increase that 
many other discretionary parts of the budget did not - and all of 
NASA's major programs are intact. As you can learn from reading budget 
documentation at http://www.nasa.gov, there are a host of important 
initiatives within NASA's budget request.

But in this message I want to focus on the highlights of the FY09 
budget request as it affects SMD, and to be to the point: that news is 
also good.

To begin, the FY09 President's request augments two areas of SMD's 
budget significantly - Earth science and lunar science. More 
specifically, the budget request includes new initiatives to accelerate 
the recommended flight missions of the Earth Science Decadal Survey 
(NRC, 2007), and to fly small lunar science missions that respond to 
goals of the 2007 NRC report, "Scientific Context for Exploration of 
the Moon".

Owing to budget wedges that are opening up as we launch a total of 13 
orbital and planetary missions in 2008 and 2009, to some missions that 
we replanned to gain efficiencies, and to some cost increases that we 
avoided, the budget request for SMD is able to go beyond the Earth 
Science and lunar science initiatives I just mentioned, to also 
initiate missions in planetary science, in astrophysics, and in 
heliophysics.

In fact the President's budget request allows SMD to initiate 7 new 
space missions. And it is worth pointing out that this exceeds the 
number of new SMD missions initiated in the past three NASA budgets 
combined.

The 7 new missions to be initiated by the President's FY09 budget 
request span all four of SMD's Divisions; they are:

* The Earth Science Division's SMAP soil moisture mission for launch 
in 2012 and IceSat II decadal survey mission for launch in 2015. Three 
additional Earth science decadal survey missions will be enabled by 
this budget request as well.
* The Heliophysics Division's new, lower cost Solar Probe mission for 
launch in 2015.
* The Planetary Science Division's long awaited Outer Planets Flagship 
for launch in 2016 or 2017, depending on the mission target and 
trajectory.
* The Astrophysics Division's highly anticipated JDEM dark energy 
mission for launch by 2015.
* And two new lunar robotic missions - a small science orbiter to 
launch by 2011 and a pair of mini-landers for launch by 2014; these 
lunar missions are to be developed in SMD's Planetary Science Division. 

If Congress agrees to these plans, then in FY09 (which begins in 
October!) you will be seeing a great deal of activity to solicit 
proposals to select payloads and science teams for these 7 new 
missions. 

The President's budget request also significantly increases R&A funding 
so that our program generates more discoveries and therefore provides 
the taxpayer with value from the missions we fly. The budget request 
also substantially increases funding for suborbital sounding rockets 
and balloon experiments in order to foster PI on-ramps, instrument 
technology demonstrations, and of course new science.

To learn more, you can find many details at http://www.nasa.gov .  

Additionally we in SMD will be talking about this new budget at the 
next round of the NASA Advisory Council (NAC) and NAC subcommittee 
meetings, at MOWGs, with the leadership of professional societies such 
as the AGU, AAS, DPS, and AMS, and at upcoming large scientific 
gatherings such as LPSC, AAS, and AGU.

The primary message I hope you have received from this note is that 
the future that the President's FY09 budget request paints is bright 
for SMD.

As I said in my message of January 4th, we continue to look to the 
Earth and space science research communities for advice, counsel, 
feedback, and most importantly, new results as we go forward, so I 
again invite that advice through your NAC subcommittees and 
professional societies.

I hope to see many of you in meetings and other venues in the coming 
weeks. In the meantime, best wishes.

Alan Stern
