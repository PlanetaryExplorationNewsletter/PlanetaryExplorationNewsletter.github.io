[NASA] ADVISORY COUNCIL PLANETARY SCIENCE SUBCOMMITTEE MEETING COMING
UP

The next meeting of the Planetary Science Subcommittee of the NASA
Advisory Council will be on 23-24 June in room E100E of Building 1 at 
the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center.

The agenda will include program status reports and the results of 
studies on the drivers for cost overruns and schedule slips. The
meeting is open to the public up to the capacity of the room.
Attendees must sign a register and comply with NASA security 
requirements, including the presentation of a valid picture ID, before
receiving an access badge.  

Foreign nationals attending this meeting will be required to provide
the following information no less than 15 working days prior to the
meeting:  

Full Name
Gender
Date/Place of Birth
Citizenship
Social Security Number
Green Card Information (Resident Alien Number, Expiration Date)
Visa Information (Number, Type, Expiration Date)
Passport Information (Number, Country of Issue, Expiration Date)
Employer/Affiliation Information (Name of Institution, Title/Position,
Address, Country of Employer, Telephone, Email Address);
Title/Position of Attendee.  

U.S. citizens can provide identifying information 4 working days in
advance by contacting Marian Norris via email at mnorris@nasa.gov or

[NASA] NEW DUE DATE FOR PLANETARY MISSION DATA ANALYSIS

This amendment delays the due dates for Appendix C.11 entitled 
"Planetary Mission Data Analysis." The objective of the Planetary 
Mission Data Analysis program (PMDAP) is to enhance the scientific 
return of planetary science missions by broadening the scientific 
participation in the analysis of data and samples collected by those 
missions. This delay in the proposal due date will allow MESSENGER 
data from the January 2008 Mercury flyby to be eligible for PMDAP 
investigations.  The MESSENGER data will be made public through the 
PDS on July 15, which will be 30 days before the new proposal due date.

The proposal due date has been delayed from August 8, 2008, to August 
15, 2008. The due date for Notices of Intent (NOIs) to propose 
remains June 6, 2008.

On or about June 4, 2008, this Amendment to the NASA Research 
Announcement "Research Opportunities in Space and Earth Sciences 
(ROSES) 2008" (NNH08ZDA001N) will be posted on the NASA research 
opportunity homepage at

http://nspires.nasaprs.com/ (select "Solicitations" then "Open 
Solicitations" then "NNH08ZDA001N").

[NASA] SMALL BODIES ASSESSMENT GROUP CREATED

The Small Bodies Assessment Group (SBAG) was established by NASA
in  2008 to identify scientific priorities and opportunities for
the exploration of asteroids, comets, interplanetary dust, small
satellites, transneptunian objects, meteors, and meteorites. SBAG
also provides scientific input on the utility of asteroids and
comets in support of human space activities. The group comprises
several topical focus groups of open membership and a Steering
Committee. SBAG is chaired by Faith Vilas, Director of the MMT
Observatory, who will represent the interests of this group as a  
member of the Planetary Science Subcommittee of the NASA Advisory
Council.

The SBAG will conduct a town hall meeting at ACM 2008 at 8 pm on
July 14 to which all interested colleagues are invited.

The inaugural formal meeting of the SBAG will be held in Washington,
DC, September 23-24, 2008 at a location TBD. The meeting is open to
all those interested in small bodies research and exploration. For
more information about SBAG and the meeting, please go to

EPSC 2008: DEADLINE FOR ABSTRACT SUBMISSION EXTENDED TO JUNE 13, 2008

Dear colleagues,

The Scientific Organizing Committee of the EPSC 2008 realised that they
did not give you very long for EPSC abstract submission, and that the
possibility of extended abstracts took many by surprise.

So they have given you a further few days, and the deadline for
submission is now extended to 13 June 2008.

Please submit abstracts using the meeting website:

http://meetings.copernicus.org/epsc2008/

2ND ANNOUNCEMENT: COSMIC CATACLYSMS AND LIFE, ESRIN (FRASCATI, ITALY),
10-14 NOVEMBER 2008

Abstract Deadline: 17 June 2008

A number of cataclysms have occurred in the history of the universe and
the Solar System. The Symposium will review those that had a critical
influence on the evolution of habitable worlds and on the emergence and
survival of life on Earth, and possibly elsewhere.  The sessions will
discuss the following topics:

Big Bang and the formation of light elements
Element nucleosynthesis in stars and Supernovae Violent processes in
star formation
Interstellar/circumstellar shocks and the synthesis of molecules
Collisions and planetary formation
Formation of the Moon and its influence on Earth 
Late heavy bombardment and the emergence of life 
The role of impacts in inhibiting, transporting or threatening life 
Hazards from stellar flares and space weather 
Hazards from black holes and gamma ray bursts 
Cosmic habitability
Prevalence of Earth-like planets
The fate of the Earth 
Historical, outreach and education aspects of cataclysms (e.g. 
Tunguska 1908)

Updated information about the Workshop will be made on the web site:
