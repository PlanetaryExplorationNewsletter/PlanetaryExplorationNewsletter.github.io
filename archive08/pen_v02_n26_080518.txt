[NASA] NEW FRONTIERS PROGRAM COMMUNITY ANNOUNCEMENT

May 12, 2008

The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Science
Mission Directorate (SMD) plans to release for community comment a
draft Announcement of Opportunity (AO) for the third New Frontiers
mission (NF-3) in September 2008. Approximately two weeks after the
draft is released, SMD will hold a community workshop in the
Washington, D.C., area. The final AO will be released in December
2008 with proposals due approximately 90 days later. In August 2009,
up to three missions will be selected for a 9 to 11 month Phase A
that will be funded up to $2.5M each. Downselection to a single
mission for flight will occur in fall (September to November) 2010.
Launch is to occur no earlier than 2015 and no later than 2018. This
NF-3 AO will solicit only missions that do not require nuclear
sources for power generation or propulsion, although Radioisotope
Heating Units (RHUs) and calibration sources will be allowed. The
Principal Investigator (PI) Mission Cost for all phases of the
mission will not include the launch vehicle and will be capped at
$650M in FY09 dollars.

Questions may be addressed to Dr. Adriana C. Ocampo, New Frontiers
Program Executive, Science Mission Directorate, NASA, Washington, DC

[NASA] SPICE TRAINING CLASS

NASA's Navigation and Ancillary Information Facility (NAIF) has
tentatively scheduled the next SPICE training class, to be held near
Pasadena CA on October 21-24 (to be confirmed). Details may be found
from a link on the NAIF home page:

THE GREAT PLANET DEBATE: A SCIENTIFIC CONFERENCE AND EDUCATOR's 
WORKSHOP

August 14 - 16, 2008
Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory
Laurel, Maryland, USA

Online registration for the above meeting is now available at:

http://gpd.jhuapl.edu/

The deadline for abstracts and early registration is June 27, 2008.

During the first two days of the conference, speakers will present 
what we have learned about planetary bodies after more than 40 years
of robotic exploration of the Solar System and what we are learning
about planets around other stars. The characteristics and criteria
used to define and categorize planets, including the IAU's
dynamical-based definition and alternative geophysical-based
definitions, will be discussed and debated.

The invited speakers are leading researchers in the field of planetary
system formation and evolution. The schedule of talks can be found at:

http://gpd.jhuapl.edu/schedule/

The third day of the meeting will be an Educator's Workshop to discuss
how the question of "The Great Planet Debate" should be treated in
schools and how that can be used as a springboard to discuss
science as a process, as well as other topics in planetary science.

Meeting Organizers: Mark Sykes, Hal Weaver, and Keith Noll

FIRST ANNOUNCEMENT - SPITZER 2008 CONFERENCE "NEW LIGHT ON YOUNG STARS"

October 26-30 2008, Hilton Hotel, Pasadena CA

You are cordially invited to participate in the 2008 Spitzer Science
Center Conference on circumstellar disks.

The unprecedented infrared sensitivity of the Spitzer Space Telescope 
has enabled major advances in the study of protostellar, 
protoplanetary, and debris disks.  Now, as Spitzer nears the 
transition from cryogenic to warm mission, it is an opportune time
to assess and synthesize recent progress in our understanding of 
circumstellar disks and focus on the outstanding science questions 
for future work.  At the meeting, results from Spitzer's surveys
of circumstellar matter in the Milky Way will be considered in the
context of work at other wavelengths and underlying theory in the
following topic areas:

- Surveys of star-formation regions
- Effects of environment and central object on disk properties
- Structure of protostellar/protoplanetary disks and envelopes
- Spectroscopic diagnostics of circumstellar gas and dust
- Transition disks, disk evolution, and planet formation
- Frequency, structure, and theory of debris disks
